i was pulled into this movie early on, much to my surprise, because i hadn't intended to watch it at all. now i wish i hadn't. the suspense starts out well, with the hit-and-run resulting in death and the question of whether the guilty character will confess, or be found out, or (doable now, though a no-no in the old days of movie-making) get away with it. the plot's been done before--what plot hasn't--but the tensions inherent in it, with the additional complications and motivations arising out of the illicit love affair, make for an absorbing first half. then the film abandons the hit-and-run to embark upon a misty exposition of two unrequited, all-suffering loves. the two tracks of plot--hit-and-run and unreasoning love--just don't have enough to do with each other, and that they involve the same characters doesn't bind them enough to justify the departure from the original story line. the screenwriter should have chosen one plot or the other. at the end of the film, in the midst of the movie's second funeral, i found myself thinking, "now, what does any of this have to do with that hit-and-run?" the filmmakers may think the answer obvious, but i think the movie was plotted and executed flabbily.

sure, most of the slasher films of the 1980's were not worth thecelluloid they were filmed on, but this video nightmare may well bethe dullest produced.six horny pot smoking students decide to go camping. of course,and you know this already, they begin getting killed one by one by amysterious stranger. the climax has a hunky forest ranger trying toget to the teens in time before the last cute girl becomes buzzardbait.john carl buechler, my least favorite b-movie guy, did the lousymakeup effects here. the cast features carel struycken, of "thewitches of eastwick" and the addams family movies. sadly, hedoes not pop up until the very end of the film, and is covered inburn makeup, rendering him unrecognizable. steve bond (anyoneremember him?) is here in an early role as a victim.brown's direction, and the script he cowrote, both smell like thepresents brown bears leave in the woods. he pads the film withso much stock wilderness footage, i thought i accidentally rented aspecial episode of mutual of omaha's wild kingdom. much of thecast sits around the campfire and eats, then walk, and sit and eatagain. the forest ranger is involved in the strangest scene ever putin a slasher film: he tells a joke about a wide mouthed frog to ababy deer. jackie coogan, who must have forgot he once workedwith the legends of silent cinema, has two scenes, and is involvedin the second strangest scene ever put in a slasher film: he andthe hunky forest ranger have a conversation about cucumber andcream cheese sandwiches on oatmeal bread...yeah.there is not one minute of suspense here. the killer, a forest firesurvivor looking for a mate, watches the students from behindtrees. we know it is the killer because the film makers havedubbed in a heart beat sound effect that helpfully serves to wakethe viewer up every few minutes. skip this pile of pine sap and rent"halloween," instead.this is rated (r) for physical violence, mild gun violence, gore,some profanity, brief female nudity, mild sexual content, sexualreferences, and drug abuse.

i think that would have been a more appropriate title for this film, since it is padded to hell and back with stock footage of various bugs and animals. i recently found the prey in its original vhs 'big box' form and was very excited. i just love finding old slasher films on vhs because the cover artwork is fantastic. usually though, it turns out that the film itself is less than fantastic. the prey is one of those films.to be fair, it started off ok, with the killer stalking the cliché teenagers in the woods. the heartbeat sounds used are a great effect that make you tense as you watch. this film is basically a big fat cliché, and when the "campfire stories" section rolls in, the film takes a new direction and spends almost half of the running time on the back-story of the killer. i actually thought this was quite an original idea. however, the back-story ends abruptly and shows us some stock-footage of a burning woodland (the lack of budget really starts to show now). after this, we are returned to the dumb teenagers being picked off in the woods. the killer himself isn't shown until the end, which is a shame because he actually makes an effective looking killer. sort of like cropsy from the burning, but better. as for gore, there isn't too much, although there's an ok face squishing moment at the end. overall, i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone other than slasher completists - it really is a big mess.

oh yeah, this one is definitely a strong contender to win the questionable award of "worst 80's slasher ever made". "the prey" has got everything you usually want to avoid in a horror flick: a routine, derivative plot that you've seen a thousand times before (and better), insufferable characters and terrible performances, a complete lack of gore and suspense, fuzzy photography and unoriginal locations and  most irritating of all  the largest amount of pointless padding footage you've ever encountered in your life (and that's not an exaggeration but a guarantee!). apart from the seemingly endless amount of national geographic stock footage, which i'll expand upon later, this film is shameless enough to include a complete banjo interlude (!) and two occasions where characters tell dillydally jokes that aren't even remotely funny! the set-up is as rudimentary as it gets, with the intro showing images of a devastating forest fire with ott voice-over human screams. fast forward nearly forty years later, when an elderly couple out camping in that same area get axe-whacked by something that breathes heavily off-screen. this ought to be enough information for you to derive that someone survived the fire all these years ago and remained prowling around ever since. enter three intolerable twenty something couples heading up to the danger zone with exclusively sex on their minds, unaware of course they are sitting ducks for the stalking and panting killer. "the prey" is an irredeemable boring film. apparently it was shot in 1978 already, but nobody wanted to distribute it up until 1984 and it isn't too hard to see why. in case you would filter out all the content that is actually relevant, this would only be a short movie with a running time of 30 minutes; possibly even less. there's an unimaginably large of nature and wildlife footage, sometimes of animals that i think don't even live in that type of area, and they seem to go on forever. the only thing missing, in fact, is the typical national geographic narration providing educational information regarding the animals' habits. animals in their own natural biotope are undeniably nice to look at, but not in a supposedly vile and cheesy 80's slasher movie, for crying out loud. the last fifteen minutes are finally somewhat worthwhile, with some potent killing sequences and fine make-up effects on the monster (who turns out to be lurch from "the addams family" movies), but still silliness overrules  the scene with the vultures is too stupid  and the final shot is just laugh-out-loud retarded. as mentioned above, "the prey" easily makes my own personal list of worst 80's slashers, alongside "appointment with fear", "berserker", "deadly games", "don't go in the woods", "hollow gate", "the stay awake" and "curfew".

supercraptastic slasher fare, which feels overly long at 80 minutes. years ago, a bunch of "gypsies" who lived in the caves of a mountain, were burned up in a forest fire. years later, campers are going missing from the area of the fire. a bunch of horny kids are, of course, en route to this area for a debaucherous camping trip of there own. despite an ominous welcome from the forest ranger (jackson bostwick) the kids troop up to the mountain any way. before long, the kids start to get picked off by the monster, who remains unseen to the very end of the movie, probably because the makeup was so embarrassingly bad. no surprises to speak of: they get killed in the exact order that the formula for these movies dictates, leaving the "final girl" to fend for herself, although in a refreshingly downbeat denouement, the final girl ends up imprisoned and impregnated by the monster.the story itself couldn't hold the weight of feature length, so it was padded out by seemingly endless shots of wildlife and insects, which were obviously shot for another film and inserted here haphazardously as a means of making the movie long enough for a video release. on the plus side, the wildlife footage is rather nice. also among the highlights are bostwick talking to a baby deer, a decent rock-climbing death sequence, ok gore, and the great jackie coogan in his final film role, as the bumbling local sheriff. this is a far cry from charlie chaplin, but it was still nice to see him. this is for slasher completists only.

this tale of the upper-classes getting their come-uppance and wallowing in their high-class misery is like a contemporary mid-sommerish version of an old joan crawford movie in which she suffered in mink. here, people behave in a frightfully civilized manner in the face of adversity. a well-heeled london solicitor, (tom wilkinson), discovers that not only is his wife having an affair with the local gentry but that she has also killed their housekeeper's husband in a hit-and-run accident. he throws up, but otherwise his stiff-upper-lip hardly quavers.written and directed by julian fellowes, who won an oscar for writing "gosford park", (this is his directorial debut), from a novel by nigel balchin, it's quite comical although i am not sure how much of the comedy is intended. it's like a throw-back to british films of the forties where characters all behaved like characters in books or plays rather than like people might in real life. however, it's not all bad. wilkinson is terrific, even if you never believe in him as a person while emily watson, (the adulterous wife), and rupert everett, (the highly amoral high-class totty), are both very good at covering the cracks in the material. tony pierce-roberts' cinematography ensures that no matter how hard it is on the ear it's always good on the eye.

seeing this film for the first time twenty years after its release i don't quite get it. why has this been such a huge hit in 1986? its amateurishness drips from every scene. the jokes are lame and predictable. the sex scenes are exploitative and over the top (that is not to say that miss rudnik does not have nice boobs!). the singing is "schrecklich". the only genuinely funny scene is the big shoot out when the gangsters die break dancing, a trait that dates the movie firmly to the mid-eighties. it's really quite puzzling to me how incapable i am to grasp what evoked the enthusiasm of the cheering audiences in 1986 (and apparently still today, reading my fellow imdbers comments).

describing this film is a difficult task. on the one hand, it's an over-the-top vampire spookfest, complete with cobwebs, eerie music, a hypnotic medallion, and of course a coffin with a creaky lid.on the other hand, this is one of the silliest scripts this side of edward d. wood, jr. produced by the same people who gave us "the bloody vampire," "invasion of the vampires," and this film's predecessor, the modestly-titled "the vampire," the movie sticks close to the lack of logic that characterizes the other films.as i mentioned, this film is a sequel to "the vampire," which i have not seen. but no matter...it's real easy to imagine what happened. dr. enrique, played by abel "the brainiac" salazar, is befuddled when the well-intentioned but misguided dr. marion brings back the staked body of his vampiric enemy, count karol de lavud (i suppose there is a rule somewhere that all vampires must be counts of some sort). dr. marion complains that all important doctors throughout history have had to resort to some sort of grave robbing in order to advance their medical studies, and he hopes to use the vampire's corpse to study such phenomena as the vampire's lack of a normal reflection (at which point he holds a mirror up to the vampire and instead of no reflection, we see the vampire's skeleton. ???).enrique is not pleased, and seems determined to pass off the events of the first film as mere fantasy and superstition. "this man was no vampire...i'll admit that he liked to drink a little blood, but that's all!" he states. also confusing matters is the fragile martha, a part-time nurse and part-time showgirl (!) who happens to be enrique's object of affection. martha narrowly escaped de lavud's clutches in the first film, and apparently enrique has spent a great deal of time "healing her mind" and getting her to think that everything that she experienced was not real.ok, so if you were the scriptwriter for this film, you would need a way to get someone dumb enough to pull the stake out of the vampire, right? well, how about the greedy con man who helped marion steal the coffin? after getting a glimpse de lavud's body, he sets his sights on the expensive-looking brooch that the count is wearing, and he conveniently returns to steal it when the doctors aren't looking. but darn it...he can't remove the brooch because of the stake, so...you guessed it. de lavud is on the loose again, this time with the shady con as his human henchman.ok, so of course the vampire is after martha again, and meanwhile the doctors are really confused about what they believe. at first they are determined to prove that there is no such thing as a real vampire, then by the end of the film they are trying to get the police to put an all-points bulletin out for "a man who is dead but still alive!".you can probably imagine the rest of the plot from here, but the filmmakers do throw in a few pleasing twists. one of the sets for the movie is a spooky wax museum (is there any other kind in these types of films?), complete with a fully-equipped torture chamber...with real torture and execution equipment. the movie has a very keen sense of style, and not just in the campy cobwebs. one effectively creepy sequence has de lavud chasing a victim down a seemingly endless series of streets and alleyways, following their progress alongside vague buildings with no doors while lighting the scene like a german expressionist nightmare ("the cabinet of dr. caligari" seems to be an influence).but the rest of the film is juvenile, particularly in the film's climax. the special effects are quite crude, even for the year that this was made, and the climactic fight with de lavud in bat form is laughable enough...but the director feels the need to ask us to believe that martha would faint and collapse directly over top of a guillotine, positioned so that her head was in the perfect location to be chopped off by the blade, which is in danger of falling because the restraining rope has suddenly begun to fray right at that very minute! what an unfortunate coincidence! to make matters worse, he cuts away from the fraying rope to scenes of enrique trying to dodge the swooping rubber bat, basically standing still and waving his arms around. it's definitely an ed wood moment if ever there was one, especially when martha seems to revive on her own and rises groggily to her feet just as the blade slams down. whew! what a relief! in terms of kookiness, "the vampire's coffin" does not have the lunacy factor of "the bloody vampire" or "invasion of the vampires", but fans of these types of old horror films will appreciate the atmospheric photography, and the fact that the director manages to wring some real chills from this material has to "count" for something (haw haw).

imagine yourself trapped inside a museum of the dark middle ages and a resurrected vampire and his maniacal sidekick are chasing you. where is the absolute last place you want to hide? i'd say inside the uncanny virgin of nuremberg torture device, because there's a good risk you'll get brutally spiked to death. and yet, the elderly lady in this film stupidly runs into her spiked coffin. "the vampire's coffin" is a rather disappointing sequel, as director fernando méndez doesn't re-create the gothic atmosphere of the 1957-original but puts the emphasis on comical situations and dialogs. no more ominous castles with eerie cobwebs and dark vaults, but confused doctors and clumsy assistants that provoke laughs instead of frights. the story opens inside count de lavud's final resting place, where an eminent doctor and a hired assistant steal the coffin in order to examine the corpse at a private clinic. naturally the wooden stake gets removed from his heart, and the vampire count comes to live again, immediately enslaving the petty thief to do his dirty work. the vampire has his eye on a beautiful female patient at the clinic, and it's up to dr. enrique saldívar to rescue her soul and to destroy the bloodsucker. "the vampire's coffin" uses a limited amount of locations and there's very little action. the whole film would actually be pretty boring if it weren't for a handful of memorable sequences and decent acting performances. the photography is amazing, though, with the sublime use of shadows and darkness. this is most notably during the scene in which count de lavud stalks a young woman through the deserted streets of little town at night. it's the only truly worthwhile scene of the whole film, the rest is fairly mediocre and déjà-vu.

ik know it is impossible to keep all details of a book in a movie. but this movie has changed nearly everything without any reason. furthermore many changes have made the story illogical. a few examples: 1) in the movie "paul renauld" really meets poriot before he dies (in the book poirot only gets a letter), telling him he is afraid to be killed. this is completely stupid because if renaulds plan would have succeeded, poirot would have known that the dead man would not have been renauld.(poirot was in the morgue when mrs renauld identified the victim). 2) the movie has "combined" two persons into one! "cinderella" has been removed by the movie. the girl hastings falls in love with and the ex-girlfriend of jack renauld are one person in the movie! why for god's sake? 3)hastings finds the victims cause he is such a bad golf player. totally unfunny and stupid. 4) the movie tells secrets much too early (for example at the very beginning). so you know things you shouldn't know. 5) the murderer gets shot at the end by a person who doesn't exists in the book. perhaps because the person ("cinderella") who stops the murderer does not exists in the movie. 6)the book is very complex. the movie takes only about 90 minutes. sure it is difficult to include all the necessary details but it is impossible if you include stupid things which were not in the book and have no meaning (e.g. bicycle race).

oh f*cking hell, where should i start... first of all; this show is just another stupid american non-funny so called comedy which has pathetic acting and very very poor humor. the american way of laughing-track business makes the whole thing even worse. how come i can hear laughter, yet there's nothing funny happening? pretty stupid, eh? this show is only for those american people who haven't ever heard that there are far more funnier, better and wittier comedies - not only in great brittain, but also in america (the simpsons for example). i simply can't understand what is so good about "reba" that it has lasted for long a while in television. it has nothing new to offer, it underestimates the (possible) viewers in so many ways and it simply isn't funny at all. i could have lived with the fact that there are so bad shows as "reba", but why the hell they had to run it here in finland. if i see few seconds of this horrible show the rest of the day is ruined for me. take my word and believe me - this show sucks ass even more than these kind of american "comedies" usually does. this is simply horrible. do yourself a favor; don't ever watch this peace of sh*t. well i leave the commenting for those who now this language better. thanks for your (possible) interest.

my parents may enjoy this show, but i fail to find the humor in it. what is so funny about a dentist husband impregnating his hygienist assistant and the oldest daughter getting impregnated by the captain of the high school football team? absolutely nothing! it's a shock to me sometimes what people think constitutes humor nowadays. blame that on shows like "the dating game" and "the newlywed game" bringing the issue of sex to the forefront in the mid-1960s. sure, the series has its touching moments, still that's no excuse for the content that otherwise went into this series. this is nothing like the family-oriented days of "i love lucy" some five decades before. an answer i would have to why this series plays on the lifetime cable channel is because that channel's brass think women can relate to reba's character! i absolutely dislike the character of reba hart's daughter, kyra. she is best described as a ditsy and bitter teenager! funny, i wonder if the actress who played kyra; scarlett pomers, is like that in real life away from acting. who plays the blockhead ex-husband dentist, christopher rich, is not much better. barbara jean, played by melissa peterman, is ditsy in herself! the characters of van and cheyenne are also very annoying.something else that baffles me is why the dingbat-of-a-series creator, allison m. gibson, decided to set the series in where i live 25 miles away from; houston, texas! reba mcentire isn't even from this state, she's an oklahoman! why is it during one season or more they decided to make the incidental music sound like a pig snorting? what i mean by that is where we hear this baritone saxophone being played with drums accompanying it, but the melodies are basically tuneless!

reba is a very dumb show. you can predict pretty much anything that's about to happen. barbra jean is just too stupid. it's like she's not even a character. a show like this should at least have someone who resembles a real-life person. i guess barbra jean represents a retarded person. keira or whatever her name is, reba, brock, they're all stupid! keira is like the smartest person on the show, and she's still stupid. everyone is stupid! that's my opinion on reba. since i have said all i can say about this show, i'll just take up the next few lines of text by saying what i am currently saying right now and do it until there's 10 lines. there. reba gets 2/10.

reba is , without a doubt , one of the worst "comedy" series ever. i wonder how come there are people writing good comments on "reba" ... you watch "friends" , "married wtih children" , "fraizer" if you laugh at that , you can never laugh at the stupid jokes and the ridiculous accent of the singer who is trying to make her way in comedy and obviously having no chance whatsoever. the actors/actresses beside reba are ok so i feel bad for them stucking in a so-called comedy show with the least funnies person in the world (reba).to sum up , i suggest this tv show to see how low comedy can get and appreciate the ones that can make you laugh

reba sucks. it sucks hard. it's about this awful country singer attempting comedy. they might as well call this show "generic", because that's what it is. it's dumb and generic. reba, you're not funny, and i'm glad your retarded show was cancelled because you suck, and so does brock, barbra jean, the red-headed teenager, that jockey guy, and the 12 year old who got knocked up. you all suck, and none of you are funny. oh, and i heard a rumor that reba is actually a gay devil-worshipper who idolizes hitler and tortures animals. and she puts subliminal messages on her show and in her "music" in hopes to make children kill their parents and kill themselves! but it was just a rumor. anyway, this is the worst show ever, reba is gay, i do not like her, i think the office is better than this show, and this show sucks.

this really is an "okay" series.. everyone in it is pretty good. but i just can't take reba. she's trying to be funny but she just isn't and then she got a stupid accent!! if they took her out of the show i would love to see it every day..i have been watching the show in 10 min now and as i said before, reba is destroying the show. however the 20 year old guy (dont know his name) but he's soooo funny, and he's really saving it all..so here's the recipe to get a great show. kick reba of it and then put the 20 year old guy into the lead role.i really hope someone out there agrees with me and thinks (like me) that they should kick reba of the show and put someone else in the lead role

i pretty much liked every character on this show from the start except reba herself. she comes off as an holier than thou type and quite frankly a big bully. and that stinks because she is in every scene and every episode. in the later seasons van becomes unlikeable too,like a spoof of his former self. and kyra walks around sneering and being miserable.the first 3 to 4 seasons are pretty good if you overlook reba. towards the end its pretty bleak.. in basically every episode barbara jean is walking around being dumb,reba is being mean to her,but poor ole barbara jean desperately wants reba to like her which results in barabara jean telling reba how awesome she is in every episode. i think it is pretty clear to see reba has self esteem issues and wants to be seen as this all forgiving saint. its really a shame too because other than her the show had such potential.

does anyone else think that "reba" is basically a ripoff of "roseanne"? just look at the characters from the two families, connors (roseanne) and harts (reba) ; the blonde bombshell elder daughter (becky connor and cheyenne hart) who's married to a moron (mark healy and van montgomery), the sarcastic brunette younger daughter (darlene connor and kyra hart), the little brother (dj connor and jake hart), and the quirky relative (jackie connor and barbara-jean booker hart). and then, of course, there is the biggest similarity, reba hart and roseanne connor. "reba" tried to copy the sarcastic and tough-love style mom without giving her the same lovable qualities as roseanne had. or, perhaps, they made her *too* lovable, for reba hart seems to waver between being mean and scary (hence van's line to his wife cheyenne "i'm not afraid of you, i'm afraid of your mother!") and being sweet and caring with little transition in between. roseanne at least managed to get it across that she was being cruel to be kind, since she was always mean and sarcastic and, whenever she tried to open up, it was hard for her. as inconsistent as reba's character is, it's hard for her to be believable. but even if the characters weren't completely ripped off of "roseanne", nothing could've saved the show from being sub-par in the plot area. the writers try to give the show substance but they really can't lay off the corny jokes long enough to give any impact. and you'd better believe the jokes are corny; it's as if they were written by a twelve-year-old who thinks that any joke is hilarious. while occasionally they come out with something that's funny (i don't pretend that i didn't laugh at a few episodes) these gems are too few and far between to make "reba" witty. overall, "reba" is a very mediocre show with obvious ripoffs of "roseanne", sub-par plots and sub-sub-par humor, and (let's face it) terrible acting. the show might be a bit better, actually, if they replaced all the actors, especially reba herself, who is more community- theater quality than prime-time sitcom quality. i give it a 3 out of 10 just to be fair to the good jokes that make it in.

i have yet to watch starcrash (1979) - that notoriously cheesy italian take on star wars (1977) - but it can't be much worse than this misbegotten piece of junk which, suffice it to say, makes mel brooks' so-so spaceballs (1987) look like a veritable work of art! in fact, the main reason why galaxina is remembered at all nowadays is because of the tragic fate which befell its leading lady - playboy centerfold dorothy stratten who was killed by her insanely jealous estranged husband - before the film had even had its official premiere! although statten (who subsequently had two biopics made about her wherein she was portrayed by jamie lee curtis and mariel hemingway) plays the title role, for the first half of the film she is reduced to being propped up in a chair ostensibly driving a spaceship on a 27-year journey to some planet or other; in fact, galaxina is an all-purpose android who also serves the wacky crew their snacks, gets them all hot under the collar and even goes scouting for the blue star (cue choral music) once they land! having said that, statten certainly looks luminous in her white attire and, even if her role hardly demands much exertion of any acting talent she might possess, it's not exactly demeaning either.still, it's ironic that for a film which bears her name, she is overshadowed by the campy and would-be zany antics of her fellow crew members, especially the annoying captain cornelius butt (which gives you the idea of the level of comedy on display here), a long-eared, wing-sporting colored guy, a pot-smoking, proverb-quoting old chinaman and, best of all (relatively speaking) a foul-mouthed, rock-eating, hairy alien creature they hold prisoner. the villain of the piece is a metal-clad non-entity who does, however, have the best laugh in the film when, upon hearing the choral music following his every mention of the blue star, exclaims, "what is this s**t?" there is little point in listing the sci-fi classics which are mauled by this stinker in its ludicrous attempts at spoofing the genre since they are not only lame but obvious; incredibly enough, a chest-busting but ultimately benign alien is apparently played by diminutive hollywood veteran, angelo rossitto!for what it's worth, then, the scenes shot on the planet they visit (which looks more like a western set than a planetary landscape) have a yellowish, sun-like hue and its inhabitants are 'human gourmets' (delicacies on their menu include skin and tonic, scotsman on the rocks, thigh pies, baked alaskan, etc), not to mention a motorcycle gang who serve their own particular deity (the harley davidson) and when our heroes escape on the back of it, they dare not shoot at them for fear of hitting their "lord". god(awful) indeed...

this picture hit the movie screens on june 6th 1980, starring stephen macht as sergeant thor, avery schreiber as captain comelius butt, j.d. hinton as buzz and starring playmate of the year dorothy stratton. the picture starts with the police infinity roaming space looking for i guess criminals. there ship is suddenly attacked by an unknown space ship. enters sergeant thor and his partner buzz as they try to figure out who the unknown ship belongs to. when failing they call on captain comelius who instructs his crew to fight back. enters the gorgeous dorothy stratton, who plays the role of galaxina who is man made robot. an now a few thoughts on this picture. this movie was plan stupid and it's one of the reasons that i don't get into sci-fi. if you're into sci-fi you would have notice that the laser sound effects were borrowed from an early sci-fi movie titled battlestar galactica which aired in theaters in 1978. many of the door sounds that you hear in this movie came from another sci-fi movie that aired back in 1966 titled star trek. now for the reason that i bought this movie, dorothy stratton. she is gorgeous in her one piece suit. i think her talents were wasted in this picture and she should have never been involved in such garbage. connie sellecca was also considered for the role and her talents would have been wasted also. on the picture alone i give this movie 1 weasel star and on dorothy stratton i give her 10 weasel stars even though she didn't deserve to be put into a trash movie like this. if you like pictures like this you can get the dvd version on amazon.com

for connoisseurs of bad movies, galaxina is a true gem. with truly horrid dialog, acting, and directing, it's no choice for people seeking a proper movie. but as one of the most unintentionally hilarious movies of its genre, it's priceless for a good laugh. in particular, the scenes involving the harley davidson-worshiping motorcycle cult are especially good, and many other scenes present an opportunity for a cheap laugh.sadly, the scenes with dorothy stratten really fail to deliver, but since she's playing an android, i suppose one can excuse her for wooden acting.bad movie-lovers, don't pass this one up!

... what a porn movie would look like if you took out the sex and just left in the bad dialog, cheap sets and bad acting, you would have galaxina.this film came out when the original star wars proved there was a market for science fiction. this in turn lead to some gems such as alien and a revitalized star trek. unfortunately, it also led to some bad movies, and this was obviously one of them. (i say obviously, because i hadn't even heard of this film until a few days ago.i missed it when it came out in 1980.) here's the underlying problem. dorothy stratton couldn't act, so for most of the movie, they didn't even let her try. i understand her tragic death has given this film an undeserved cult status, but for the life of me i can't understand why.clearly, the movie tried to spoof star wars, star trek and aliens, but they clearly don't understand than when you spoof something, it has to be funny! this movie wasn't, or at least, the comic timing on jokes that could have been funny weren't. science fiction is ripe for parody, as spaceballs and galaxy quest proved. this movie, however, did it poorly.

dorothy stratten is the only reason to watch this unfunny sci-fi spoof, and her appearance is a disappointment. though she has the title role, her screentime is limited, and she only speaks a few lines of dialogue. if you're not a stratten fan, pass this one up.

yesterday i watched this tv production, and i was very disappointed.i didn't have big expectations when it was a tv production, but the complete movie was pain with no ending. i felt it lasted for 3 hours, but it was just me who was bored to death. every minute was a long struggle and i really fought hard to stay away from the "turn off"-switch.the movie is about a doctor (dr. verghese) who gets a lot of aids-patients, and most of them die during the movie. it is hard for verghese to live with, so his family gets punished with his frustrations. however this movie has problems showing both sides, it mostly focuses on his conversations with the patients, and sometimes we see flicks from his home, but we don't get much. the difficulties to show more than one part of verghese's life doesn't get any better with the poor acting from naveen andrews, a man i (hopefully) can't see in any good future movies.i believe it got 7,6 because of the subject (taboo?), but i'm sure that there are better movies about this subject on the market. stay away from this movie, it does not deserve more than 3/10.

is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this? there's a bunch of apes wandering about, mumbling b******, acting supposedly silly and we are supposed to laugh? there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place. even when the women finally show up, there is no sign of improvement; the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over, you might be far asleep. beware: this is not a trashy cult movie, this is trash -period! i can't believe there's even a sequel to this!1

i readily admit that i watch a lot of really bad movies. but there are very few that i can think of that are quite as bad as when women had tails. it's a stinker of epic proportions. what should have been a sexy comedy about a group of cavemen discovering a woman for the first time is instead a dull, lifeless affair without a single laugh to be had. the comedy is extremely weak. i suppose if you think bashing someone in the head is funny, you might find a laugh or two. the guys in this movie make the three stooges look like high art. and there's just not enough of a plot to hold the thing together. it seems to drag on and on and on.well, you may be asking yourself, "if it's as bad as you say, why haven't you rated it lower than a 3/10?" good question! and i've got two answers. first, the movie is not without its curiosity value. i do find a bit of interest in an italian spoof of movies like one million years b.c. with raquel welch. i'll give when women had tails a point for its historic "value". the other two points are for the mere presence of senta berger. i know it's not much of an explanation or reasoning for a rating, but what are you going to do? it's the best i can come up with.

way back at the dawn of human civilization cavemen sat around and made lame jokes, hit each other over the heads with what ever they could grab, and women were never seen and apparently at one time had tails. these cavemen lived in a geographically diverse region with a cockatoo, a camel, a monkey - but no women. this film tells of the "hilarious" misadventures of seven(or so) cavemen - having burned their land with the new discovery of fire - moving on by water to a new land where they find this woman with the extra appendage. along the way we get such "great" moments of comedy like a fat cavemen swallowing a frog that keeps croaking in his stomach. a monkey throwing rocks at their heads. a man swallowing a mouse to get the frog in his stomach. the obligatory "gay" caveman. the list could go on and on. this movie is the very definition of cinematic dreck. i was bored from the onset and it only got worse as the cavemen bobbled around hitting each other, making poor jokes such as puns on the word perch, hitting each other, and mauling poor seta berger who looks like she lost a bet to a producer to appear in this nonsense. she is indeed one of two bright spots in this film. she isn't much of an actress so you have to guess why she is an ass-et? the other "bright" spot is the music. as soon as i heard the score, i said to myself that it sounded very familiar. i had never heard the actual score but the music was unmistakably that of ennio morricone. it's a nice score and the best thing in an otherwise crude, boring, lewd, unimaginative, and ridiculous film essentially about a group of moes finding a woman for the first time and, first wanting to eat her like some animal, being taught what she could do. awwwwh! sorry, i'm stifling a yawn as i relive the plot! the end of the film has some 100 or so mostly naked women on screen with all the erotic feel of pulling a scab off your knee. this movie was painful to sit through and offers nothing of any real merit whatsoever. the fact that it spawned a sequel doesn't surprise me as it offers that one thing which will prick viewer interest - tail.

i don't really know why so many persons love this movie: maybe it's funny, ok, but it has totally ruined one of the best novels ever written. as the author himself said, this movie has betrayed the book: not only the story is violently cut to about 1/3, but all the symbols, all the complexity, everything is lost in a very 80's-fashioned fantasy/adventure film for kids. today we have effects, directors, a new attention to books: i hope that someone (tim burton, peter jackson, hayao miyazaki...) someday will direct the real neverending story. a great dead writer, a wonderful book and many literature lovers deserve it.

i saw this film before two weeks. it's kitsch, boring and totally unintelligible for people, that haven't read the original book. there are many fact mistakes too... actors plays rather poor, you must laugh even in the sad moments. it was a totally waste of time.

the girls might be prettier if you're their accompanist or a $#!+-faced onlooker. what i'm sayin' is that it'll take special circumstances for a non-whince reaction to this effort. the delivery of many lines appears to be distractingly unnatural for some actors. lighting seems to be a problem, too, although failing eyesight may have accounted for my frequent squinting. and if you view this film, be open-minded enough to accept elements that no zoo or circus would reject: they are the above and below-ground creatures who feasted on dozens of campers near an empty louisiana mansion. that's the discovery of a trio who is dispatched from their printed media to investigate the deaths. then, two of them disappear, and the survivor is part of another threesome who take up the hunt. eureka! i just realized what one of those aforementioned "special circumstances" would be - unconsciousness.

this is probably the worst film i have ever seen; it makes plan 9 from outer space look wonderful. the acting is wooden, the plot silly and the sfx non-existent. the only good thing about it is the fact that it is not a long film. the scenery is sometimes quite pretty, assuming you like trees, if that helps any!

i just finished up this unofficial adaptation of h.p. lovecraft's "the lurking fear" that was shot in louisiana. outside of a few changes (names, setting), this follows the short story point by point for the first 70 minutes but then tries to inject its own "twist" ending that you could see coming from a mile away. either way, it is a much better adaptation than full moon's the lurking fear. too bad it is a terrible film. director david mccormick shoots the thing with all the flair of an industrial short. i swear i counted maybe two camera movements. the creature design is cheap (we're talking store bought masks here) but shot in a dark manner (intentional or not) where they are somewhat creepy. the most impressive thing in the picture is the abandoned mansion but mccormick fails to exploit that as well. file this one under good adaptation, poor execution.

before i really slag this film off, i just want to say i absolutely loved it. firstly, how many times in the film did the characters use the phrase "you're right."? i'm sure i was counting in the hundreds before i gave up and started watching the film again.secondly, what the hell is with those blue monkey things? ok, so the dansen family led very private lives and had one brown eye one blue eye, but since when does that transform people into subterranean carnivorous blue zombie-creatures?and finally, 'old faithful here will protect me' hahaha :)

everything about this movie was bad, the acting was bad and the plot was bad. and were is all the blood and gore that was in "demons" which is a good movie and it was not scary at all. my brother said that this movie was bad but i had to give it a chance since the first movie was very good. when the movie was over i understand why my brother thought this movie was bad. the only plus in this movie was the music by "the smiths" and "the cult", but this is a movie and the music soundtrack is not the most important thing. and i saw that it has been released four sequels after this film, i haven't seen none of them but can they be as awful as this one, i have no plans to see them but maybe i will see them some time.

now before i tell you the synopsis this is a non-spoiler review. bone eater hits its mark for being the worst movie of the year. i don't know how these movies even get onto dvd. if i saw this in theaters i would get extremely upset. bone eater is about these people who dig up an ancient burial ground and find some bones. it's the 'bone eater' and the more bones he eats the more powerful he gets.first of all i thought okay well the dvd artwork looks creepy and it sounds creepy. when i rented it and looked at the dvd label it looked scary. but then when i played it in i could agree on one thing- the title 'bone eater' is better than the movie itself. tell me what's more stupid? a bone eater that just attacks by throwing a bone ate you and you disappear? don't worry that's not a spoiler you see that happen in the first 5 minutes. or is it more stupid that 'bone eater' has a horse? you know what i think is the stupidest? the whole movie.the cgi is awful. yeah i thought the idea of 'bone eater' was creepy but once you see the actual thing you think this is some kind of action movie or just a cruel, mean joke. the film felt longer than titanic and this was half an hour. once the film actually has its moments of suspense it just stops. i admit the acting was not the best but actually decent and that the violence wasn't over-the-top but everything else is a stinker.overall bone eater is a film you can skip. if you like interesting movies with great creatures, great cgi, and suspense 'bone eater' is a film to skip. if you like bad movies no matter how cheesy they are then 'bone eater' will satisfy.

with the exception of the fine rack on clara evans...this show was pretty bad...so why did i watch it? too much coffee, and had to relax before hitting the sack. watching bb change into his lamest big chief outfit, was amusing at best, downright laughable at worst.i could have made a better skeltor and special effects on my dell.boxlietner has seen better days, this guy is a year younger than me, and he's looking more and more like the scarecrow from his tv series days back in the early 1980....the women eye candy need to go back to acting school, although evans size 40 and playing a 17 year old(she's in her early 20s was a stretch)....the sci-fi channel has done better that this...but for us folks that don't get out to the bars much anymore, i guess we have to take what we can get...after all anything that gets you away form cnn, msnbc, and fox coverage of election 2008 these day is a good thing.

yes, thats that i felt after i completed watching this movie. the acting is below-average and the special effects are horrible. in fact, the worst i have ever seen. it is a very low budget movie. there is no way this movie will can scare you, it has no creepy or scary moments. mr. bone eater was more of a funny creature for me. it could have been much better but oh well they didn't had a big budget. the movie fails to convince you that you are watching a horror movie, lol. i would name this movie the time eater (waster). i am sure you would have a lot of better movies/etc to watch. still watch it if: 1. you have nothing else to watch. 2. you get to watch it for free. not worth renting at all.

i'm not one of those folks who bemoans everytime a film based on an old tv show comes out. rather, i usually run out and see it (if i had watched the show) and try to get nostalgic. but if anyone feels like running down films based on old shows, this is exhibit a (so you can actually say something more than just "mchale's navy"). "mod squad" is dreary, tiring, and lethargic. at least the original series was angst riddled long before anyone knew teens could be so glum, making it groundbreaking. this is just tedious. claire danes is nice to look at, but does nothing else but mood swing and sneak around spying on the baddies. giovanni ribisi's acting extent in this flick is that droopy the dog look for an hour and forty five minutes. and omar epps looks like he wants to flee the set, but the script's chlostraphobia has trapped him. sure, the production is nice, with the now seemingly obligitory "rave" nightclub opening action sequence and shootouts galore. oh, and the kids yell and get mad at each other and their superiors a lot too. it's kind of like deciding to use the scooby doo mystery machine to go on a family vacation to hollywood with your teenage kids who you and your spouse know need heavy therapy and prescription drugs. i really wanted to like this movie, and there were promising moments, but the next scene would suck the life out of it. you can knock another spelling remake, "charlie's angels", all you want, but at least that film knew it wanted to have fun with itself. "the mod squad" makes you wonder where the inspiration from the original series went.

young writers, young auteur, young cast, busload of producers, what could go wrong? everything. even lame is too good a description, that suggests that three of four legs were functioning, when actually, none of them were. barely enough recycled plotline for a 48 and a half minute television hour, gratingly stretched to ninety minutes. the audience was talking back to the screen, so bad was the story. dirty cops steal drugs from the evidence locker. how many thousands of times has this been done on television? bad cops frame good cops. again, how many times? there was not an original shred in this entire concoction. giovanni ribisi made a valiant effort to prop up the lack of script, drawing the only laughs of the entire movie. and the thought of he and claire danes working from a real script with a grown-up director and photographed by an actual cinematographer intrigues me. note to screenwriters: buy one of those story generators. it can't possibly be as bad as ripping off bad television. note to auteur: there are shots available to you other than closeups. even the lovely and interesting face of claire danes eventually grows tiresome in closeup. note to cinematographer: apprentice yourself to a professional for a few years--you have much to learn. note to color timer at the lab: at least try to persuade the auteur and the cinematographer that they don't know what they're talking about. note to claire: i hope this paid for your new condo. it's time to get some professional management and start actually reading the scripts before signing on.

i love these awful 80's summer camp movies. the best part about "party camp" is the fact that it literally has no plot. it simply drops a weak batch of "characters" into a location and then things occasionally happen. the cliches here are limitless (spoilers): the nerds vs. the jocks, the secret camera in the girls locker room, the hikers happening upon a nudist colony, the contest at the conclusion, the secretly horny camp administrators, and the embarrassingly foolish sexual innuendo littered throughout. the only cliche missing is the presence of corey feldman. this movie will make you laugh, but never intentionally. i repeat, never. a final note, be prepared to bust a gut watching the nonsense that is the "dramatic" scene where jerry riviera and d.a. share a beer late at night, spilling their guts to each other. the dialogue literally makes no sense, and the acting belongs on a high-school stage. it's a classic.

there are movies that are leaders, and movies that are followers."meatballs" was a leader. and here's one of its followers."party camp" is about as interchangeable as any of its brethern who plumbed the depths that "meatballs" (the original) had so successfully mined. of course, that one had bill murray. so, what does "party camp" have?i'm glad you asked that question.jewel sheperd has made these flicks her bread and butter, and what a side dish she provides! even as an innocent (wink, wink) girlfriend to a rich twerp (cribb), she provides that sultry steam she gives to all her parts. and yes, guys, she shows (if you know what i mean and i think you do). my gosh, that smile of hers could melt through titanium.what? oh yeah, the movie. nothing special as i said; every cheap joke is aimed for and hit (at about crotch-level). and eternal teen jayne is good for a laugh or two. but instead of a sense of humor there's just nudity, lame sex jokes, more, nudity, a soft-core dream sequence, a sex symbol nurse simply for (clothed!) leering purposes, even more nudity....hmmm... maybe it's a good idea bill murray wasn't in this.two stars. for jewel, naturally. plenty of "camp", but not much of a "party".

the worst movie i've seen in years (and i've seen a lot of movies). acting is terrible, there is no plot whatsoever, there is no point whatsoever, i felt robbed after i rented this movie. they recommended it to me mind you! a disgrace for terrible movies! stay away from this terrible piece of c**p. save your money !

i watched this movie which i really thought had a promising beginning but then it just led me to feel disappointed in the end. the problem i think with this film was that the director was trying a bit to hard to make this film weird and original. there were too many flashbacks and too many bad "effects" which got me annoyed through the film. i love debbie harry and isaac hayes but they disappointed me in this film, they could of done much better. this film seemed promising in the beginning, dragging in the middle and then disappointing in the end. the film could never beat stanley kubrick's geniousness when it comes to controversial matters, weirdness and originality in movies.

i picked this movie up because it sounded like a pretty decent flick, and i've always been a fan of foreign films. however, for someone who likes movies, i was surprised at how much i hate, hate, hated this movie.although it does aim to expose the lives of young, lowerclass men in lima, and to an extent it does succeeed, the characters are hopelessly shallow and the audience winds up having absolutely no feelings whatsoever for them.although the story chiefly revolves around m, he rarely ever speaks, and his dialouge is, at best, amazingly dry and dull.*** warning: some small spoilers ***basically, the story revolves around a young man named m who has been searching for jobs, but without success (he does gain employment twice, but quits because they're "not for him", when you're poor, the last option you have is to be picky). some amount of time is spent with his friends, who's idea of "fun" is to rape a little 14 year old, steal crappy tires off a piece of shit car for a dime sack of weed, and several other slightly retarded activities.m's friend comesup with a plan to make $25,000 a piece and move to the us by running cocaine to miami. when the drug lord gives them a job, we're treated to an extremely lame scene of the three friends buying clothes at the mall with some music playing in the background. we see them trying different clothes on like little girls given $200 to shop, get there hair cut, and then strutting off looking like slick gangsters (one character, carlos, will from this point on wear sunglasses always... even at night).the day before they leave, the leader of the group leaves to speak with the drug lord, leaving m and his friend to be dumb. they party up, take several samples of the drugs they're suppose to run, and break into thier old school, acting like animals and smashing everything in sight.the movie ends when m tries calling his girlfriend, who hangs up on him. the friends then proceed to set the pay phone on fire, which brings out a bunch of kids and some old man with gun. m and carlos' friend in charge of the drug run shows up on his motorcycle and wants them to leave with him now. then he takes off by himself, and gets shot by that old man. the police show up and arrest m and his friends (but not the man who shot the guy) and cover thier dead friend up with newspapers as music plays and it fades to credits.**** end spoiler ****i even watched this movie a second time, hoping to see some subtle, redeeming factor for it, but i did not. a complete waste of 102 minutes. although i must give it credit for being straightforward and not shying away from disturbing elements, the casting, acting, and overall direction still leaves much, much, much to be desired.imho, if you're interested in a movie that explores the issues this one was suppose to, go rent city of god (cidade de deus) instead. avoid this trash at all costs! you have been warned!!

now this is a bad movie if i've ever seen one. in one of film's greatest years, 1999, detroit rock city contends with runaway bride and wild wild west for the bottom spot in a barrel of junkies. the plot is masterful. four scrawny high school youngsters finally have their chance at seeing the hard rock theatrics of kiss forthe third year in a row. so when their tickets are toiled by an ultra-religious, chain-smoking mom, the pals scramble themselves in getting to detroit, and i'm sure you can figure out the rest.well, not exactly; the movie does go to extreme measures in explaining how the four band members (no, not gene, paul, ace and peter) go about getting these tickets: losing your virginity in a confessional; saving a smoked-out bimbo and your mom's volvo (from the soprano's steve schirripa, nonetheless); preventing a robbery in the midst of botching one for a 12-year-old's debt; and of course, stripping down to your bare essentials for mc ron jeremy after shuttling a full blender with bourbon-leftovers. sounds funny, doesn't it? perhaps detroit rock city does have a point with all this tomfoolery in how extreme sometimes these fans can go. and we do understand this movie is a comedy; it is supposed to be filled with slapstick. but does detroit rock city aim to the proper audience? it is rated r, meaning the only way prepubescent adolescents-the audience as i see it, to which many will eventually hail this one a classic-will voyeur is through illegal terms.detroit rock city also fails at giving itself the late-1970's touch. the camera's texture quality is way too clear and way too bright, missing the necessary flair from films like this is spinal tap and sid & nancy. this would've allowed audiences to feel `more at home' with the times. simply costuming kids into pre-90's grunge-wear and settling others into `disco infernos' does not do the trick. environment does mean something you know; i doubt detroit looked this glamorous in '78. if there's anything positive coming from this movie it's the kick-ass soundtrack of hard late-70 to early-80's rock. van halen, ac/dc, you name it, it's all here. of course we can't forget kiss, the band aptly subjected throughout.what the film noticeably fails to manage are questions concerning why the knights of satin's service (it's really just kiss) were so frowned upon by moms around the nation. sure, the loud rock and devilish makeup might be a part of that; encouragements for youth to explore themselves and have a good time might be fair reasons as well. but, what is kiss saying in the music we hear throughout the film towards this highly rebellious group? what separates these anthems of `rock[ing] and roll[ing] all night and partying everyday' from the rest of the music? most likely, these questions will remain in a music communication class and not in the films that should answer them, simply because it is kiss and they rock and we must do everything in our god-forgiven power to see them.1.5/5 stars

well the name in the summary should tell you everything. fred olen ray - the modern king of low budget flicks, be it for tv or direct to video (i doubt he produces for the silver screen anymore - with the death of drive-in b-movie double features and all).creator of such cult(?) classics, like hollywood chainsaw hookers and dinosaur island....well i kind of like this guys stuff. its mostly entertaining (in a distinctly cheesy, campy and especially cheap kind of way) and if he's one thing, he's a pro - something you can't say for all guys in the movie biz.but this one flick here is among the weaker ones in his oevre. insipid acting, an uninspired script and lame jokes conspire to make your brain go numb in a matter of minutes. if you are out for real f.o.r. goodness (or rather badness), look out for the above mentioned ones, and generally his stuff from the 70s and 80s (i think he lost a bit of his edge lately).

this movie made me want to bang my head against the wall. it is hard to compare such badness as this to anything, but some say that watching this movie is similar to bleeding from under your fingernails. and that comment comes from the writer's cousin. this movie was so flipping bad, it made "hulk" (the second worst movie ever) look like "the departed" (one of the greatest movies in cinematic history). if you like boring family movies with predictable plot lines, then you will absolutely love this movie. if you have a brain, then you definitely will not. when i rented this movie, i actually fell asleep while watching it. the next day, i finished it from where i left off, and it was the worst decision of my life.

when i borrowed this movie, i wasn't expecting a high-quality performance, but this was just sad.most of the acting was so unbelievably bad that you couldn't easily get into this movie if you tried. there's nothing quite like seeing a kid announce things like "oh no! my dad is invisible!" or "i wonder what this does?" in the same monotone that one might announce traffic advisories over the radio with. there are some good actors, but they are wasted on smaller parts.the story is decent, though it would be fairly easy to guess, considering that there aren't too many real plot changes. lots of holes, too. for example, the dad is invisible, and the inventor figures out what part is needed to make him visible again. so the boy goes and steals the part from an electronics store. couldn't he just ask his dad for the cash?this shows up in the comedy category, but most of the comedy in this movie was fairly dumb, like the invisible dad taking off his clothes while invisible and then almost reappearing naked during a meeting, or walking around with his head covered at all times. funny at first, but it gets old.2/5, because it is watchable, and it's one of those movies that are funny in their own way... like the monotone recitation of lines.

okay, it's a movie for children, and it's not one of those movies that adults will enjoy as well. however, there are some unintentionally funny moments, most of them involving holes in the story. for example, the kid needs a computer part to bring his dad back to normal, and he doesn't have the money. so, does he ask his father for the dough? nope, he steals it and gets caught. kids, if i'm ever turned invisible, i'll advance your allowance, ok? also, while this kid is at the police station (no doubt about to be charged with criminally lame acting), his beautiful blond teacher comes in, announces who she is and where she works, then busts the child out of the slam in front of the cops! to make matters worse, instead of making a quick getaway, they then sit in the parking lot of the police station and laugh about their achievement. you know, i hate to pick, but the kid did steal something and ought to face the consequences, but maybe being in this movie is punishment enough. y'all avoid it!

i received this movie as a birthday gift because all of my friends know i'm a big fan of low budget horror flicks. kaufman studios have always made the cheesy gory flicks that delivered. i loved to watch their films at home on rainy nights with my family...until i saw bugged...what happened?this movie started out with a pretty good concept about mutating bugs and even added some slick comedy but overall the writing is just bad and that was mistake number one. ronald k. armstrong should learn to first be a better writer before becoming a filmmaker. after reading the credits we discover he gave himself the most important role in the film!?! two words mr. director "acting lessons" ok? mr. armstrong joins the ranks of other writer/directors who cast themselves in their own movies and that's mistake number two. the only thing that i believed saved this film was the artistic camera work and the musical score, (let's hear it for the crew!) the cast of other actors who in the beginning of this production seemed a bit cold, really warmed up toward the middle and end of this production. everyone pulled together and helped to pull this film off. ronald armstrong may lack the talent to ever become a decent director or actor but, i'll say this of him-he seems to know how to organize people to get them all to come together and pull his productions off.this film, i have to say can be an inspiration to any young filmmaker who dreams of making their own movie because if mr. armstrong was able to pull this off, any one else can too. if you get a chance to see this film, watch it for the sake of getting inspired to do "better" in the future. hollywood needs bigger and better horror flicks to keep this genre coming back from it's grave.

big spoiler right here: this film is b!a!d! but enjoy, it's good bad.bugged is the kind of film you can't believe exists, with dialog, plotting, and direction so ineptly handled that uncle ned's carlsbad cavern home video looks like an imax experience. since it's a troma flick, there's plenty of gross-out gore on tap, but its even sillier than usual.most of the production money seems to have gone into buying soda and sandwiches for cast and crew. the brilliant dialog is best summed up in the immortal, "%@#$! what was that?" which is second only to the oft screamed, "now what?"any knowledge of how people act in a desperate situation is alien to ronald armstrong, the writer/director. when one of the friends is found being eaten alive by a grasshopper/termite/chiapet thing, armstrong has the survivors immediately making time with cute, but dumb-as-a-doorknob, "divine." while she's being hit on, divine is cooking up a big steaming pot of a rat-poison/oatmeal mixture on the stove, stirring, smiling, stirring, smiling, never falling over dead from the fumes!the killer bugs are as frightening as piñatas, which they too closely resemble. the effects used to move them include dragging them across tile floors real fast with their legs dragging behind.the highlight for the film would probably have been the house blowing up, but they were either out of cash or never had any, so instead of seeing even a miniature go up in flames, they simply let the screen go black (eat you heart out ilm).the cast is virtually all black. how can the naacp consistently censor something truly funny like amos and andy (which depicts characters certainly no less similiar than those on 99% of all white comedy shows), but says nary a peep about something like bugged. oh well, it's best they don't know about how demeaning this film is to all involved (as it would be if it were played by any single ethnic group, frankly). before they put the kabosh on bugged, get some friends together and get ready for the plan 9 of bug exterminator movies.

in what attempts to be a positive story, dolph lundgren leads a group of mercenaries to take over a tropical island that looks a lot like paradise so that the men who hired his team can mine it for...bird droppings. actually, the nitrogen gas that exudes from the muck on this island is what they are after.there was only one good thing about this movie -- the island location in which it was filmed was beautiful. otherwise, the story drowns itself leaving the actors with nothing to work with. result: a lot of violence, a lot of language, lots of blood, and a few shots of women topless. if you want pointless violence (sorry, the storyline can't even give the violence a point, though it tries) then this is the movie for you.parents: be warned that this movie is full of violence and blood, driving the r rating.

about the movie itself, there are ample comments. i just wanted to say something about the german version, which i have seen recently on tv. it is heavily cut. from 103 to 76 minutes! it is usual that the most bloody scenes are cut for german tv. i understand the reasons for that, but this movie was something else. they did not only cut "gore-shots" - they have cut entire sequences, sparing only glimpses. like: "we have to attack them" - one 5 second shot of explosions in the camp - protagonist running away.when the assault on the island begins, it isn't even possible anymore to follow the storyline. all the cuts create something that amounts to a string of erratic, disconnected scenes that don't make any sense anymore.i could not stand to watch the end after spending 60 minutes on this nonsense.i think i would have given the original 7/10 the german version is worth only 1/10get it on dvd (and check the runtime first) or forget about it.

i rented this movie because it supposedly takes place in a jazz club -- you know, those hip, cool places you might stumble upon late on a saturday night. well, there's not one ounce of "cool" in this ridiculous movie. the score is goofy, the original songs are awful, both lead actors' singing is continually off-key (to be kind) and unprofessional at best, the plot is no more complex than "boy meets girl," the acting is laughable, and the only decent cinematic moments are the stock footage scenes. the jazz club scenes feature sophomoric dialog smothered by overly-busy organ music. this joey de francesco should keep his day job (unless his day job is helping with movie scores). is it possible to not only get my four dollars back, but have my therapy sessions paid for as well? this movie, interestingly enough, is so bad, you might want to watch it. sort of like driving by a bad accident -- you just have to look at least once. just get the ear plugs ready!

by the time the hellraiser franchise was reaching it's forth film the premise was wearing a bit thin. dr. paul merchant (bruce ramsey) is a scientist in the future, whom while prisoner regales his captor of the story of how his ancestors (all played by ramsey) had first built the evil lament configuration puzzle-box that sets evil upon the world and how his bloodline had subsequent dealing with said box. the film is a awash with lack of continuity in regards to the other films and lack of coherency in this one. yes, this could be due to a combination of rewrites, massive cuts in the original version of the film, or what have you. but i'm reviewing the film as is, and not what it was or could have been. and as it is now it's a mess. sure the franchise will go on indefinitely with direct to dvd sequels, but this one was pretty much a death-nail to it's chances of getting a new one released theatrically ever again.my grade: d-

after the failure of "hellraiser iii: hell on earth," the chapter that served as a kind of 'death blow' to the franchise, another embarrassing cheapo cash-in did not come as a surprise. an abysmal attempt to explain every single mystery of pinhead and the puzzle box, covering literally centuries of history, in a film that runs under 90 minutes... on display is sub-par to wretched acting, sup-par to wretched b-movie special effects, and a ludicrous and insulting attempt at dark humour, while still attempting to keep the whole project completely serious. i'm wondering, how many freaking directors did this thing have? poor pinhead has so much screen time, that every bit of mystery and menace that this iconic character possessed, is completely lost. after an hour of hearing long-winded speeches and dramatic posturing, we simply want to tell the guy to shut up! mildly entertaining in spots, especially in the first segment, this mess begins to look and feel like a cheap, ugly made for tv splatter flick after a while, and ends in the most ridiculous way imaginable: pinhead, along with his pet cenobite dog, killing a bunch of idiots... in outer space! i'm sorry, but any true fan of the first two films in the series, that gave this abortion of a film more than 3 stars, should be ashamed. on a side note, the film that follows; "hellraiser: inferno" is actually a surprisingly intelligent, and stylishly-made film-noir piece, that brilliantly reinstates 'pinhead' as a master of illusion and cruelty, and brings back the concept of the inherent evil in human kind, that was the centerpiece of the original film, and the whole point of the story. for any serious horror fan, see hellraiser i & ii, skip the lousy iii & this one, and continue with 'inferno.' you won't miss a thing by skipping this garbage...

the joe cool review - hellraiser: bloodlinestarring: bruce ramsay as phillip l'merchant/john merchant/dr. paul merchant, valentina vargas as angelique and doug bradley as pinheadplot: this follows a timeline of the lineage of the merchant bloodline, which started with phillip l'merchant, who created the box that opens the doorway to hell. starting with the 18th century to present time when pinhead first meets merchant and tries to sever the bloodline..(he's the only one who can stop pinhead, you see) and finally in the future, in space, where paul merchant has finally figured out how to send pinhead to hell for good.openers: this is a movie hated so much by the people who made it, they declared fictional director alan smithee would be the credited director. they only pull smithee out of the woodwork when they really think they've made a terrible movie, such as classics as the birds ii: land's end or bloodsucking pharaohs in pittsburgh. no i didn't make that up. how did i like it? you're reading this so i'm sure that's what you want to know.the good: this movie isn't as bad as you've been led to believe. oh i'm not going to sugar-coat it. this movie was filled with so much potential and ended up being a disaster, but it does have some positives. cooler cenobites this time around for starters, such as the twins and the demon angelique. pinhead is still in a main role, and still has good lines("pain has a face, allow me to show it to you") and it's somewhat entertaining throughout. gorehounds will love the movie because of it's endless supply. there is also some continuity with the rest of the series, although you'll have to look hard to see it. the chatterer dog is awesome.the bad: but for a story about hell vs the cursed merchant bloodline that could close the gateway forever, it was really complicated and held together with duct tape. nothing was really explored to it's full potential and there were some really stupid things included. pinhead kidnaps a kid and holds him for ransom! random deaths just to feature more blood(not always a bad thing, but not for the sake of the story). pinhead is at his worst here, he rants and rants and rants even when he's about to die! for the very smart demon that he used to be, he's been reduced to nothing more than a bond villain, at best. if hellraiser fans ever needed a reason why he was moved back into a cameo like role, this is it. bloodline ruined it for us all.the ugly: gore is always mentioned here. this one has skin ripping, drilling, hook impaling, beheadings, and more goodies. the chatterer dog, while awesome, reeks of bad special effects during the chase scenes.final verdict: this movie had the potential for something great, even hellbound levels of greatness. but all of that was wasted. who knows exactly what went down to produce this crap, but we can only blame alan smithee.compared to the rest: this movie is the worst of the hellraiser series. for completists only.rating: 1/2* of *****

rarely seen a movie that deviates so much from the original premise and still remains (more or less) acceptablebloodline is a rather short (which is a good thing in this case) escapade that focuses on the mysterious hellraiser box. who wanted it to be made and how it cast a spell on the entire bloodline of the man who eventually created it. we're introduced to 3 generations of the merchant family (all played by bruce ramsey); one in 18th century paris, one in the present day and the last one in a future galaxy far, far away opinions on this storyline may differ a loteither you think it's very idiotic and far-fetched ororiginal and dared. the initial atmosphere and setting by clive barker has completely vanished, yet the morbid surrounding remains and several sequences are still very creepy and unsettling. hellraiser: bloodline contains quite a lot of exquisite slaughtering and the charismatic presence of pinhead (doug bradley) still is an extra horror-value. pinhead  accompanied by a pet puppy this time  still knows how to killtoo bad he talks too much and his vicious speeches tend to get boring quickly. best aspects in this production are the newly introduced `cenobites' and the occult parisian portrait. giant turn-offs are the weak script, the absence of the typical macabre humor and the lack of references to barker's initial masterpiece. although not highly memorable itself, bloodline stands as the last watchable hellraiser film. after this sequel, the series went downhill completely. so far, 2 more sequels came out (2 more are still in process) and neither of those is worth seeing. hellraiser:bloodline suffered from a lot of production difficulties and the director eventually preferred to be credited as alan smitheemeaning he doesn't want to be remembered as the director of it. who could blame him?

never mind the serious logic gaps, never mind the achingly cliche character portrayals, never mind the haphazard writing, and you might like this movie. the main character alyssa was supposed to be endearing, the heroine who you root for to be saved,(or in this case, save herself) but instead she merely grates, and makes one wonder, are all pro ballerinas really that stupid? her busybody mother was obviously only necessary to further propagate the illusion that ballet companies are evil monsters ready to snatch your poor, innocent, young girl from your grasp, with an ever present, biting artistic director/villain. and the cliche's! not only does she become anorexic, bulemic, an over the counter junkie, and a pathological liar, but all in the course of a few months. it's like the writer read every horror story he could dig up about ballet and decided to see how much he could cram into two hours, (with commercials).believe it or not, but i am a dancer. this "uprising" or "resurgence" of anorexia and bulemia that is happening is nonexistent at all of the dance schools i have attended. in fact, the teachers are so scared to even suggest that a girl might stand a better chance a few pounds lighter, most of the dancers in my classes would be actually considered minorly overweight. i'm not saying eating disorders never occur, but not to the extent as it was portrayed in the movie.another annoying problem this movie had was the means-to-an-end writing style. her on again off again boyfriend probably had all of half an hour total screen time, all in the first half. the other supporting characters were merely props, decorations to further the story. given the right dialogue, this would have been a very intricate mind study of a psycological problem. as it is, it turns into a one woman show, and kimberly mccullough doesn't have the chutzpah to pull it off.to a non dancer, this movie would be a supposed "insight" into what really goes one behind closed doors at a ballet company. to a dancer, this is a very insulting movie, which portrays ballerinas as stupid and parents as pushy and ill informed. those adjectives more correctly describe the people who got this on the air in the first place. 3/10

i just purchased this movie because i love to donate to operation smile, the charity on which the movie was based...but i found the writing of the movie to be very strange. it t does not really focus so much on operation smile or similar organizations like the smile train and their herculean efforts to relieve the suffering of children born with facial deformities in third world countries. no, it concentrates on an american teenage volunteer, katie, whose "over-privileged" life in malibu, california, includes a mother who brings her to a doctor so that she'll have birth control pills in her before she sleeps with her boyfriend. what is this birth control nonsense supposed to do, titillate the audience? it's 2005. i'd be more surprised if in 2005 a malibu teen wasn't on birth control, and even if she is, so what and who cares? contrasting katie is the character of lin in china, a girl with a facial deformity who missed last year's chance to get an operation and this year does not want to have one. neither character is written in such a way that the audience can really identify with, let alone understand the motivations of, either girl. on the other hand, the actors do an adequate job of trying to play the bad hand they were dealt by whoever wrote this ridiculous script. the best performance was by the gentleman playing lin's father although much of his dialogue is in chinese and subtitled. operation smile deserved to be honored by a much better movie than this!

not to be confused with michael ritchie's nasty 1975 beauty pageant spoof, this "smile" is a down-turned example of those good intentions paving the road to hell.the film parallels two stories: an impoverished chinese father sacrifices his wife and son to raise a facially-deformed orphan named ling (yi ding), and a tv-spawned malibu family act out "gidget get birth control." katie (mika booram, the third olsen twin) plays a spoiled, self-absorbed high schooler distanced from reality. her teacher (sean astin) paves the way for a school trip to china aimed at showing students how to work with deformed children.the film uses deformity as a means of suspense by treating ling like the frankenstein monster. kramer continually masks her deformity through hats, hoods and camera placement. this approach exploits the freak show quality inherent in the material. she may be uncomfortable with the way society views her and kramer's answer is to cover her up until the big reveal. why disturb your audience with such unpleasantness? we see her face briefly at the end and only minutes before closing-credit snapshots of her after surgery disclose a swan beneath the harelip. it is not good enough to give the girl a reason to live; what is imperative is ling being equally as hot and popular as katie.funding for the film came from a trust established by the late roy rogers and dale evans. they envisioned a heritage of quality family films. give me "son of paleface" any day.

this movie is terrible, it was so difficult to believe that katie became a heartfelt teenager with the power to save the pity chinese people, the movie didn't show any convincing argument to prove that. and the rest of the plot didn't make any effort to show us more than a cheap common sense... the plot is ridiculous and the only thing we can extract from it is that it demonstrate how arrogant a human can be. katie must have inherited her arrogance from her mother, the most annoying character i have seen for a long time. the acting and scenery were ok, but the plot ruins everything, full of cheap clichés and hypocritical scenes, i expect not to see this movie again in my life. skip this one!

i can't help but forget that incredible scene in alien, when the extra terrestrial burst out of one of the men's chest. or even in predator when the invisible monster snuck upon the bewildered soldiers and cut them to pieces. both these movies expressed fascinating ideas on the run-of-the-mill creature feature. back track to the era of cheesy b-movies and watch big men in phony suits parading around killing people in small towns. now recognize that the two movies above revolutionized this genre. the cave does nothing to improve on it. it tries nothing new, and worst of all, the cave doesn't even have good gore. shame on them, shame on them all. parading around in sexy spandex are the one-dimensional characters of the cave. all of which seem to not care when they witness the death of their colleagues. they just stroll along, unbeknownst to the evil creature lurking in the darkness. the plot is very easy to understand. so you got the two brothers, the black guy and the sexy female scientist. the rest (by the rest i mean all of those meet grisly demises) are even more unexciting then the others. we have the korean assistant, the risky outdoor chick, a russian scientist and two divers, both lacking a sense of emotion and are stupid enough to wander off by themselves. this movie exceeds to be extremely clichéd, since everybody but the black guy, one of the brothers and the female scientist meet an end. it also seems only americans can survive the terror, since the russian and the korean die. don't be offended if i give away details. there's no real surprise anyway.to be straight forward they find this cave. they go in the cave. they get stuck in the cave. they start dying in the cave. one of them gets infected in the cave. more die in the cave. they get out of the cave; only to discover that one of them has a parasite that will turn them into a ghastly monster, which really doesn't seem to bother them. that's the simplicity of the lackluster plot. it doesn't even try to be original. it even has the part where they decide their leader isn't capable and split up. we have just seen this way to many times before.i know in a movie like this, people don't care about the performances but it's worth mentioning how bad they were. everyone is just so dreary. cole hauser was especially unsophisticated and don't get me started on eddie cibrian, who is frequently a lot better. morris chestnut is hands down the best thing in the movie. his performance is actually decent. he portrays the guy who calms everybody down. all the other actors are average at best. in a show like this, that's really not a bad thing.now to the reason we go to this genre of film; the action, of course. well, to my regret, the action was dull. the death scenes are all boring, hell the whole movie was. there is barely any blood at all. it's either they disappear and found later or they are attack and die without a bruise. seeing the koreans man's death was the only exciting action i could find. it's pretty amazing. the bad things over shadow most of the things that are good. a good example is to say the special effects were well done, which they were. the only thing wrong is that since everything takes place in a cave, it's going to be dark. i found it extremely hard to distinguish between the cave walls and the monsters. so it was pretty hard to even see the creatures. although i liked the special effects, there was nothing original about the monsters. they all resembled each other and they weren't frightening at all.the cave marks the directorial debut for bruce hunt. i don't see what he was trying to accomplish by making this film. he obviously made a huge mistake. almost everything about this movie stunk like a stink bomb. a stink bomb is probably even more pleasurable than watching this mess again. only the most forgiving moviegoer will find this forgivable. i gave up all hope in the middle of the film when i heard the phrase "what the hell was that", for the third time.

"the cave" got released more or less simultaneously with the english film "the descent", directed by neil marshall. both movies share a similar premise; only "the cave" is dreadfully unoriginal, unexciting and incompetent compared to the splendid horror adventure that is "the descent". it feels like neil marshall realized that the basic story was too poor and instantly added ingenious ideas, depth and a personalized style, whereas "the cave"-director bruce hunt simply went for the most rudimentary elaboration of the screenplay that was thrown on his desk. the result is an unbelievably mediocre film that features every single horror cliché you can think of and in which most of the violence happens off-screen. and we all hate that, don't we? the story introduces a clique of insufferable cave-divers that become trapped in a completely undiscovered romanian underground ecosystem. hideous winged creatures, that also happen to be parasites, soon attack them and escape seems impossible due to a landslide. the first half hour is still mildly entertaining if you keep yourself busy with spotting all the clichés and listening to the cheesy textbook dialogs, but the whole thing just gets too dire. none of the events are even slightly plausible and it looks like the entire cast is competing with each other to deliver the worst performance. i've seen better special effects in anonymous b-movies already, the filming locations aren't used to the fullest and the ending downright sucks! very much not recommended!

some sciencey people go down in a cave for some reason and there's some sort of creature that's killing them.i usually give a more detailed plot, but i wasn't paying too much attention to this. overall, it was dull and the only time you'll be really paying attention is during the action scenes, which the director did wonderful on.the acting is alright, but the characters are so dull and forgettable they blend in your mind. you'll forget who lived and who died for 2 reasons: 1. the kills are boring 2. the characters are boring.the ending might have shocked me more if i knew who was who.so you're looking for a creatures-in-cave movie? check out the descent instead.

its perhaps unfair of me to comment on this film , because , for the first time ever , i switched off a movie because it was so bad. i can watch anything , but this movie was so very boring. i was bored before i put on the dvd and thought this might be a laughable action horror/ action movie to lighten the mood. it is not even that , it is a device which increases the level of boredom by the power of 100. had to switch it off after 45 minutes because all that had happened in that time was some people had been scuba diving , and a big mole had been discovered. seriously , this movie is not worth the time, even if you can enjoy a bad movie like i can , avoid this film like the plague.worst thing i have seen in years.

dire! dismal! awful! laughable! disappointing!right, your trapped in "the cave" with several "hard" men and a woman or two, your being systematically killed by "something" and you still don't get to hear any naughty grown up words!!! a 15 cert' here in england, and you could tell!the egos of the "macho men" was just too much, pass the bucket i'm going to be sick.this movie should never be exposed to daylight and ironically, be kept in the darkest, deepest hole in the ground and be forgotten forever. i have a feeling that this description isn't the first time to pop its his head from a hole in the ground.just like the film the cube, it looked like a good concept but was just let down at the last post by, well its self.this comment contains spoilers alright, its called the cave.thanks bruce.

the mission to see the movie "the cave" was a dream of a friend of mine after witnessing the highly dramatic trailer, full of flashes of a creature lurking in a cave, some young cave divers, and not much else. it's too bad that the movie didn't change much more than the trailer did.the immediate allure of a movie like this is the creature. what's he going to look like? why does he live in a cave? how is this one supposed to be different from the other creatures we've been shown in movies like alien and predator and the relic? the cave "demons" do not look far from the skeletal creature in alien: resurrection and even has the sight of predator. shame that's a total ripoff...well, let's look at the plot: very confusing and jumps to more and more totally improbable twists as a team of cave divers is sent to find a cave and its dwellers in the carpathian mountains. the casting was very much clear that we want young, hip, tough chicks, chiseled guys, and the girls who have brains also have to be hot. we also have to have one of every racial background in case the audience thinks that the film-makers are biased to a certain viewpoint. totally been done, and i'm totally tired of it.the other main problem was the ending, as if to say there might be a sequel. plase shoot me if there is one. the tagged on ending made me wretch.i gave this movie 3/10 stars. the points that it did get were more or less appreciation points towards the creature-builders for their high-quality job spent on the costuming and design for the monsters who dwell within, even when they looked totally ripped off. and there's an interesting (yet labored) documentary on the dvd on underwater cave diving. go check it out only if you love new creations of monsters and creatures, but be warned that you've probably seen this movie before, and it was better the first time.

because that's what hell ride pretty much is. larry bishop and tarantino partying on the weinstein's money with the promise to deliver a movie sometime down the line. i'm all for fake boobage and booze as much as the next guy but did we really need the movie? really there's nothing worse than the reheated second-hand leftovers of an old trend. and i'm not even talking about 70's grindhouse cinema because hell ride has none of the raw and unpolished feel of the era it purports to pay homage to. no, this is slick and glossy mtv hollywood through and through. the old trend i'm talking about is the self-consciously pseudo-hip quirky cinematic world where tarantino meets guy ritchie and robert rodriguez. all three guys were at least talented and found success for a reason. hell ride is just a second-hand copy, fickle and uninspired, polished to the max when it should be raw, the "supercool" aspect coming off forced and silly.there's no reason for example why such a simple and utterly inane story has to be told in convoluted, back-and-forth in time fashion. it's just a post-tarantino quirk. there's also no reason why the dialogues have to be so mind-numbingly pointless, people flapping their gums while saying nothing: at least when travolta was talking about cheeseburgers in pulp fiction it felt fresh. dialogues here amount to little more than pseudo-macho posturing. there's also no reason why a grating rock'n'roll guitar has to twangle aimlessly over the entire movie. perhaps the lowest hell ride hits is when it tries to be quasi-existential. there's a hilarious dream/illusion scene in the desert where bishop eats peyote and sees colours. i was half-expecting an old indian to come out and offer nuggets of wisdom.the only saving grace of this abysmal turd is the boobage and vinnie jones' monologue about his wings tattooes (and maybe some of the desert exterior shots). lots of boobage and hot scantily clad babes. now that's something i can get behind but a movie they don't make. everything else is just an empty shell, an imitation of other infinitely more talented imitators.

tarentino should be ashamed to be involved with this awful film. the acting, directing and script are all third-rate - with the entire film playing out like an excuse for writer/director/star larry bishop to get laid. the only reason it was made at all is most likely due to his association with qt. the plot of the film is pretty flimsy, and basically tries to survive on not-so-obscure references to older b-movies and some cameos from guys like david carradine, dennis hopper, and vinnie jones. each one is listless in their performance, particularly hopper who is in full-on paycheck mode at this point in his career. the saving grace, if there is one, is that the script is so laughably bad that it can be entertaining. bishop tries so hard to get that trademark tarentino banter and just fails miserably, which can be pretty humorous at times and grating at others. i'd only check this one out if you love bad movies...or if you're really into biker films.

or that's what the filmmakers would like you to believe, anyway.this movie tries sooo hard to be cool it's ridiculous. everything, from the look of the film, the cinematography, the editing, the dialogue and the acting, is geared in super cool mode from the get go. just to make sure that no one misses how cool this film is, there's a soundtrack of really cool rock n roll tunes and a twangy western-surf-tex mex guitar playing constantly throughout the film. as a final reminder of how frickin cool this movie is, all the actors have been instructed to speak in a hoarse voice, because, as we all know, that's badass.the plot (if there indeed is one) seems pretty straightforward. but as someone else already pointed out, the director and star of the film, seems fiercely determined not to tell that story, instead focusing on a plethora of naked babes and dialogue that's supposed to be badass, but grows tired surprisingly quick (did they have an contest to see how many times they could cram the words "pussy" and "f*ck" and its derivatives in an 80 minute film?).this movie was absolutely horrible.

quentin tarantino once said that to succeed in the film industry you had to make your own pulp fiction or reservoir dogs. writer/actor/director larry bishop seems to have taken that advice a little too literally with hell ride and concocted a messy homage that borrows much too heavily in its visuals, music, camera-work, and time-altering storytelling. but to properly mimic a tarantino film, one has to have a knack for constructing creative conversations; unfortunately hell ride's primary derailing element is its atrocious ramblings and vulgar monologues that only work to disgust and confuse the audience while simultaneously invoking pity for the actors just for being involved.the anti-hero protagonist biker gang, the victors, consists of several weathered vigilantes who bring their own brand of bloodthirsty justice to the lawless roads. the leader, pistolero (larry bishop), is hell-bent on revenge and putting out fires. the gent (michael madsen) just tries to balance his chaotic, psychotic symphony of life with putting lead into anyone who crosses his boss, and comanche (eric balfour) follows with a fierce loyalty and a mysterious past.on the villainous front, deuce (david carradine) is the mastermind who orchestrates from afar, though not quite far enough, and billy wings (vinnie jones) spits venom and lewd explanations for his tattoos while toting a harpoon gun and a general disdain for life. while these characters might sound interesting on paper, once they're forced to rant horrendously ill-conceived dialogue all traces of cool disappear faster than the funding should for bishop's next film.while hell ride is riddled with imperfections and missed opportunities, the main facet of its undoing lies in the poorly devised conversations. and because bishop's main influences are the talky films of tarantino, there are a lot of them. the first twenty minutes of the movie are nearly unintelligible and would probably make as much sense muted. by the time pistolero's main squeeze is introduced and certain phrases are overused to the point of nausea, you'll pray for both death and the ability to turn the sound off. even dennis hopper has trouble remaining cool while spouting off such goofy dialogue.have you ever repeated a word or phrase to yourself so many times that it just doesn't sound right or even make sense anymore? bishop starts there and then keeps the madness going until you envy the characters on screen getting their heads cut off. and when the dialogue finally takes a break, we're treated to interspersed shots of nude female oil wrestling and throats being slashed. i'm not sure what effect bishop hoped to attain, but i doubt he found it.hell ride wants to pay homage to quentin tarantino films, robert rodriguez films, and every movie that idolizes the violent and devil-may-care attitudes of bikers. but while its intentions may be noble, the horrendously cringe-worthy dialogue and the hyper-stylized timeline-mangling editing prevents the audience from becoming invested with the generic tough-guy characters. by the time we figure out the mystery behind the characters' motives (and it may be awhile before you even realize there's a mystery to be solved), it's just too hard to care anymore. and while everyone on screen is clearly having fun, they've entirely neglected to translate any of that entertainment to the audience.- joel massie

definitely the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life. i can't find anything positive to say about this movie (if this production is even worthy of that word). this production is not even the standard of a low budget porn-movie!my question is simply: why did someone look at the script and think "hey i'm gonna make a movie out of this"?at the end of the movie i wasn't even hoping that "nicole" was going to make it. she was really that annoying!so for your own sake, do not watch this movie... unless you want to waste 85 minutes of your life...

first of all, just let me say this... ghost story....hello!?!if any of the other people who trashed this movie from beginning to end realized this fact, their reviews would have been very different. the fact that characters kept disappearing whenever the protagonist turned back to look, should have been a dead giveaway. this movie was not billed as a ghost story when you went to rent it in the video store, not even a hint, and that is the biggest mistake that was made by the studio who marketed it. it was deliberate on their part not to market it as a ghost story in order to confuse you like the main character is confused as you try to make sense of it. the problem in this is that they lost too many viewers; the ghosts appeared "too human and real" without any of the usual telltale signs, imagery or special effects that hollywood usually uses to let you know you are now seeing a ghost...and that, is what they were trying to do. the main character does not know she is seeing ghosts and neither does the viewer. now do you get it? as long as you understand that the main character is seeing ghosts, then you'll understand the movie and not be so irritated by what is perceived as major oversights in continuity or plot flaws.i admit, this being said, it still was not a good movie, just not as bad a just about everyone else made it out to be. just understand, if you plan on watching this movie, everything you see, "ain't" always what what you think it is. 4 out of 10 for acting, 3 for originality, 5 for plot and 5 for scare factor, though there was some gore and spooky moments. still not a good movie, just way misunderstood.

under no circumstances watch this film. it is terrible for a number of reasons:no plot no structure no direction no acting to speak of no visual style no tensionin a word - no.best thing about it the box and the fact it eventually ends. who would have thought 85mins could feel so long.once again: under no circumstances watch this film. it is terrible.no plot no structure no direction no acting to speak of no visual style no tensionin a word - no.best thing about it the box and the fact it eventually ends. who would have thought 85mins could feel so long.

continuing in the string of "stalker/slasher" flicks in the vein of "wolf creek," "hostel," "joy ride," etc., comes "rest stop." the most unoriginal and useless one of them all.we start, reasonably promising, with the violent death of a pretty young girl in a filthy restroom.this is where our interest is lost. we, then, move to the cliché road trip couple, on their way to la with their eyes on acting stardom. . . which, doing movies like this, they'll never achieve.from the sexual romp in the park, the couple drives, arguing all the way, to a deserted and disgusting rest area for the girl to use the bathroom. harmless enough until she exits and finds her boyfriend missing and realizes she's being stalked by a lame version of "joy ride"'s rusty nail. . . only driving around in mater from "cars".honestly, if this had been directed/written/produced/acted by anyone else, it might've been fairly good. but no.because then comes the ghost story. yup. . . you guessed it. plenty of "oh, i'll help you, but wait, you're dead" to "wait is this stalker a person, monster, or ghost?".but wait? who comes to the rescue to save the girl's life and possibly the movie? that one lawerence brother. excellent. we're saved. (sarcasm) oh wait, no we're not.you know. . . if you want to laugh off a pretty bad, or if you get free rentals like i do, give it a try.if anything, you'll learn how not to make a movie.-ap3-

obviously raw feed video is smarter than all of us who wasted our money renting this flick! they will make millions from video rentals and their low budget investment is going to pay off big, which will finance "rest stop ii" (unfortunately). i figure they spent a maximum of a few hundred thousand dollars american to hire the actors, rent the rest stop locale and burn a truck and drag a motorcycle along behind the truck for a bit plus pay for the technical stuff. that's it. we should all be as smart as these guys, i won't knock them for having the genius to promote a stinker into good monetary returns. premise of the movie was good, and it could have been a really adequate horror movie, but it failed by not delivering a clear story line. i am always looking for a gem from the upstart film companies, but i didn't find it here and neither will you. i'm only sorry i wasted $3.99 plus tax to find out.

seriously, folks...i was getting ready to actually write the razzie council and recommend this movie as razzie champ for 2007...until i got on imdb.com and realized its copyright date was 2006 and not 2007. seriously, though, this movie could have easily been a razzie champ. this movie sucked! how in the world this piece of crap was overlooked even for a razzie nomination in 2006 is beyond me, because it easily could have competed with basically, it stinks, too for the 2006 razzie championship.i rented this movie on the recommendation of a female neighbor of mine who told me, "oh my god, after seeing this movie, it's going to be a long, long time before i ever stop at a rest stop ever again!" i couldn't believe how not scary and awful this movie was! possible spoilers below, not that you'll be missing out on anything.ok, first of all...the problem...the rest stop itself. obviously the director of this piece of crap doesn't know the first thing about women. the toilets in that rest stop were on the same level as the one in the movie trainspotting. i don't claim to know everything there is to know about women, but one thing i do know is that women, for the most part, are total and complete hygiene/neat freaks. given the choice between taking a crap on either of those toilets and possibly catching something or squatting in the woods, a woman is going to opt for squatting in the woods. i know, because i've gone camping with them before, and they have no problem squatting in the woods. so right there...major plot hole and untruth.second of all...she comes out of the rest stop, and her boyfriend who drove the car is nowhere to be found, not him nor his car. he just left. she starts screaming his name, wondering where he is. ummm...hello? you're standing on wet mud...did it ever occur to you to look down for some tire tracks? i mean, his car is gone...it didn't just get up and fly away. and actually, that makes me think...i actually was looking down at her feet, and there weren't any tread marks in the mud. how...exactly...did that happen?third...the bible thumping mobile home family with the freak midget in the back taking polaroid pictures...wtf!?!?!?? they made absolutely no sense at all, and it's as if the director just threw them in to be weird for the sake of being weird. they made no sense at all and had no place even being in the movie.fourth...oh my god, this...i mean, finally...near the end of the movie...she finally sees the escape hatch on the ceiling inside the rest stop. i'm like, "you...dumb...bi**h. you've been locked up in this rest stop for all this time...and you just..now...see...the escape hatch on the ceiling?" i mean...it's like they threw that in just because the killer tossed gasoline on the floor through the window and was getting ready to light a match. so she needs to get to higher ground to avoid being burned, and...oh, look! a perfect reason for her to get to higher ground! an escape hatch on the ceiling! it's like...why didn't she go through that before? most people in that situation would have seen that from the moment they were locked in that rest stop and gotten the f**k out of dodge. when they showed that escape hatch at the end of the movie, i was like, "you have got to be kidding me."fifth...what was the deal with all the of people she encountered continuing to just disappear? the girl in the broom closet in the rest stop? the dumb cop? her at the end of the movie when she ended up in the broom closet herself? it was never explained. personally, when they did this, i thought to myself, "oh, christ on a cracker, it's her. she's the killer. wonderful. she killed all of those people, doesn't remember doing it, and the writers of this movie just ripped off a certain french horror flick that i can't mention on imdb.com or i'll be blacklisted for giving away the ending (that movie sucked, by the way, too, people)." but it wasn't. she wasn't the killer, and the whole deal with the dead people disappearing was never, ever explained. oh, for the love of god, people, stay away from this movie! this movie sucked balls, and i have now got a serious bone to pick with my neighbor. it's on the 2 for $1 rack at family video, don't even rent it if someone gives it to you for free!

i have seen a lot of movies. in fact i love b horror movies, they are one of my favorite genres. however this "garbage" (i refuse to acknowledge that this was given the honor of film) was the worst piece of crap i have ever had the torture of watching. i actually signed up on imdb purely for the fact that i needed a way to at least voice how awful this "garbage" was. i have watched "films" (they at least deserve the honor) done in basements by high school students that were better written and directed. i have nothing but pity for the poor actors in this "garbage" because they were just trying to earn a pay check. they will now and forever have this stain on their records like a virgin who was raped and given herpes! if writer/director john shiban has any dignity left at all, after obviously fellating countless people to get this made, he should never allow himself near a camera again and try applying his so called "gifts" to something more suited for him....like mopping the floor of a peep show!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

the only good thing about this movie is, that i now have a movie on the worst ever list. rest stop being on the end of the spectrum where i can compare all terrible movies to. really, this movie is the worst plot, worst directed, throughout the whole movie all i wanted to do is pull out my hair and kick the writer's and anybody who made this movie possible's ass. i am a deployed soldier, and when i spend my precious downtime watching movies like this. these people should feel terrible, they had to of watch this before it came out, and must have been to freaking lazy to redo , after they noticed it freaking sucked. i am so amazed that this great country of ours is letting them make another. honestly, this is the first time i have ever commented on a movie, i had to let the world know, not to waste their time. delete this movie from the face of this planet. it makes us humans look retarded.

i cant put it any simpler than that, this is a terrible film. i've worked in the industry and made several (short) films myself, so okay my standard is pretty high but seriously, i absolutely hate this film. i haven't made a comment on imdb before but i hated this film so much i literally had to come and warn others. it is a piece of sh*t. the writer/director is an idiot who just has no idea how to make/write a good film and has the writing skills of an adolescent teenager. the characters are unrealistic (the lead woman doesn't think of taking the policeman's pistol yet is resourceful enough to improvise a molotov cocktail? please...) and not even likable, hell i hated her and cheered when she died. i don't understand what the director was trying to do with his demon redneck idea, but it just looked like sloppy writing and convenient bullsh*t with no real thought behind it to me. this is officially the worst movie i've seen all year. congratulations shiban, you now rank up there with such greats as micheal bay in the prestigious "shouldnt be allowed to waste millions of dollars on making a film" club. i hope you read this, i really do. and to the 163 idiots that rated this film 10 out of 10 bwahhahahahah oh my god i hope a redneck demon appears conveniently behind you and tortures you.

spoiler wolfcreek meets texas chainsaw massacre....if you've seen those, don't waste your time with this one. typical slasher movie, nothing new here except for the spoiler "visions" which just add fluff to an already weak plot. i would recommend this movie if you have absolutely nothing to watch and it's either see this movie or stare at a bare wall for 1.5 hrs. the only semi-interesting part spoiler is when the chick starts drinking in the empty sheriff's office, i say it's interesting because at least she made good use of that liquor instead of stereotypically using it to start a fire to kill the bad guy, although she did go that route towards the end. all in all, lame, bad, and not worth effort.

what has rajiv rai done to himself? once a hit director of films like tridev and vishwatama is now making one bad film after another. i was initially excited at the thought of rajiv rai returning to the action genre but that soon fizzled out. as a rajiv rai fan i thought i should at least give it a go but i left after an hour. one reason for me leaving the film so early so the amount of paki- bashing in the film, this was not in rai's previous venture.a lot of directors have tried paki- bashing but i did not expect it from rajiv rai another letdown was the music. rajiv rai's have always had good music until now. there is only one good song and that is tere dekh dekh ladgayan. the performances are not upto scratch, not even from rai loyalist naseer-uddin- shah. avoidable fare from once my favourite director.

watched this film with an audience of....5 in total! had a choice between lakshya and asambhav...(realized then i should have gone for lakshya). a typical plot...india v pakistan..but just isn't cricket as you have kashmir in the middle. an indian super hero goes on a mission to save the president of india from some pakistani rebels who are involved in a mass drug smuggling racket. i left the film half way as it was simply boring and the plot was confusing and all over the place. the songs were also awful, the film tries to hide the flaws with its special effects but unfortunately they are outdated too.overall...avoid it if you can, has to be the worst film i've seen this year.

a pretentious but - to varying degrees - watchable collection of mostly pointless "stories".but let's start from the top.kaurismaki: if one ever wondered what finnish love/romance was like, perhaps this dull little oddity is some indication. subdued feelings, non-emotions, apathetic faces and a very depressing prospect of moving from finland to siberia! i guess the sequel to this story will be "for our honeymoon we move from siberia to greenland". aki obviously had no clue what to write for this little movie, so he just made up some half-assed non-"story" centering around a band he particularly likes (or maybe they're his friends) because we get to watch them and listen to their music more than the two principal characters.erice: first off, i've never heard of this guy before  and now i know why. nice black&white photography and pretty much nothing else - unless being bored silly can be considered an asset. but you'd be surprised how many movie-critics and film students love boredom in movies so i hotly recommend erice's 10-minute snooze-fest to those two groups of humanoids.herzog: not a movie but probably a slice out of his documentaries about tribes in south america. this isn't a short film but a report, but considering how dull the first two entries were, herzog's bit is almost refreshing and does have some interesting moments, and if nothing else fits into the movie's pretentious "time" concept very neatly.jarmusch: as was to be almost expected, this once-interesting film-maker (with the brain of a peanut; a talented idiot savant) serves us yet another doze of pointlessness. he has become lazy and can't be bothered to write anything interesting, either for his own movies or a collection such as tmo. the only bright side in watching how a dumb veggie actress spends 10 minutes in a trailer is that she is played by the lovely chloe sevigny. otherwise, skip this nonsense. oh, and btw: i don't believe that any young actress listens to classical music; was jarmusch trying to be surreal by making chloe listen to that kind of music? does lindsey lohan perhaps listen to opera? maybe drew barrymore is a jazz fan? who am i to say they aren't?!jim jarmusch is a moron. oh, right... i already mentioned that...wenders: here is the actual shock of the whole movie: wenders can actually make something good!!!!!? everything else i've seen from this overrated charlatan has so far been dull and pointless. however, this short little story is done with style(!  atypical) and is the best part of the movie. it leaves one wanting to see more of it, even though the story has a resolution.spike lee: oh, dear lord what can i say here? lee makes anyone seem talented by comparison. like herzog, he chooses not a story but submits a report  and a left-wing political propaganda report at that! cnn, but in black and white, and one-sided, of course. naturally, "we wuz robbed", the retarded title of this little sleep-inducer, is about how the poor, gullible and infinitely idealistic democrats wuz robbed by bush and his evil evil team of thieves. this is by far the dumbest and dullest entry in this movie, and i had to utilize the fast-forward button so as not to doze off. spike lee truly is a product of affirmative action. god knows how many really talented (black) directors never had a chance to make movies because this pretentious and talentless little runt keeps getting opportunity after opportunity to make them. and he gets it wrong every time! now that does take some kind of talent, right? kaige: the chinese story has a solid premise. it's okay, nothing more.all in all, there are many and far better movies to spend your time on, but if your time isn't that valuable (as is apparently the case with my own) you can check this little film out."ten minutes sure can be an eternity in the hands of anti-masters of cinema. time is precious. waste it on better movies." - fedor miklowitz, 1588

i have been reading comments on imdb for some time now. an 8.3 average for this movie just plain gets on my nerves. i don't mean to pull one of those "i just signed up for an account so i can post on this movie" bits..... but, i just did. the only theme you will come away with from this movie is that incest does not deserve to be ridiculed.now, i realize many 'hoity-toity' film people love this movie; nevertheless, it is crap. the thing that really gets to me is the fact that the director expects you to have sympathy for the 'villain' in the movie. if you do have sexual relations with your sister, you should probably be an outcast from society. just my personal feelings i guess. yet, i sat through 2 hours of this *expletive* expecting some really deep reasoning behind dae-soo's imprisonment.i tend to like a lot of foreign movies, but this is my first encounter with a korean flick and it has put them last in line in my book. oh... i feel better already after a little venting.

let me get this out of the way before i trash this film: i love park chan-wook's work as a director. while i disagree with the masses saying he's is the best director working in our time, i can't deny that he understands how to use a camera very effectively. i really liked one of his other films, sympathy for mr. vengeance. also, min-sik choi's acting was the only thing that allowed me to take this film seriously . . . for 1/5 of the runtime, that is.now the bad: the plot is simply the oldest cliché used in cinema/literature. i'll never understand how critics can trash a hollywood blockbuster for being cliché, then hail movies like oldboy which are just as unoriginal and clichéd if not even more so. regardless, oldboy is flat-out one of the most generic, unoriginal movies ever conceived. *spoilers* man is held captive, man seeks revenge, man finds out he had sex with a family member, man's life is over. *end spoilers* simply put, this plot line has been used in everything from greek plays to modern melodramatic soap operas and countless movies/books in between. it is so melodramatic and unoriginal when the major reveal happens, i laughed out loud. does that mean i'm a desensitized freak without emotions as some reviews of this film say about people like me? no. what it means overdone plots make people laugh. the scary movie franchise proved that, and oldboy proved it as well. why can't people think of something that is truly disturbing instead of just spewing out tried clichés masked with fancy camera-work and classical music? that brings up the issue of blood/gore. simply put, it isn't there. the director is too timid to even point the camera at the screen when something "gory" happens, as if we're watching a children's movie or something. maybe we were. anyway, i've heard oldboy called the "most brutal movie of all time" and "the most disturbing movie ever" but when i watched it i failed to see anything even remotely gory or disturbing. all the "gore" is off-screen, and even then the violence level is nothing you haven't seen in pg-13 movies like the dark knight or casino royale before. why this even got an r-rating confuses me, much less "the most brutal movie of all time". seriously, i've seen movies that just make oldboy look cute on every level when it comes to violence/gore.the other huge glaring, cheesy flaw is the main villain. the majority of his screen time he's showing his bare butt off for the audience in comedic american pie-style, but i'm supposed to think he's oh-so-evil? when he's wearing clothes, his hair is slicked back like a bad asian mix of the cheesiest james bond villain mixed with something out of austin powers. he talks like a brain-dead teenager recovering from an acid overdose, and his dialogue is so bad it had me laughing yet again. seriously, oldboy had me laughing more than any comedy this year . . .in the end, oldboy is for those of you who sip fine wine, have no sense of humor, and talk about how boring your lives are at dinner parties. it's for those people who are so stuck up in their own ego they forgot how unoriginal they are, and consequently forgot how unoriginal and boring the "films" (never "movies") they enjoy are.to those people all i can say is this: i like "films" and also like "movies". i like thoughtful dramas that actually say something about the human condition, and i also like pointless action movies that thrill me into a coma. but the thing is, for me to like both "films" and "movies", they have to be original. they have to be something i haven't seen so many times i lost count of the number of times the plot has been used. when something isn't original, it's expendable. if it does exactly what everyone else does, it's forgettable and boring. before you give oldboy yet another perfect rating because it "touched" you, maybe you should think about something: wouldn't a movie equally as touching, but at the same time original make you think more? i just wish someone other than me would understand this.overall: oldboy is forgettable and cheesy.1/10

... so some people might argue that this can't possible be the worst movie ever made, and no it's not. i have seen movies with weaker plots, worse acting and so on.so why do i hate this movie über alles? well, it's basically about a man, who gets kidnapped for many years, and when he comes out, he tries to find out who did it and why, to get revenge. the problem i have with this movie has nothing to do with gore or horror, but***major spoilers stop reading if you don't want to know*** our main character basically gets tricked into having sex with his own daughter, and he wants to cut out his own tongue so his enemy won't tell her, because she didn't know. it is so humiliating as he crawls on his knees like a dog in total submission. and why did he deserve this? because many years ago, he saw a brother and a sister have a tender moment - in the wrong way. he went on and told some people, and as a result she commits suicide. and viola, it's the brother who put our main character through all this just for that. i have wondered: maybe i hate this movie so much because i think his punishment is way too harsh. maybe because i feel this movie doesn't condemn incest, but somehow confuses it with love. maybe it's because i expected something else.***end of spoilers***believe me, nobody deserves what happens to our main character in the end, and i'm very serious; you know how some movies just go under your skin and stay there? well, i felt goddamn dirty after watching this movie, and i really wish i'd never seen it. it stayed with me for days, and some might ask: well, isn't that the purpose of a good movie? the ability to affect us in such ways? yes, it can be, but this movie not only made me sick, it made me feel violated.

when one of my friends recommended this to me, raving about how well it was filmed, the underlying themes and the general greatness of the film, i obviously expected an amazing, at least entertaining film.the two hours i spent watching this turned out to be a huge disappointing waste of my time.i understand that this movie is meant to be surreal, but even in surreal movies, there is something which anchors it down, even if it is only in the slightest. this movie, on the other hand, felt forced and fake. a lot of the shots were unnecessary and watching it made me think the director was trying to hard to be artistic.the acting was poor, and the relationships between characters were not nearly developed enough. maybe that's just me missing something that others could see but i hadn't even realised there was any sort of attraction between dae su and migo before they started getting at it like rabbits randomly half way through the film. then again, maybe this film was just bad.i am not against violence in movies, but in this one, almost all of it was just unnecessary. throughout all the fight scenes i felt myself cringing at how painfully cliché it all was.and the plot? the word laughable comes to mind. i would be amused if i hadn't wasted two hours of my life following this poorly thought out and ridiculous plot. despite all the movie's flaws, by the end of it, i was expecting something interesting to conclude it. i won't discuss the ending, because i wouldn't want to "spoil" the movie for those who haven't seen it. just that the metaphor "be it a rock or a grain of sand, in water they sink as the same." cannot be used as an explanation for everything.this entire movie was made for shock value and shock value only. i just hope sooner or later people will stop being so pretentious and recognise a bad movie for what it is. i've seen many other great korean films and it depresses me that people have hailed oldboy as the best.

*****classic ****excellent ***good **fair *tragicreview:oldboy is not for everyone. it's pervasive violence, its live octopus eating and it's unimaginary story.the film focuses around a man who's been kidnapped and is imprisoned for 15 years, oh dae-su is released, only to find that he must find his captor in 5 days. now the story though may seem gripping to start with but once watching this bloated and un-original blood fest it develops into a mash of bitter blood and a forceful film.it's directing is on par of average and by no means the standards of what a south korean thriller should be. oldboys acting scenes are paralleled with dull humour and a poorly writtern script.oldboy is occasionlly presented with thin straw performances that one could only feel shameful about.verdict:not for everyone but it's scope and vision isn't clear enough to see further than the grey abyss of fog.*tragic

there's a thin line between being theatrical and being just plain forced. forced acting. forced takes. forced plot. even forced photography. there's people who say "the movie develops that way because it's from asia" but i don't see any kind of forced elements on seven samurai or sonatine. there's a thin line between being fiction (and every work of art it is, in it's way, fiction) and being just unlikely.in a more personal way, i just don't feel anything with the movie, it doesn't take me anywhere, and i just can't believe in the fictional world it is proposed. it just doesn't feel right, there's something in it or through that just doesn't click.

oldboy is set in korea & starts as a drunken dae-su oh (min-sik choi) is bailed out of the police station by his friend only to be abducted, dae-su wakes up & finds himself in a small room which he will be imprisoned in for the next fifteen years. dae-su is fed & looked after by his unknown captors but is never allowed out of the room, dae-su begins to train himself to avenge himself after he gets out which he intends to do by scrapping away the cement from the brickwork with a chopstick. however before dae-su finishes he is gassed & rendered unconscious, when he wakes up dae-su finds himself free on the roof of a tall building dressed & all moneyed up. dae-su instantly sets about trying to find out who imprisoned him, after meeting the pretty mido (hye-jeong kang) the two fall in love & together with her help dae-su finally finds what he is looking for but the truth comes at a price...this south korean production was co-written & directed by chan-wook park & has gotten any number of glowing reviews (the sort that distributors can pick quotes out & plaster them on the video box) & even won the grand prize of the jury at cannes while it was also nominated for the golden palm so surely oldboy is a true classic? well not for me it isn't since as i can't understand why it's so liked & i would go as far as to say i pretty much hated it apart from one or two isolated moments. for a start i couldn't get into the story at all, i just didn't like it as i thought it was slow & boring & while many out there would have you believe oldboy has the bestest most shocking twist ever i thought it was rather plain & not very well executed either. the ending in which dae-su goes to the new zealand alps to be hypnotised feels tagged on as well almost as if the makers wanted some sort of happy ending. at almost two hours i almost fell asleep i was so bored, the violence is tame & it's the thought of what's happening that i would imagine most people have a problem with rather than what is actually shown. in fact oldboy has a very low body count of about seven & one mild sex scene, it's really not that graphic or memorable. i didn't warm to any of the character's & while i accept oldboy has an alright concept & premise it fails to deliver & it's one film that i will never understand why so many people seem to like.based on a japanese manga of the same name oldboy the film looks alright, there's one or two nice visual moments here although while everyone raves about the hallway fight that takes place in one continuous shot i was pretty unimpressed & thought the fight choreography was quite dull. the actual on-screen gore violence amounts to very little, dae-su eats a live octopus which is apparently quite normal in korea anyway, there are some fight scenes, a severed hand, someones teeth are pulled out & there's a bit of blood at the end.the budget was supposedly around the $4,000,000 mark which is actually a fair bit, filmed in south korea & new zealand. the acting looks alright but it's hard to tell when actors are speaking a different language.oldboy is a film that i found an absolute chore to sit through, i don't mind subtitled films or foreign films or paying attention to the plot as i followed the thing perfectly but i just didn't like any of it & it's as simple & straightforward as that. apparently the second in director choi-wook park's revenge trilogy which also includes sympathy for mr. vengeance (2002) & lady vengeance (2005).

this movie was one of the longest movie watching experiences of my life. while i like how the director, chan-wook park, handled the revenge, the move as a whole was terrible. oldboy is only billed at 1 hour and 55 minutes long but it feels like it takes at least 3 and a half hours to tell this story. i will say that the english dubbing was done very well and the movie was easily understandable. i felt that some of the scenes were unnecessarily long and a lot of the dialogue repeated itself. also, if you have an aversion to annoying voices, then avoid hearing hye-jeong kang (she plays mi-do) speak. if you are looking for a movie to kill time and make you feel morally superior to others, then watch away. if you don't want to watch a movie filled with incest, bad dialogue, unnecessary fight scenes, gross torture scenes and confusing flashbacks, then this is not the movie for you.

please do not blame korea for this bad movie. i am in korea (please excuse bad english). it sadden me to see these movies which make korea look like obsessed with blood and sex. it sadden me even more to see animal killings and hear americans say that is how korea is. we do not eat live animals!! so please stop excusing movie for its crime by saying it is the culture! there is scenes with the man eating live animals and non koreans think it is normal. no it is disgusting to us too. the director is a misfit, sick individual who has obsession with killing and sex with family members. i wish america and france will stop glorifying this bad man who is laughable in his own country. please watch any other movie from korea, that will give you ideas of how artistic we really are. this movie is rubbish.

unbelievable. "philosophy". "depth". "genius". "masterpiece". people must have seen another "oldboy" because the one i've seen was a badly written, poorly conceived, over-the-top-acted, sordid piece of "kraapola" which, even ignoring for a moment the ludicrously violent scenes which makes it unsuitable for the eyes of a child, could barely satisfy the imagination and the thirst for plot consistency of a seven years old.the "depth" of this sorry concoction was exhausted in one little piece of wisdom, "laugh and the whole world will laugh with you, weep and you'll find yourself alone", the type of boring fortune cookie saying which a great author, be him shakespeare or, more to the point of imdb, kurosawa, would have thrown in the garbage can with no second thoughts. where this movie should have landed too, if we wouldn't live in an era in which the cheaply shocking and the perversely disgusting are confused with what used to be named once "great art". in short, yuck.2 out of 100. it's not 1 out of 1000 only because of some occasionally expert camera-work. in no way enough to save this infantile failure from worthlessness, though.

it seems that some viewers assume that the only thing which can make the viewer dislike this movie is the graphic violence. in fact violence, both disturbing and cartoonish, is the last of "oldboy"'s deep flaws. the characters are unidimensional, underdeveloped, primitive. the "intensity", an obsession and a goal in itself with this director, is served up with the cheapest of means. let's not confuse a mindless shot of adrenaline with artistic worth. by the end of the movie, it seems that all the cards were exhausted so the script becomes almost inadvertently funny in its efforts to find new levels of "horror", to continue to "shock" an audience which is already numbed by the plethora of dumb soap-opera "revelations" already served up in big bunches. it would be hard to imagine anybody even vaguely familiar with the masterpieces of the last fifty years of asian cinema being enthralled by this pompous piece of trash. imagine homer simpson hesitating in front of the cinema theater: "should i go in or should i buy five cones of ice-cream for the same money?" be smart, homer, go for the ice-cream.

i am sorry to rain on everybody's parade. just a little background about me: i like and know a lot about asian cinema, especially japanese, chinese and indian. admittedly i am a novice when it comes to south-korean cinema but, if this is the best of the best, sorry. i just want you to know that i am not at all narrow-minded when it comes to appreciating foreign movies and i do not fit the stereotype of the "dumb american" . . . well, not perfectly.i cannot believe the high praise this piece of nothing is bestowed upon. this is a disgusting *and* ludicrous movie. hammy acting - everything is badly done and overdone, like begging for the uneducated viewer's attention. horrible camera-work, with an insistence on meaningless close-ups derived from the mtv aesthetics.the plot is more full of holes than a gigantic piece of swiss cheese. nobody expects a thriller to be 100% realistic, and for the sake of entertainment i'd be happy to close my eyes to small unfitting details. but, excuse me, what's happening here that *can* stand even summary scrutiny? this story of an unbelievably intricate and contrite act of revenge is worse than the worst tabloid story one can read in a line at the supermarket. (don't want to spoil your "enjoyment", if that's the word, so won't go into details of the plot.) the fighting scenes are violent, unbelievable, downright stupid (the main "hero" taking on dozens and dozens of opponents in the same time, after he only trained while imprisoned, punching a wall ! ) the truly "outstanding" features of this movie are two: the lurid and incestuous sex (brother on sister and father on daughter, well, we've evolved since oedipus, didn't we?) and the graphic violence. the cut off body parts - hands, teeth, tongues - together with industrial quantities of spilled blood (how many tens of thousands of tomatoes had to die for this movie to be made?) have no esthetical function/motivation whatsoever.a feast for the s & m inclined, admittedly, but, even for those, a feast of no merit nor subtlety. heavens, even mel gibson's recent and much-discussed work on an almost similar theme wasn't that bad.the invariably good press this pretentious, overblown, overlong piece of gratuitous gore coming from korean shores obtains makes me wonder what's happening. i don't think of myself as being the ultimate paragon of taste and often i am ready to accept that a movie i didn't enjoy may be better than i was able to perceive. however, i have no scruples whatsoever in calling this one as i see it: bad, bad, bad. no redeeming qualities. my 2c? find something better to do with your time.

this comment is meant mainly as a warning to the people who might be attracted to the title by its (temporarily)high user rating which i find frankly puzzling. the reasons why i didn't like this title are following:1. the directer must have had some doubts whether to make a jackie-chan-type of a flick or a dark oedipian tragedy. as a result, in terms of genre, the film falls between two stools, as the tragic and comic elements clash and cancel out each other rather than make a harmonious whole.2. the characters' motives and behaviors are incoherent and unconvincing. psychological truth and logic are sadly missing.3. absurd casting. i don't blame the actors, for it is a hard thing to create a convincing character by acting alone, if there is scarce logic in the script. however, why is there an apparent age difference of about 15 years between the leading two actors, whose ages in the film can't differ by more than 3-4?4. to me the film was poor entertainment primarily because of point 2. if you can't find a character you could sympathize with it is hard to follow the story with interest. when you finally learn the reason of what happened to the main protagonist, it turns out to make no sense.5. some films apart from being entertaining are also thought-provoking. having seen this film, i began to wonder whether the thought the director tried to provoke was not that incestuous relationships could be perfectly wholesome and delightful. i cannot put any other construction on the ending. 6. the film is rife with totally unnecessary violence. violence in a film (and elsewhere) is a good thing, if it serves an important and worthy purpose. purposes can be different and i don't want to enter into this broad subject. let me just say i don't object to violence in such films as "saving private ryan", "the passion of the christ" or "the pulp fiction". in "oldboy" the scenes of torture and suffering are prolonged and graphic (or aural). what for? i do not know. personally, i don't derive any satisfaction from watching teeth being extracted with a hammer or hear a man cut off his tongue with scissors and then see him choking on his own blood etc. etc. 7. the film reminds me a little of japanese porno mangas in its fixation on incest and young asian girls' panties, urinating and the like. it appears there is a minority who actually enjoy this kind of thing. if you're one of them, you might find this film enjoyable.in short, i do not recommend this film either as entertainment or "food for thought". where it isn't silly, it is disgusting. don't waste your time.

this movie was awful, plain and simple. it will probably be revered by those who only see "films" and not "movies" and will therefore feel sorry for me for having such a limited understanding of the theatrical brilliance of this film, but i am secure enough in my intellect to say that this boring, self-aggrandizing and painfully drawn-out movie was a waste of two hours and nine dollars.i was suckered into seeing this by the inexplicable good reviews it had been receiving and came out of the theater thinking that those reviews had to have been written by over-excited film students and the aforementioned group of individuals who shun regular movies, perhaps for fear that they may actually enjoy one someday.the storyline is quite a promising one - a man is imprisoned for 15 years, never knowing his captor nor his crime. he is then abruptly released and given just five days to discover the identity and reason of the man who imprisoned him. however, the great concept soon disintegrates into a pathetic joke as oh dae-su runs around beating people up, trying to have sex with a young girl who is attempting to use the toilet and eating a live, writhing squid (presumably for dramatic effect, as there is absolutely no other reason for it). all the while he is trying to figure out this horrible thing he did to earn himself fifteen years in jail, and when he finally finds out it is both ridiculous and a major letdown. his nemesis, a man who supposedly went to school with him when he was a young man, looks like a banana republic model twenty years younger than him. hey, i know prison has been hard on oh dae-su, but is it too much to ask to find an actor that looks a bit closer to his age? of all the things wrong with this movie, this one seems like the easiest one to fix.and the big secret - the one that kept me in my seat for 90 minutes when i could have been out doing something productive - is some joke of a plot line involving incest and a rumor started in high school. come on! throw us a bone here - was that really the best they could do? i sat through stupid dialogue, over-acting, gloomy sets and gratuitous violence for this? (by the way - i'm not at all against violence in a film if it seems to fit the story, but in this case it seems i was forced to watch our hero knock out someone's front teeth and cut off his own tongue with a pair of scissors in order to distract me from figuring out i was wasting my afternoon watching a pretentious piece of garbage).take my advice - do something else with your time and money. or take your nine dollars and go see a lowly "movie" - one that you might actually enjoy.

by jove, what an unholy mess! revenge, incestuous love, mechanical games-like fighting, ceaseless and utterly unnecessary violence, some primitive "music" hammering away at the bewildered victims, big "surprises" (which actually tend to be about as "revelatory" as the national enquirer's headlines). add some shoddy camera movements pretending to be stylish and creative and you've already impressed the crowds. this movie's totally undeserved popularity powerfully indicates the very low level pop sub-culture has succeeded not only in achieving in the last decades, but also in imposing as dominant taste on an impotent audience. (for by far deeper insights into human sufferance under mental sickness, without "oldboy"s vulgar excesses, i recommend an older dutch/french movie, "the vanishing".) well, don't believe there's absolutely nothing good to say about this movie. in fact there is. the (in)famous scene in which the hero (is really a "hero", an abject father who sleeps with his daughter and then attempts to obtain forgetfulness rather than redemption?) eats a live octopus benefits greatly from the vivid presence of the best actor in the entire cast: the octopus itself. too bad the poor beast, having been eaten, couldn't survive its one and only act in order to obtain yet another worthless diploma, for the "best actor", at the cannes festival. which festival, by the way, between moore's propaganda nonsense and this epitome of worthless if somewhat exotic weirdness, became a festival of the vapid and of the ludicrous.sic transit gloria mundi!

first off, i'am a horror fan. but this "tobe hooper" production (come on, the man from the original texas chainsaw and poltergeist !!) was below standards, even for a fan. the acting was not bad at all, some characters were unbelievable, but the leading ladies were ok. the story was something we've seen a hundred times already, without any surprising twist or whatever. never exciting or intense, and do not count on any special effects besides blood splashing up. the scary zombie kids are white paled faces with dark eyes and that is it.. that might have worked in the early 70's but not now. director j.s. cardone didn't do a good job in keeping the suspense, half way thru there is a risk you will fall asleep. my vote is based primarily on the leading acting, but this could have easily have been called children of the corn 8: from the corn fields to the mines... enough said..

the concept of this movie is pretty compelling: zombie children climbing out of an abandoned mine to seek revenge for their deaths in the backwoods of pennsylvania. cool. the problem i had with the movie is the lack of creativity when dealing with the zombies. the makers could have really spiced this film up with some terror-like imagery a la "the ring" such as stop action, reverse camera walking or stuff like that. when the zombie children are strolling through the woods they look like a bunch of 9 year-olds walking to a playground in west philadelphia. instead of pick axes and shovels they could have easily been carrying baseball bats and gloves. why would i fear these little kids? anyone could just run away in a straight line to safety. also, who in their right mind would have stayed one night with their children in that creepy, run-down house? the moment i opened that front door and looked around i would have said, "mm-hmm. mm-hmm. son, go start the car. i'm going around back to pee on a bush and then we're out of here." totally unbelievable movie. don't waste your time.

wicked little things has an excellent synopsis: empty house beside abandoned mine in woods with tragic past; family moves into house and strange things begin to happen; little creepy children begin to pop up here and there doing creepy-little-children-things. but that is where the cleverness and potential fun ends. this group of kids was sealed in the mine many decades earlier, and now appear roving the woods (poor make-up) with weapons looking for flesh to eat. oh i get it, this is a ghost-zombie movie. hmmm....while i can appreciate someone trying something new with this genre, this just didn't work. what was the children's motivation in seeking to devour flesh? why did they need weapons? did anyone else imagine the filmmakers all gathered around the daily footage giggling because they felt this was going to be a cool/scary movie? i found that after thirty minutes i felt the familiar resignation that i had just wasted my time on another modern crap-fest. while the acting was good, and the setting/cinematography of good quality as well, the script itself suffered from what seems to be a lack of knowledge about the supernatural horror genre altogether. a bunch of kids walking down the mall is scarier than this pack of poorly disguised rodents.this movie is not scary, and while i can appreciate the story, perhaps have even enjoyed it if i had read it instead of watched it, i still have to say that wicked little things is more accurately called wicked little turd.

throughout watching "end of days", i got the sense that the film makers were perhaps trying to make this unique to the average hollywood action film. they failed, of course, but you have to give them credit for trying. peter hyams actually tried directing this time, instead of just churning out another flat action film. he attempted to inject atmosphere into the movie by darkening the lights and adding tons of blood. this method can work if used correctly (see "se7en") but here it just feels like a cheap trick to try and scare us. hyams is a decent action director, and offers nothing more here than basic shoot outs and fight scenes, except for the lackluster, sub par f/x end "battle". as a photographer, hyams demonstrates actual ability, displaying some good frame work and movement, but it is nothing above solid work.screenwriter andrew marlowe is the film's greatest enemy. at parts, the script actually shows the makings of good religious thriller, and at times it even shows some quasi-intellectual thought (the temptation scene between arnold and gabriel byrne), but these small pluses are choked out by a river of negatives. generic dialogue/characters, gapping plot holes, and convenient plot points that just happen to point all the characters in the right direction are just a few of the standard hollywood black holes marlowe's screenplay falls into. the shadow of the good movie it could have been faded very quickly.the film surprisingly has a good cast. arnold, still possessing that larger than life attitude, tries to play a depressed, on the edge cop with no more than average results. stick to be the invincible hero arnie, it's what your good at. gabriel byrne is the strong point of the ensemble, bringing a nice air of cynicism to the role of satan. in a villainous role ripe for overacting, byrne restrains himself and it adds a bit more menace to the character. kevin pollak, as normal, is able to bring at least a few chuckles to the movie, but he's done better. also look for a stellar small role from rod steiger.hyams looked like he was trying to separate this from the faceless mass of hollywood action films. he was heading in the right direction, but had neither the script or originality to take it there.4/10

end of days is one of the worst big-budget action movies i've ever seen. muddling direction, meandering script loaded with lame dialogues and gaping plot holes, rapid-fire mtv-style editing and poor acting all the way.that's not to say end of days isn't watchable. the movie kept me interested because i found ah-nuld's latest action flick laughably stupid for being so inept and silly when it comes to logic. without the sense of logic the movie dies quicker, which is why end of days deserved a huge drop of box office reception in its second week after the opening in the u.s.i won't go into the details explaining why end of days violates the law of movie logic, but here are several problems with this movie:(spoiler)after the devil walks out, the restaurant explodes without any trace as to how he did it. no snapping finger, no tampered energy gas to ignite the fire, nothing. how could this happen?arnold and his annoying sidekick kevin pollack somehow magically comes up with the name "christine york" after examining the phrase "christ in new york" carved on a victim's body, runs the database on the computer and, viola, christine york, the only person with the exact name in all of new york city! beyond my suspension of disbelief. how did the characters who have come in contact with arnold's character turn against him later in the movie? i laughed out loud when i recognized the good-stepmother-turned-evil-stepmother is the same actress who played a nanny in william shakespeare's romeo + juliet. her ironic transition from that film to this was absolutely hilarious if you can imagine.all the mindlessly huge explosions and gunfires. what did you expect in the arnold schwarzenegger vehicle?the devil took a man's body comprising of flesh and blood, yet he's invisible to bullets and explosions by healing through that body. logically, this is impossible.as the devil demostrates the illusion in the apartment, arnold's character runs into the solid christmas tree that supposedly is an illusion and *falls on it* physically.the devil is capable of punching the person's brains out and twisting a victim's head 180 degree, yet he could not kill arnold's character as he always intends to.how the devil's object of desire's parents died and why evil new yorkers run after arnold and the object of desire were never explained at all.in the sequence that's a rip-off of speed, arnold and the devil's object of desire manage to escape the subway train wreck by the short distance inside unscathed. this is beyond my comprehension, since the force would be enough to throw arnold and the object of desire around violently and die from fatal wounds seconds after impact.arnold suffers the brutal beating from the mob sanctioned by the devil and put him on the cross to hang against the wall, yet the devil forgot to take the time and opportunity to kill him for convenience's sake.at the beginning of the movie, after the devil took over a man's body, all of a sudden arnold is his bodyguard??? is this a coincidence or just an example of bad editing?arnold's recital of cringe-inducing dialogues in the particularly laughable scenes like "you are a choirboy compared to me!" are the perfect fodder for mst3k, just as eraser did with the classic line "you're the luggage!".the whole theory about 666/1999 is downright ludicrous. so are the pseudo-religious babble about the christian theology involving the end of the world at precisely midnight and the fanatic killers who know the location of the devil's object of desire. (end spoilers)it is highly ironic that end of days uses the scattered profanities abusing the deity while rambling about christian theories. the level of violence in the film is excessive and gruesome, and is therefore unnecessary to serve the plot. the director's indulgence of excess is a factor here. he surely doesn't know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money.hence, end of days is a worthless film with no redeeming value except for campiness -- arnold's worst since hercules in new york.     

these days, asian horror films are among the best in the world, noted for their atmosphere and reflection of contemporary society. this is not one of those films! instead, "the record" is a mediocre slasher movie highly derivative of american movies like "i know what you did last summer" and "scream". the plot is familiar - 5 teenagers accidently commit a terrible crime, but cover it up swearing to secrecy. one year later, they're being stalked by a knife-wielding maniac (with the decidely unscary disguise of a hospital sterile mask and an orange jumpsuit). it doesn't help that the teenagers are a generally unlikable group (this is one of those movies where the killer's motives seem pretty reasonable) and there are numerous stupid plot setups to keep the story going. the direction of the movie is unsubtle, more influenced by mtv than by current asian horror films (like "the ring"). the last third of the movie isn't too bad though, delivering some decent suspense scenes, though there is probably one "twist" too many in the end. 4/10

robert aldrich's brutal, quasi-black comedy "the grissom gang", a reworking of the 1948 british film "no orchids for miss blandish", has 1920s heiress kim darby kidnapped by a pack of clumsy thieves; soon, that gang is dispatched and poor kim is then transferred into the clutches of another crooked bunch--third-rate gangster brothers with sweaty, pasty faces and a mother who looks like buddy ebsen in drag. at first, darby (not very plucky, and not very smart) attempts to escape this drooling brood, but they're onto her. eventually she just gives up trying, and therein lies the trouble with the story. are we in the audience supposed to sympathize with her? is her growing concern for the family half-wit supposed to be heartwarming? these are disgusting, cretinous characters, and i wanted to see as little of them as possible. but since the side-stories (the progress of the cops on the case and another one involving floozy-singer connie stevens) are rather dull, the director has no choice but to keep foisting those sweaty faces on us. pretty soon, nervous darby starts sweating too, although her scene up in the hayloft is sensitively performed and aldrich's climactic moments are thought-provoking, if disorganized. ** from ****

it is truly saddening to see a once-great director such as deodato delivering such a second-rate giallo such as this. this movie was so terrible it effectively put an end to his movie career. the box lies, this is no "erotic thriller", hell during the film's 97 minute running time, charlotte lewis barely shows us one nipple! i thought it would pick up once william burger showed up (in one of his last roles), but his character is killed off rather abruptly and lamely. this movie fails in pretty much every way. claudio simonetti's music is little more than noise, and the plot made very little sense at all. for some reason, lewis is terrorized by ghosts which attack using phones. (?) by the end, the characters all seem to have forgotten the previous 90 minutes of hell they went through, and casually laugh as they sick the evil spirits on someone else, lewis's ex-boyfriend. what?!? this movie did little for me besides anger me.... and bore me half to death. for genuine 80's deodato fun, watch the barbarians or the atlantis interceptors, let this one rot on the video store shelf. argento could make a better giallo than this!

don't be fooled by the plot out-line as it is described on the cover (at least the swedish version). the story on this seems rather interesting, with speculative hints. nothing can be further from the truth. this is the absolute most sad movie experience i've ever had... it is plain and right awful and should not be sold or rented to anyone. if you still think the plot seems intriguing, reflect on this: telephones can move, run and kill people as can also any other electric appliance. it can throw things at you, haunt you and run after you. please do not watch this movie it is a disgrace for the horror genre...

this is only the fourth effort i’ve watched from this director (whom i met and found quite genial at the 2004 venice film festival italian b-movie retrospective) and also, possibly, the worst. as was the case with the bronx executioner (1989), which preceded it, this is a prime example from the tail end of the euro-cult era – prime because it shows the depths to which the previously invigorating style had fallen by this time! here, in fact, we get a plot revolving around – i’m not kidding, folks – a killer phone! pretty but bland charlotte lewis – in her third film after pirates (1986) and the golden child (1986) – is a model who, apparently, has just ended an affair; she keeps expecting her architect lover to call her back but, every time the phone rings, all she gets is static accompanied by voices from the beyond (or some such crap). she befriends a new tenant at her apartment block who, conveniently, knows of an authority on paranormal activity (william berger) – who, hilariously, explains that the negative energy which is unleashed, say, during family arguments can manifest itself via home appliances into a deadly force (i swear i ain’t making this up)! among the highlights...er...lowpoints of the film are: the grumpy bartender from whose dingy place the heroine calls a couple of times (it seems that the chain-of-events can only be broken by having lewis go through her paces again, exterminating angel (1962)-style!), the sheer variety of preposterous-looking phones on display, the apparatus of the heroine’s photographer friend sneaking up on her before the kill, the sarcastic cop who greets lewis on reporting the strange occurrences (“and what’s the toaster up to, i wonder?”), the would-be rapist killed by a barrage of coins shooting out from a telephone booth, and berger’s own bloody demise (with the phone affecting the pacemaker he’s fitted with and causing the doctor’s heart to explode)! the film’s climax is rather confusing and, apparently, finally sees all the ‘lost souls’ inhabiting a flock of doves and flying out the window of the ‘possessed’ office (a lonelyhearts service!). for what it’s worth, the score – by ex-goblin claudio simonetti no less – is effective enough, despite the inclusion of dated heavy-metal numbers on the soundtrack.

well, i was hoping i'd heard wrong about this film as i'm a big fan of ruggero deodato and really didn't want to see him slip up; but unfortunately, this giallo-styled supernatural load of nonsense is just as bad as i'd been lead to believe it would be - and that's pretty terrible! the plot doesn't work at all, as the film attempts to blend murders and a supernatural theme through a telephone and it all feels very forced and silly. furthermore, the plot doesn't make much sense at all, and you have to ask yourself "what's the point" numerous times throughout the movie. the plot focuses on a young woman living in an apartment block and being terrorised by a telephone. the best thing about the movie is undoubtedly the presence of the beautiful english actress charlotte lewis, and unfortunately the good points pretty much stop there. there are a handful of deaths scenes, some of which are gory; but all of which are incredibly stupid, the one that sees someone get killed by coins sticks out especially in that respect. overall, i really can't recommend this to anyone; non-deodato fans are unlikely to impressed, and deodato fans are likely to find the film depressing. avoid!

ring! ring! have-been horror directors hotline, how may we help you? umyeahpronto! i mean hello, my name is rugge err, call me by my initials r.d! okay mr. r.d, what seems to be the problem? well the reviews on my latest movie "dial: help" were all negative and harsh and, frankly, i myself feel like my career has seen better days as well. okay mr. r.d, and why do you suppose that is? well, i gained fame and a well-deserved cult status thanks to my controversial and shocking movie about savage tribes of cannibals devouring a film crew and another one about relentless thugs terrorizing wealthy people in a house at the edge of the park, for which i borrowed the idea from wes craven, but "dial: help" revolves on  err never mind! no no, mr. r.d, go ahead and tell me what the film is about. um, it's about a spiritually possessed phone line stalking a sexy model and killing the people surrounding her. ah, i see. that premise does indeed sound a little silly and not as petrifying as cannibals or rapists, but i suppose there are deeper themes in your film, right? oh yeah, sure um, what do you mean by that? well, isn't the phone line symbolism for another kind of terror? or perhaps it's all just happening in the mind of your female heroine? um, nope it's just about a phone going berserk and murdering people with the cord, vibrations, electricity or even ordinary coins. interesting, mr. r.d, but how do you explain all this supernatural stuff to the viewer at the end of the movie? you see, i figured the slowly unraveling phone-mystery plot wouldn't be that important or relevant, so i just concentrated on processing all possible phone-gimmicks i could think of. phone gimmicks? what do you mean? you know, like wind blowing through the horn, mind-penetrating dial tones, and turn-tables catapulting into the air! very original, mr. r.d, but not exactly horrific and as an experienced director you must know that, in the end, people expect a reasonable clarification of all these events. oh, but there is! it all has to do with negative and unreleased energy, if i remember correctly! it's all a bit fuzzy, i admit. hmm i see. oh well, as they always say, a good motion picture relies on more elements than just the story. did you at least process some of your regular trademarks into the film, so that your fans at least recognize your style? i tried! lord knows i tried, but the murders and bloodshed are simply not shocking anyone! that's a pity indeed, mr. r.d, but what about sex? everyone likes a good portion of sleaze and nudity in their horror films and you said yourself the film centered on a sexy fashion model in peril! yes, but  but what, mr. r.d? well, to tell you the truth, we kind of promoted "dial: help" as an erotic thriller with revealing shots of charlotte lewis on the cover, but in reality there's no sex in the film and charlotte even refused to go topless. mr. r.d! now i'm really disappointed, that's just shamelessly ripping people off and lure them with false promises! i know, i know, and i'm ashamed, but i just wanted everybody to rent "dial: help" and love it! well, to round up i can comfort you by saying that every major director is entitled to a few erroneous decisions without it affecting his/her career immediately, but be more cautious next time and do some research first, okay mr. r.d? i will; thank you! you're welcome. tell me, have you got any ideas for upcoming movies already? yeah, as a matter a fact, i do! i was thinking about making a giallo with a murderous washing machine! doesn't that sound fascinating? hello? hello?

i admit, i was taken in by the provocative stills of charlotte lewis from this film, as well as a comment on the imdb message board devoted to her, calling this picture a "great underrated film". and so i got, with great difficulty, my own copy of "dial help".what a waste.nothing but a cheaply-made blood and gore movie with a ridiculous premise which i'm not even going to repeat, with several telegraphed sequences (for instance, when we see lewis lovingly feeding her fish, we know right away what's going to happen to them later). not even lewis, with her beautiful raven hair, large and luminous brown eyes, full and pouty lips, and stunning figure, can save this film. lewis fans would be better off with "bare essentials", "sketch artist", or even "golden child".

a stunningly beautiful charlotte lewis stars as a woman who is terrorized by a ghosts who torment her on the phone.driven to the edge in terror charlotte is forced to confront this chilling mystery in order to save her sanity and her life.i can't believe that ruggero deodato,the director behind "ultimo mondo cannibale","cannibal holocaust" and "house on the edge of the park" directed this absurd piece of trash.admittedly the music by goblin front man claudio simonetti is pretty good,but the story is painfully stupid.the script by franco ferrini is ridiculous and it makes no sense,the acting is bad and there is absolutely no suspense.the scene in which a prospective rapist of charlotte lewis is killed by coins ejected from a subway telephone is more than laughable.don't waste your time with this piece of crap.there are far better italian horror movies out there!

the most disturbing thing about this film is not that it's a load of hogwash (the cpusa was never really as much an espionage threat as the movie makes out). the troubling aspect is the way that it whitewashes the wholly unsavory tactics of the fbi and the unamerican activities committee. secret informants, gossip turned into accusations, warrantless searches - these are the kind of things secret police thugs like the kgb did, and presumably, what the good patriotic americans were fighting. yet the fbi did them and didn't bat an eye. that's the only realistic part of this movie, and they present it with no sense of shame at all. add to this undermining the constitution itself by having only communists invoke the bill of rights. the film also makes thinly veiled accusations that the black civil rights movement was communist-inspired, another pack of lies. it's extremely difficult in this day to excuse such outrageous propaganda, even understanding the paranoia of the times, when one realizes how damaging it was to real people then.

matt cvetic is a loyal communist in a pittsburgh steel mill who works to recruit workers into the party, even though this isolates himself from his son, family, and neighbors. what makes this even more difficult is that cvetic is actually an fbi agent posing as a communist in order to obtain information about party activities. the party is trying to create a strike at the mill, whereby the pro-strike movement will lead the workers into a wave of propaganda. cvetic also has to contend with beautiful eve merrick, a party member and teacher at his son's school who finds the fact that cvetic is a double agent. when eve learns the ugly truth about the party's real motives, the reds decide she must be liquidated and cvetic must aid her without endangering himself. the film should have plenty of suspense and double crossing but there is very little in this film but (by today's standards) very cheesy propaganda and little action or thrills. lovejoy is very good in the main role, but even he and the rest of the cast seem listless. few surprises here and how did this film receive a oscar nod for best documentary? rating, 4.

there are so very few films where just the title tells you all you need to know about the film. such a film is i was a communist for the fbi. another example would be i married a monster from outer space.the really interesting thing about this film is how in heaven's name did this get nominated for an oscar in the documentary category? it is not a documentary in any sense of the word, it's not even in that hybrid category of docudrama. it's just a rather exploitive film about the work of an fbi undercover agent named matt cvetic who infiltrated the communist party in pittsburgh and got active in trying to take over the steelworker's union for the communists and reporting on said activities to his handlers in the fbi.a documentary of that work might have been interesting, but what we got was a film to fit those paranoid times. i found it fascinating that when cvetic finally broke his cover it was to the house un-american activities committee rather than the trial in new york of the communist party leaders. there was a moment in the film where head communist james millican tells his followers to start spreading the word that the house un american activities committee was composed of a bunch of right wing yahoos looking to get their names in front of the camera. now what could have given him that idea? anyway just connect the dots and no doubt the word their came from j. edgar hoover trying to give some credence to huac by having an effective undercover come out there rather than at an actual trial. little thing there called cross examination.warner brothers who produced i was a communist for the fbi later produced big jim mclain which starred john wayne about a huac investigator in hawaii. huac did grab on to credit for the work done by the honolulu pd in breaking up a communist spy ring there among the dockworkers. but at least in john wayne's film nobody claimed it was a documentary.frank lovejoy is in the title role as cvetic and his fbi handlers are richard webb and philip carey. dorothy hart plays a pittsburgh school teacher who says that there are 30 or so like here in that school system indoctrinating the young among whom is ron hagerthy, lovejoy's son. she has a change of heart about the communists and lovejoy has to save her from a homicidal fate planned by his superiors. ironically hart left the movies and went to work for all places, the united nations which as we know has been accused often of being a communist nest in the usa.over half a century later and we really have very few objective works on film or in print about the communist party of the usa. they were in fact a very active bunch in the labor movement. the real heroes in stopping them were labor organizers like walter reuther in the uaw or david dubinsky in the ilgwu. but since they were people of the left they just don't have the following on the right to be suitable propaganda material.anyway i was a communist for the fbi is an exploitive work based on a real life character and a testament to those paranoid times.

the thesis of father brown is that a good dose of roman catholicism will solve all of life's problems. a little proselytizing i don't mind, but this gets a bit ridiculous at times.some fine actors have played father brown over the years, kenneth more and barnard hughes are two good examples. alec guinness plays him in this film and does all right by him, but you didn't see any great demand for future father brown films.i suppose if you are a committed roman catholic it all makes perfectly good sense. it's far more important to catch the thief and convert him to your religion than see he's brought to justice. but that's what were asked to accept here. in fact there is a preliminary story before the main action of the film. guinness in clerical garb is caught trying to put back stolen articles that one of his parishioners sidney james had heisted during a robbery.that's the story he gives the local cops and of course this is something that james has confided in him so he can't break the confessional. now on to bigger game. master thief flambeau, played by peter finch has stolen a cross that is entrusted to father brown and was said to belong to st. augustine back in the day. but father brown is more interested in getting flambeau to go back to his faith than seeing him brought to justice. so he misleads the cops so he can accomplish his mission.i'm sorry but this whole thing was just too much for me to swallow. father brown i'd hate to say it was guilty of obstruction and ought to have been arrested. and he was under no obligation not to reveal anything he knew about flambeau, the man had not come to him as a penitent seeking absolution and spiritual advice.author g.k. chesterton, a very noted catholic lay person in his day, finds all this very reasonable. carried to his logical conclusion we should replace all police forces with an army of priests.guinness borrows from his own reverend ascoyne d'ascoyne from kind hearts and coronets and from barry fitzgerald in going my way to create father brown. granted though brown is a lot shrewder than the other two. there's also a bit of colonel nicholson in this portrayal. in the bridge on the river kwai, guinness also was playing a character who's rather weird interpretation of the rules caused him to lose sight of what was important in the situation nicholson was in. father brown's an entertaining fellow when he's solving mysteries and making the authorities look foolish. we've enjoyed brother cadfael do it in a medieval setting and american audiences liked father dowling played by tom bosley a few years back. this film should have stuck to being entertaining.

on the pure theatrical side, last stand was great, as the reenactments and soundtrack are very entertaining, but there are better accounts of this battle found elsewhere that, while not as long or as flashy, are far more historically comprehensive.certain little details, such as the misuse of the word "hoplon" for the greek hoplite shield and the mispronounciations of various names and words, really ate at me.my guess would be, that because "last stand of the 300" was aired the eve of the theatrical release of "300", the history channel was only trying to ride the coattails of the movie's hype.if you're looking for a depiction that's historically accurate in all respects possible, you'd have better luck elsewhere.

fred astaire is reteamed with rita hayworth one year after their big hit for columbia, "you'll never get rich". that was the movie which put hayworth on the hollywood map, yet her performance in this wan romantic musical hardly gives a suggestion why she was so suddenly popular. down buenos aires way, a tyrannical hotel owner demands that his four daughters marry in order of age; one may think film takes place in the 18th century, but no, it's modern-day 1942. astaire is an ex-hoofer-turned-gambler who goes back to dancing to earn some money, getting mixed up in impersonating a letter-writing admirer to hayworth's stone-cold society beauty. fred gazes at rita with a brotherly smile, but she's so mannequin-like (lip-synching to her songs like a wide-eyed wind-up doll) that all romantic sparks quickly sputter. they do dance together quite comfortably, however, and the jerome kern score is unmemorable but not too bad. ** from ****

the price of a dream - and some dreams can be "too" expensive.only having viewed the english-translated version, it is perhaps the reason for a low rating from this viewer.it made the overall film poorer than the story material hinted at......and other comments seem to suggest the subtitled version would be better.but some plot elements remained unexplained, leaving an unfinished feel.it also leaves the thought "is there a series to follow?".a pity there was no more (at this stage at least, anyway).

how do i describe the horrors?!!! first, some points: first, this review should be taken with a grain of salt -- i saw this over 20 years ago, when i was a boy, at the museum of modern art in new york city.secondly, i am giving away some scenes and plot points. however, it does not have much of a plot.finally, i don't enjoy these type of art films anyway.this film was directed by proto-auteur luis bunuel. he was a surrealist and dadaist. these were modernist themes or movements popular critically in the 1920's and early 1930's. surealism was the school of art that made things hyper-real, yet often had freudian symbolism. dadaism is based on what is supposedly the first word made by an infant -- dada, or father.made in black and white, it was also made by a band of communists (or as they preferred the term, socialists). bunuel and his group of fellow film-makers and artistes had been working on a number of symbolic ideas and issues in spain and france between the world wars.dadaism and surrealism influenced a lot of artists -- the police (doo doo doo da), poet arthur rambaud, edvard munch (the scream), rene magritte (floating hats in space), salvador dali (melting clocks), and even hitchcock (psycho). no norman rockwell.here's what i recall most about this film: a girl meets up with a cow; her eye gets slashed by a razor; clownish men cavort in a meadow. there is not, as i said, much of a plot, but then again, that must be the point.this was attacked as porn back then, and would be again today. one of the trade-marks of surrealism is a significant anti-feminism.

ok, it's a piece of historical film making that caused an uproar, shocked people, and was banned. i'll give it that, which is why i gave it a 3 rather than a 1. it may have been ahead of the times, but it's certainly way behind the times now. i am a big fan of salvador dali and i loved un chien andalou. that short was captivating with one creative scene after another. l'age d'or was way too long and dull - just a self-indulgent piece of pompous film making created simply as a feeble attempt to try to out-do un chien andalou by creating a full- length movie (and shamelessly leverage dali's name and fame even though he had little to do with it). total junk except for a (very) few shots of "shocking scenes" separated by long stretches of boring non-action. a waste of time and money. both of my thumbs are down, way down. it'll go onto my shelf never to be watched again.

when something can be anything you want it to be or mean, it's bound to register with someone as being rather special. but just as the shape of a cloud in the sky may appear to one of us or remind us of a battleship, and to another of his aunt's rear, and yet to another absolutely nothing other than a cloud, this does not make this cloud meaningful except for the viewers' interpretation. anyone who might find throwing a stuffed giraffe out of a window brilliant, or worthwhile for that matter, without relating it in some context, is possibly merely trying to impress us with his or her intellectuality.submitting to this movie as the dreams of a madman does quite nicely, especially since there is no standard or expectation for what said dreams would be like, and even if we were mad ourselves, this would hardly give us sane reference points for comparison. a love affair with this movie entails the same risk as seriously interpreting nostradamus. whatever real meaning was being conveyed at the time might be buried in the private jokes, musings, or provincial minutiae of its day, and to a select few radical intellectuals at that! i did spot a bit of an agenda even with my limited capacity though.the movie is definitely anti-fascist and to some extent anti-italian. i noted that although the years 1929-30 were years of great public works and urban renewal in italy, any indication of this seemed avoided. furthermore, (avant-guarde academic spinners take note of this for your next class) the very short cropped haired man with the mustache in the party segment near the end is a caricature of victor emmanuel iii and his tall female companion none other than queen helen, formerly princess of montenegro. without an understanding of potential historical relevance, even the apparent irrelevance is beyond the competence of academic or other intellectual poseurs who would bask in irrelevance to impress us.i gladly add my own paint buckets to the defacement of this cinematic joke. but in an adaptation of the famous mot by the little boy; the movie really has no face (to deface). paint would help it burn though.

the man (gaston modot) and the young girl (lya lys) go through the film consumed by passion for each other. they long to be together but their moments together are constantly interrupted. the film is strewn together with imagery and comes to a halt after an hour.........do the lovers find happiness....?..the film starts interestingly with footage of scorpions but you soon realize that its all a pretentious piece of nonsense. it's made as a silent film with occasional dialogue and it has a non-stop soundtrack playing that at one point is so irritating that you will turn the sound down and want to watch it as a silent film. the continuous drum rolls must have driven cinema audiences mad. there are some genuinely funny moments, eg, when the man kicks a dog and when he knocks over a blind man. unfortunately, this humour is carried out in the name of art so its just pseudo nonsense. the film is crap.

i'm a big fan of surrealist art, but this film by bunuel (with some ideas from dali) left me cold. bunuel had a life-long grudge against the catholic church and delighted in trying to offend catholics in fairly silly ways. this is one of the silliest; almost like what you'd expect from a smart-aleck 18-year-old in film class. the last few minutes of the movie, which have nothing to do with anything else, are a final nose-thumbing at religion.if you read the "scholars" regarding this slow-paced, occasionally amusing film, it's all about how the church and society are guilty of sexual repression. if that is indeed the point, then bunuel expresses it in the most roundabout fashion possible. the central male character is a nasty brute who loves kicking dogs and knocking blind men down in the street, and who mentally turns billboard ads into strange sexual fantasies. is this behavior the church's fault (for interrupting his lovemaking), or is he just a jerk? i vote for the latter. i think bunuel must have had a lot of personal hangups and chose the catholics as the ones to blame.there are a few moments where you might cry, "aha! surrealism!": a cow in a bed, a giraffe falling out a window (a poor model), a man shredding a feather pillow, a woman flushing a toilet while we watch pictures of seething lava (or a mud pit...hard to tell in b/w). the rest is forgettable self-indulgence. unfortunately, bunuel was still chasing the same bogey-men through the rest of his career (viridiana, discreet charm...). if you're interested in seeing surrealism on the screen, check out jean cocteau's early work.

a man kicks a dog 2' in the air.a woman kicks a cow out of her bed.a man kicks a violin down the sidewalk.a woman sucks on a statue's toe for 15 seconds.a man kicks a blind man in the stomach.jesus rapes a young girl.there you have it. i just saved you an hour of your life. surely there are those to whom this "shocking vanguard of cinematic expression" would appeal. but i found it no different from the puerile, disconnected videos i used to shoot with my friends in the 9th grade. except we never had a real cow.having heard endless sermons from beard-stroking art connaisseurs of how this is such an important film, i thought it would be worth my time. make no mistake, this is crap. if i hear one more person call buñuel the "father of cinematic surrealism", i think i'm going to punch someone. if anything, he issued a major step backward from the surrealist beginnings pioneered by his seniors fritz lang (metropolis), f.w. murnau (faust) and robert weine (caligari) 10 years earlier. this made a joke out of the whole thing, as if buñuel didn't have the confidence to truly embrace the art sans sarcasm, sans l'absurdité. it would take buñuel another 40 years before he would refine his style into something admirable. skip the early stuff and hop straight to 1970 if you want to be more impressed by his work.i'm sure he would agree. in 1977, buñuel himself stated that he would happily burn all the prints of his old movies. in this case i would be happy to pour the lighter fluid.

some movies you'll watch because they touch your soul or challenge you in ways that grow.some you'll watch because you want to be exposed to adventure or shock outside your experience; these won't directly feed you, but they'll help you situate yourself in a larger world than you otherwise would have. and after all, the hard parts of life are in what you choose not to accept.and then there are movies that do neither of these things, that you will watch out of obligation, or because you have a need for historical context. these are pretty worthless experiences in terms of building a life.the problem is of course that often you don't know which of the three a film will be, going in. you might get some indication from people you trust, but because a life in film is so personal, you really won't know until you go on the blind date.for me, this was pretty worthless. yes, yes, i know for many bunuel is the epitome of the sublime and rich. and you should know (if you don't) that among my greatest film experiences are some very strange films, very strange indeed.it isn't that this isn't cinematic, or symbolically deep, or apolitically/politically friendly to the way i think. its how it gets there that is off base. its the deviance from real deviance that annoys me.part of the problem is that this is successful alternative art, which means that it is successful commercial art. which in turn means that it can be simply explained and the explanation is not only widely acceptable but simply coded in shorthand. surely all this is true.when the term "surreal" is used, generally it is used incorrectly to denote any film image or world that differs from reality or seems strange. but when it is used correctly, meaning according to consensus theory, it always revolves around bunuel, and in particular this film and the one he genuinely did with dali. so because they invented surreal cinema, they define and control the term. that by itself chafes me, and i have my own alternative definition that doesn't come from their philosophy.its because the philosophy is wholly contrary. it isn't a philosophy at all but a rejection of philosophy, an anti-order. its packaged anarchy, carefully selecting the things that they use and the things they oppose without clearly differentiating them.so okay: against linearity, against narrative, against history, against religion (an easy one), against deliberate love. but for an illinear linear narrative, for establishing its own history (celebrated by countless film school professors; what else can they do?); for a sort of transcendent "accidental" love.it is its own enemy. if there were a bunuel alive today as he sold his image, the first thing he would do is attack the church or the surreal.my regular readers know that in nearly all matters cinematic, i cleave to the spanish and avoid the french. but in the matter of the surreal, i'd like to you consider the reverse: get your surrealism from alfred jarry, not bunuel.ted's evaluation -- 2 of 3: has some interesting elements.

sorry randy. i love your comedy but in this case you really laid a 'golden turkey' egg.the plot was thinner than a single layer of my skin, the acting more wooden than a giant redwood and i think the direction was non existent.there certainly appeared to be pathetic attempts at take-offs of other films, jaws and european vacation to name but two.if memory serves me right eric idle played the same type of character in nat lamp european vacation, but much better.i am wondering if chevy chase and beverley d'angelo were approached to make this sequel. if so, they certainly knew what they were doing when they turned their parts down.in my opinion no one can better chevy and beverley in their roles as the griswolds and randy quaid complemented them admirably in the earlier movies.randy quaid should have quit national lampoon whilst he was ahead.

makes the fourth theatrical release (the one national lampoon took its name off of) look like a comedy classic. a complete mistake and a sad attempt to capitalize on a once-proud franchise. painfully unfunny and unwatchable...even for a tv movie! the cousin eddie character has become progressively less amusing, from the original vacation when it was fresh and unique, through christmas vacation when it was starting to wear a bit thin, to vegas vacation where it was actually annoying to see come on-screen (but, in fairness, there were a lot of things that were annoying to see come on-screen in that movie!). but this attempt to move the character up to lead status is unfortunate to say the least. the vacation movies themselves met an ugly death in las vegas, and this hope at reviving even the thinnest thread of the series for television was thoroughly misguided. chevy chase and company put together a great trilogy back when he was in his prime; now let's just pull the plug and let the title rest in peace. (one tiny note of interest: the original audrey griswold--dana barron, the first of four actresses to play the part, including juliette lewis--returns to the role 20 years later! one is left only to wonder...why?)

when i found out there was a christmas vacation 2, i couldn't wait to buy the dvd. i sent off my money and watched it as soon as it came through the letter box. i love all the national lampoons films with chevy chase in it, and i bet he was glad he wasn't in this one!. i couldn't believe how bad this was, you would think it was impossible not to laugh at a national lampoons film, but believe me it is! . this film probably looked like a good idea on paper having cousin eddie as the main character, he started to get on my nerves from early on in the film, and became totally unfunny by the middle of the film, and by the end of the film i had gone brain dead and couldn't remember what had happened! .

national lampoon's christmas vacation 2: cousin eddie's island adventure (2003) randy quaid, miriam flynn, dana barron, jake thomas, sung hi lee, eric idle, fred willard, ed asner, d: nick marck. embarrassing direct-to-video flop has oafish cousin eddie and family on an expenses-paid vacation to the south pacific by his boss, hoping the dunce won't sue his company after being bitten by a smarter lab monkey! idiotic spin off can't measure up to any of the vacation films (even european vacation!), with a question of whether or not the filmmakers thought the script was actually funny. not even quaid, willard, or asner can make it remotely watchable. 83 min., not rated. *

i saw this movie last night at the berlinale as part of the competition. it was billed as the "world premiere" of the movie by the host (though it seems that people here have seen it previously). i have to say, i still don't really know what to make of the movie. i am unfamiliar with the book, purchased the ticket only two hours beforehand and had only limited knowledge of the plot. not enough, as it seems, as i had problems getting into the movie. the movie is sometimes being narrated by jones' character but somehow that perspective did not fit for me. and i really cannot say if some of the laughs the movie got were calculated or not. the cuts were abrupt and disruptive, the scenes seemed somehow slapped together and the storytelling did not always make sense right away (even leaving out the supernatural parts) - the actors were really good but could not really save the movie somehow. it was entertaining but sometimes only in the sense that i sat there thinking about technical details of movie making and what went wrong with this one. i still do not know what kind of mood the director intended the movie to have. it was a strange mix of light, dark, supernatural. it sadly did not draw me in at all and i rather watched it with a technical eye. but thinking about what is wrong with a movie while watching it is the best sign that a movie somehow has failed. i would have definitely expected something else with these actors involved...too bad!

i have to be honest and admit that this movie did basically nothing for me except baffle me completely. it's burdened with a plot that revolves around the mysterious murders of several young women, which then gets linked to the discovery of a body over 40 years old. the story never really seems to make much sense, especially when robicheaux (played by tommy lee jones) starts having his conversations with confederate general john bell hood (i never really did figure that out.) jones was ok in his role, although i thought he was really starting to show his age here. horribly miscast was john goodman as julie "baby feet" balboni, who i guess is supposed to be some sort of local mob figure. i simply didn't think goodman worked in this role, although i'll admit that just could be because i'm not much of a john goodman fan. somewhere in the mix appeared justina machado as an fbi agent, although i never really did understand what the fbi was involved in, which could mean simply that my attention kept wandering from the screen. if it was explained, though, i missed it completely. fortunately, this is a fairly short movie, so you won't waste too much of your life on it. 2/10

if you've ever listened to any of the james lee burke books on tape or cd and the reader was will patton you may agree with me that will is the personification of dave r.tommy lee jones is a native texan (or so i've heard) and no one portrays a texan better imho, but he's not a cajun. his delivery is all wrong. i lived in the state for several years and i can still hear the strange patois that a louisiana accent contains. tlj doesn't have anything like that.i thought marry steenbergen was a good choice for bootsy, but i missed seeing cletus (who will be cast in this role? the rock? mickey rourke? whoever, he'll have to be big).overall, i thought the movie was only a 4 - the plot flopped around like a fish out of water and didn't have the normal interesting, yet non-linear continuity that the book typically has.hopefully, hollywood will try another jlb book, "last car to elysican fields" would be a good choice. we'd get to see some of the best villains from jlb ever.

this is a disappointing adaptation of the james lee burke novel "in the electric mist of the confederate dead". it is rather poorly acted mainly due to the miscasting of the principal players. tommy lee jones, a normally fine actor, just doesn't capture burke's "dave robicheaux". as robicheaux's main nemesis, john goodman does a sloppy job as the "heavy". the guy who plays robicheaux's actor-buddy doesn't look like a former "a" lister leading man. the rest of the movie is mainly cast with no-name locals who just don't do justice to a big-time novel.the movie and jones' performance is way too hurried for one thing. robicheaux in burke's series of novels, gives one the feeling that he fits well into his environment most of the time, being laid back and slow-moving. this is just like the deep south and southern louisiana. then at times robicheaux is nearly manic in his exertions. jones just moves at a fast pace through the whole movie. he doesn't vary. ned beatty is wasted. mary steenburgen is out of place. about the only good thing about this is the setting. on the whole the movie gives one the impression of a tv movie.

i've read all the dave robicheaux novels and consider james lee burke to be my favorite contemporary fiction writer. i've also visited new iberia and much of acadiana to be able to better visualize the setting in most of these books. needless to say, i greatly anticipated seeing "in the electric mist," especially since i thought tommy lee jones would be terrific as robicheaux.i was greatly disappointed. the story was very choppy; the interplay with the "ghosts of confederate dead" was shallow and lost the impact and nobility it added to the book; and tommy lee jones was doleful, expressionless and difficult to understand as dr. the best way to describe this forgettable film is to add my "ditto" to an earlier user comment that this movie was like one of those old made-for-tv movies. i expected jill st. john or cameron mitchell to show up at any time.the location settings were accurate, and the photography at times captured the essence of the steamy bayous, smoky juke joints and eerie above-ground graveyards of south louisiana. too bad the story's disjointed presentation and tommy lee's sub-par performance interfered with the unique mood and spicy zest of the region.next to final comment: in the novels, dave robicheaux's nickname is "streak," because of the distinct streak of silver-gray hair on one side of his head. (similar to how the sopranos' paulie walnuts would appear if he were seen only in profile.) tommy lee had no such streak in this film, probably because the editors are james lee burke fans and they airbrushed the streak out after witnessing mr. jones's poor imitation of dave robicheaux.final comment: while i generally find alec baldwin to be pompous and obnoxious in most roles, he was by far a better robicheaux in "heaven's prisoners" than tommy lee was in "in the electric mist." also, heaven's prisoners is much more interesting and exciting, with uniformly believable performances and more evocative atmosphere than this new movie."in the electric mist" is okay to watch when one feels like "veging out" and there's nothing better on tv. but then, so are infomercials.

i have read and enjoyed many of james lee burke's robicheaux mysteries. when i read 'in the electric mist with the confederate dead' was being filmed and tommy lee jones was playing the lead, i was thrilled. after watching it last night, i ending up turning it off with about twenty minutes left, not wanting to see any more people shot or beaten up. don't get me wrong, i don't mind blood and gore-i love 'the untouchables' and 'the godfather trilogy'. perhaps it was just that i had previously seen 'birth' and 'what just happened' before watching this. i know that burke's books are violent, lyrical, and especially in the case of 'in the electric mist', can be like the cajun swamps he writes about, full of things that are never fully explained. in a book, that's fine. in a film, that's confusing. many of the previous reviewers are also ardent admirers of dave robicheaux, which makes it more understandable that they really liked the movie. or they are admirers of bernard tavernier or both. even as a fan of all the actors (and especially vince), i felt it was such a waste of their talents overall-they gave good performances in a film that didn't hold together. now, i say this, having only seen the usa dvd and hoping that tavernier's cut will make a huge difference. on the plus side: the soundtrack was wonderful. the scenes at robicheaux's place were perfect-just as i imagined the bait shop to look like. mary steenburgen was excellent as bootsie, as was walter breaux as batist. if you read the books, you know why robicheaux is an even-tempered person in the beginning of the film, and then starts whacking people with various instruments. overall, i wish that they had filmed more of the 'electric mist and the confederate dead' and left out large portions of robicheaux's methods of interrogation, explaining elrod's gifts and his bond to dave, as well as dave's to the general. then i wouldn't be feeling today as i did last night when i turned it off, "what just happened?"

it's boring.it's slow.where are the nasty and brutal murders? where is the tension that is supposed to scare us? this is like watching sesame street without the funny characters of ernie and bert or grover.it's really lame.maybe it was the writing...maybe the direction...maybe the acting, maybe the editing, maybe the cinematography, maybe the special effects, maybe the makeup.maybe all of the above brought this to something barely able to keep your eyes focused on.i wanted to get scared...not bored.this didn't scare me...it didn't even interest me...i had more fun watching the time on the microwave instead of watching this film.don't bother to buy it..and if you see it on television by some freak chance, there is no need to tuck the kids asleep.

it's hard to believe that a movie this bad could actually be released. the dialog was unnatural. especially poor was the portrayal of the relationship between the boy and his future step-father. i guess you could say that they succeeded in producing awkward dialog, but what was said seemed false and artificial. the suspense just wasn't there. the music was about as bad as it gets. the only reason i watched this movie was because i live in the death valley area and was curious about what locations would show up on the screen. fortunately the movie was on tv and so i didn't waste any money renting this sorry excuse for a film! i honestly believe that most amateurs could put together a more captivating plot than was presented here. it's too bad that the time of an entire film crew was wasted on such trash! i guess the only positive thing i can say about the movie is that some of the scenery was good.

nice movie and nicholle tom does a fantastic job playing the "guy in the girl's body", she really does it well.a sort of teen version of many other movies, but well done.well casted, from "matt" to "matt2".

i fail to understand why anyone would allow a sub-par director to put drivel like this onto celluloid. this movie has already been made at least two other times that were better than this ("here comes mr. jordan" - 1941, and "heaven can wait" - 1978). the only saving factor for figure skating fans might have been some nice ice skating done by a professional cast of skaters, but this just does not happen. the closest thing the audience sees to good skating is when tara lipinski's character takes a turn on the ice for a just a moment. others like nancy kerrigan and elvis stojko are hidden in the background and do not do any figure skating at all. there is not much real emotion shown, and there is not really any reason to tune in to this obviously made-for-tv movie. my advice: rent the original.

!!! spoiler alert!!!the point is, though, that i didn't think this film had an ending to spoil... i only started watching it in the middle, after matt had gotten into sarah's body, but then i became fascinated by the bizarreness of the plot, even for a channel 5 movie... and couldn't possibly see how matt wld end up happy. what about his fiancee? at one stage looked like he was gonna get with his best friend, surely icky and wrong... and then the whole 'oggi oggi oggi' thing does not work as a touching buddy-buddy catchphrase, tis just ridiculous... so was going 'surely he can't just come back to life? and yet how can he live as a woman?' and then the film just got over that by ending and not explaining anything at all!!!!! what's that about??? i was so cross, wasted a whole hour of my life for no reason at all!!! :) but was one of the funniest films i've ever seen, so, swings and roundabouts

this film has possibly, the worst title for a stooge short ever dreamed up. somewhat fitting, given the actual fifteen minute content.i can do without any of the "shemp a.d." stuff, but i will admit to having a few lol moments from the two-man comedy offered by moe and larry in some of the new footage (and kudos to those guys for trying to give it their all, considering the position they were forced into in even making these dogs).another bright spot to this and the last a.d. debacle "commotion on the ocean" is the decided lack of screen time for joe palma and the back of his head. no attempts to have him speak or flap his arms like a chicken(see "hot stuff"), may be worth an extra rating point.2/10

this series, made for televisión española (tve) is basically a series of chapters in the life of an ordinary family in 1968, primarily as seen through the eyes of the youngest son.based on a background of historical events, such as the may 1968 student uprising in france, the decaying franco regime, the war in viet-nam, the rise of imperialism, and others specifically related to spanish life at that particular moment, one might regard this series as a simple compilation of characteristic foibles which make themselves so apparent in this kind of entertainment.generally treated in a lightweight vein though not lacking in certain moments which might be called dramatic, the series would seem to be aimed at people of around fifty who can rember those times, as, it should be stated, anyone younger either chooses to ignore such happenings or is busily occupied in other things.the best thing that can be said of this series is ana duato's rôle as mother of three children: she plays the part of the total housewife of the times really well, manifesting that peculiar spanish penchant, especially noticeable among women, of letting all her thinking and her doings be carried forward by the impetus of her heart, without any resorting to the use of the brain. as we say in spain, common sense is one of the least common senses. imanol arias offers very little, apart from not being his usual stereotyped hard policeman as in other television series. indeed, as an actor, he should not be trusted in anything which is not a tv series. his resources are too limited; however, his part as father of the working-class household is not at all bad.not really recommendable for other audiences, even spanish-speakers in latin america: the themes are all too parochially related to a specific spot in contemporary spanish history, such that if the viewer was not living here at that time he will miss most of the references. it is even probable that certain situations which cause a few spanish smiles would not mean anything to other viewers.

you thought after "traumschiff surprise" that german comedy can't get worse? it can. this comedy is yet another attempt at perpetuating stereotypes of gay men masked as a nice comedy. the initial concept (openly gay men in soccer sports) would have been a great opportunity to erase some stereotypes, but... the real intended message of the movie seems to be in what way gay men are oh-so-different from straight men. absolutely silly, of course. even gay sex is treated as being of less value than straight sex. this movie only tries to serve straight audiences wanting to laugh about stereotypical gay men. well, don't waste your time on german comedy movies!

when i went to see this movie it was already a forced choice, as my original intent was sold out. what ensuited then was sheer terror, this movie is so bad i could hardly bear it. the story is not worth mention, a gay goalkeeper forms a gay soccer team to play against his old straight team who - on discovering his sexual orientation - gave him a hard time. loaded with unbearably old and overused clichés of gays, the thin plot matches perfectly the inane dialogues... it is absolutely astonishing that actors as dietmar bär or charly hübner waste their talent and time on such nonsense. 1/10

stumbled over this film on amazon.com. had never heard of its release but the three reviews gave it five stars and rave reviews so being a lover of german movies i bought a copy...have to say that i was not impressed. the production values are cheap, the story is derivative, the characters are less than engaging and for a comedy it is surprisingly short on laughs.i wanted to like this but i just found it lackluster and dull. or maybe i expected more of independent german cinema than a gay spin on the full monty and a cast of stereotypes.there are bits in the film that make no sense at all, like one of the leather bear's trying to get ecki in a sling --like he'd even look at him twice? or the vengeful ex-wife turning up at the match but ending up cheering for her estranged gay husband? bunkum is not the word! well, at least it explains the movies uk title, i suppose...

as much as i hated the movie that this series follows i can at least says that zangief was amusing. the animated series is quite possibly one of the worst things ever produced. the animation is quite often inconsistent, although it does stay consistently bad. the shape of a characters face is even capable of drastically changing in the same shot. the script and voice acting also leave something to be desired since most of the cast seems about as talented as the cast of a third grade drama play. characters like cammy and dj are so forced into stereotypes of their nationalities that episodes containing them are almost physically painful to watch, not that the series isn't painful on a regular basis anyway. episode plots seem to strive to reach new levels of lame with every turn and are so full of plot holes it amazes me they had time to show commercials. truthfully, it amazes me anyone wold pay to advertise during the show. in addition to being a bad series it is an even worse adaptation of street fighter. many of the characters maintain the failed adaptations from the movie. examples include ken and ryu being idiot con men (even though ken is supposed to be rich), blanka being guiles friend charlie, and chun li being a reporter. it takes talent to take something as bad as the movie and make it worse.

i just get exited when the movie start(because i saw juliette lewis name on the screen).the script seemed very complicated first but as the movie continued, it became understandably clear.i concentrated well on it but the result was disappointing.because the object of sex used too much on the film unnecessarily and it seemed to me that the director ignore ones who has tendency upon opposite sex.in my opinion the well prepared script couldn't be embodied.as we look at the cast,the movie promises something in the beginning or i just expected too much... and finally the end...the end is so so much mediocre that i wouldn't expect.the main character cassandra wants to give message about having baby and how a baby can change a life,in my opinion that scene is the real disaster for the film. all in all the characters are funny and acted beautifully.but only cast can't save a movie.

i have not seen and heard the original version.i am no russian, but i am learning right now.i also have no preferences for russia, bulgaia, the us etc.but what i have to mention is:in the german synchronisation in the whole film all russians speak with russian accent. americans talk "hochdeutsch" (without accent)! i have never heard such a stupidity! besides, this is boring.i hope the original is better.the rest is a simple thriller, not really good ideas. like a cheap version of a james bond film.

freddy forsyth has come up with a storyline which will suit the mood of the west's suspicions about putin's russia. forsyth installs a nasty guy as the ruski president who wants to return the country - not so much to stalin's communism but more to hitlerian fascism. in fact, his political manifesto could have come straight out of mein kampf rather than marx. and, the loon has the latest weapons of biological destruction to achieve the ethnic cleansing pogrom of the russian federation. american mercenaries connive with the russian prez to realise his fanatical, genocidal dream, but then enter dirty dancing's pat swayze...and,yep,things get really down and dirty. he's a former us operative-turned-drifter,jason monk, who is enlisted by the british government to see what the russians are up to. as a corny sidebar, swayze's character who is no monk (!)has sired a russian beauty elena (played by the gorgeous marta kondova) on his previous missions to the former commie state. hardman swayze does a passable job in setting out to defeat the evil russians. but young unknown actress marta kondova steals the flick as his nubile, 18-year-old russian daughter elena who helps dad root out the terror threatening her beloved mother russia.

the movie is complete disaster. i don't know who write scripts for movies like this one, but i would definitely love to meet one of them and talk to him a little bit. perhaps script writers really don't know sh*t about situation in foreign countries in present or recent past? or they just don't give a damn and write everything that they think it's interesting.a great and everlasting formula with mad dictator + 1 lonely hero (an american of course) might seem like a good idea, but come on?! we had such a tyrant in serbia (milosevic) who did a lot of bad things to it's people, but i simply can't imagine him yelling "shoot them, shoot them" with such a barbaric passion, like in medieval times. maybe they wanted to show how evil he was, but it was a stupid idea. much better impression would be if he just did it in cold blood, like the real monsters do.the list of nonsense is too long, but the funniest thing is: no matter how many national tv stations there are in russia, russian president watch american snn (cnn) news?? omfg!give me a break!burn this piece of rubish please!awful!

this is the perfect example of how a great book is turned into a poor film. the direction just gives the impression that the film was made up as they went along and patrick swaze is so wooden you can almost see the puppet strings on his body.spy vs spy films are not - or should not - be about car chases and shootings, the bad guys in this movies are really bad shots and miss the main characters even when at point blank range.even the action shots are just a cliché with the usual mounting sidewalks and crashing through tables and chairs - yawn.i got half way through and switched off - completely bored.

i just finished reading forsyth's novel 'icon'. i thought it was one of the most in depth, detailed, and page-turning books i ever read, definitely in my top 10. i acquired a dvd version of the book starring mr. swayze. ok, let me first point out that to fit a decent adaptation of the novel into 2.5 hours film time would of been impossible, so i understand the teams reason to sway from the book version and differ. however, when i say "differ" what i really should say is "take the characters from the book, add a few, leave a few out, take away the book's plot, add a modern new plot, add frederick forsyth's name in there somewhere". im not saying this was a bad picture, far from it, some of the effects were top notch and the acting wasn't half bad. the story sucked and didn't rely on logic or reality. forsyth's novel was so good and real and altered the facts of reality instead of exaggerating them.. this could of been so much more if it had taken its time and been made into say a 10 part series. if you haven't read the book then expect a decent tv movie with a good acting cast, if you have read the book then try and forget it when watching this.

i had just finished reading the book, and was really looking forward to seeing this tv adaptation which was broadcast on the hallmark channel on monday night (5/30/05). the key to the whole book was the manifesto which was stolen by the man with steel teeth, but i watched for an hour (out of 3 1/2) and i saw the man with the steel teeth but i never saw him steal a manifesto. i saw someone steal some virus but what did that have to do with the book? it's too bad because this film had great production values and a good cast, but isn't the idea of turning a book into a movie (tv or film) to get the people who read the book to be part of the audience. they only kept me for an hour. i thought the premise of the book was great and what did they do but throw out the whole premise. this book had a great mcguffin (to paraphrase hitchcock) but they ignored it. and it said in the titles that forsyth was involved in the production. they sure must have paid him a lot of money.

frederick forsyth's books are always so intricately plotted, with twists and turns, and usually a great surprise ending. this adaptation had none of that.so much of what was great in the book (the history of monk and the betrayed agents; the plot to influence the outcome of the russian election) were completely missing in this adaptation. instead, there's this completely new plot about bio-weapons that was a yawner.forsyth's protagonists always operated in the shadows, forever just slightly beyond the reach of the antagonists. the joys of his books have always been the machinations of carrying out their mission. this film resigned itself to gunfights and car chases early on.swayze's monk might as well have hung a sign around his neck saying "i am a secret agent" for all the attention that he called to himself during the film. and with all of that attention, the amount of time that it took the bad guys to catch up to him was surprising.granted there was some energy to this film, which is why i'm giving it a "3" instead of a "1". it was also great to see some underutilized pros like patrick bergin, ben cross, michael york, and barry morse.i hope that someday, someone will once again do justice to a forsyth film adaptation like "day of the jackal" did.

stan laurel and oliver hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history, and deservedly so, so i am happy to see any of their films. ollie is recovering from a broken leg in hospital, and with nothing else to do, stan decides to visit him, and take him some boiled eggs and nuts, instead of candy. chaos begins with stan curiously pulling ollie's leg cast string, and manages to push the doctor (billy gilbert) out the window, clinging on to it, getting ollie strung up to the ceiling. when the situation calms down, stan gets ollie's clothes, as the doctor wants them both to leave, and he also manages to sit on a syringe, accidentally left by the nurse, filled with a sleeping drug, which comes into effect while he is driving (which you can tell is done with a car in front of a large screen. filled with some likable slapstick and not too bad (although repetitive and a little predictable) classic comedy, it isn't great, but it's a black and white film worth looking at. stan laurel and oliver hardy were number 7 on the comedians' comedian. okay!

this is an alright show to watch, its not the best nor the worst. i've watched it for a long time and i don't like any of the new stuff. this show has changed into some teen trash and is living much differently. i dislike that crap..i have no iq why they completely changed the theme of this show. the first season was really enjoyable to watch and is was partly amusing. the 2nd season is just out of this world dumb. i seriously don't know why the writers/directors changed this show up. many more people liked the 1st season better than the 2nd and 3rd. i will only watch the first season of this show from now on, whenever i see a new episode, ill change the f*ckin channel...ya heard me! it gets a 3/10 because i somewhat enjoyed the 1st season but hated the 2nd and 3rd

this show is pretty alright and fun to watch, its a great disney channel shows and sometimes entertaining.i really enjoyed the first season but i hated the second and third seasons. this show has completely changed around. in the first season it was more about science and animals, all that is gone now in the season and third season. its more about her life and dating. ever since that gay kid (ben) came along, this show has sucked. the writers took a perfectly good kid show and changed it to a crappy teen comedy. disney took a turn for the worse. i cant stand to watch the newest episodes anymore, they're all garbage.

i think that it was just like lizzie mcguire except that it was a lot worse than the original. the only thing that is different is that she likes animals and science and all of that geeky stuff. everything else is the same. she likes a guy that she is too nervous to ask out. and later she finds a guy that does like her and she has no clue. i think that people need to quit making that same kind of shows. and another thing that is the same is that it is always thaw the friends are two girls and one guy. don't people think that these things get old and tired and these ideas keep being used over and over and yet they keep using these ideas. but i do know people who watch this show and i know that they like them.

when i first saw this show i thought to my self " what is this!!!!!?" its one of those shows where there is a perfect fake high school world with stupid problems that are considered "huge". then there's sadie. this complete misfit for her friends and well her family. shes completely obsessed with nature not that thats a bad thing but she compares high school students to animals! like what is that!? also they made her another lizzie miguire clone ( yeah because the world definitely needs another one of those!) shes also very perfect like most tv girls are which makes me sick! so please this is a stupid show it makes no sense just skip it unless you liked lizzie mcguire or any other shows like that.

naturally sadie is by far the worst show i have ever seen, it is such a piece of sh** and loaded with complete bullsh**. i didn't find any of the gags to be funny or somewhat clever, it was all awful jokes.the acting sucks, many of the characters sucked at acting, charlotte arnold (sadie) is such a terrible actor, the other characters suck too (magaret, rain, hal).the plot isn't unique and creative at all and the show is soo very much predictable. this is one of the worst shows made of all time, it shouldn't have even been made, the idiots who are responsible of writing this garbage should get fired (if they already didn't) the fist season was actually watchable but the second season was just a disaster, its too hard to watch this show, it is beyond awful.

when this show first came to disney, i love it started watching all the time. it quickly became one of my favorite disney shows ever but this show somehow transformed into something that is disturbing and disappointing.i do now find any of the second and third season fun, they seem like a re-watch of some teens shows. i hat that garbage. the first season was very unique because it showed sadie who loved science and animals and creatures. the first season was very entertaining. i mostly don't like the second season because of ben. he annoys me and pisses the crap outta me. the plot in the second season also sucks and is just awful

omg what has disney done lately..most of their new shows really suck. suite life of zach and cody are pretty good but other shows like cory in the house, wizards of waverly place suck and are unwatchable.naturally sadie is just beyond stupid and dumb. its about a teenager named sadie who likes science and grows up and goes through her everyday life. there are her friends margaret and rain and her older annoying brother hal. there all annoying and stupid. especially margaret who thinks she's the most popular girl in school and thinks she's soo pretty...its just beyond awful. i hate all the seasons of this show, its just terrible in every way (the first season was better though).if you value your life, you wouldn't watch this crap, its painful and stupid

every time i by pass this show on tv, i absolutely and truthfully want to claw my eyes out, and rip my ears off.it's so unbelievably horrible.the jokes aren't funny, the acting is completely terrible, and the whole entire show is one major disappointment.i hate charlotte arnold's guts, and i just want to punch her in the face or stab her with a knife every time i hear her talk. she is a no talent, low iq, big waste on society, and i think she would be doing the world a favor if she just shuts the f*ck up and went away for a long time. please, i say this with all my heart, do not even watch one episode of this show!!!!!!it's not even worth 30 minutes of your life, and there are thousands of better things to do, including killing yourself, than watch this show for half an hour.

naturally sadie sucks big time, i have no idea what the people were thinking about when they wrote this garbage. this is not funny, its not cute in any way shape or form, its just disturbing and a waste of money. sadie is such a bad actor. i lost all my brain cells watching this show, it honestly seemed that this show is forced, it was such a huge over hyped pile of crap.this show sucks.its a waste of time, and money, don't bother watching this garbage. the characters are so stupid and ridiculous. in the first season its just dumb and stupid then when i saw the second season i just couldn't take anymore, it made me want to kill charlotte arnold. the second season is juts absolutely a disgrace to disney this show is also a racist piece of sh**

the first time i saw a commercial for this show was when my sisters were watching the kim possible movie. the commercial showed sadie and her friend discussing the meaning of the word nothing.it is one of the stupidest commercials i've ever seen. basically, they go back and forth with lines like "nothing is a thing, so technically nothing is something,". when i saw that, i figured it would be yet another lame lizzie maguire knockoff by disney. but i had no idea how bad.fast forward about 3 weeks, when my sister turns on the t.v. naturally sadie happened to be on. what i saw had to be one of the most unintentionally funny shows i've ever seen. how'd it go? something like this:sadie, a vegetarian tree hugger, has an incredibly unhealthy,obsessive crush on the very monotone and poorly acted acted out owen. for some reason, her friend margret decides that owen needs to be "tested" to see if he is as good as he seems. what exactly do these tests involve? well, one thing they do is put a cockroach on her notebook. why? so that she can be squeamish and ask her monotone knight in shining armor to get it off.how is this a test? because if he squishes it, he's mean and uncaring and doesn't believe that bugs, as sadie puts it, "are innocent animals too,". they spread disease and pestilance! they deserve to be squished! but of course, owen just brushes it out the window, and sadie is still in love. but that's not all! margret says he needs to be challenged one more time, on something that "no guy can pass". this one involves shoving scarves down their pants( yes, you read that right)and walking buy him to see if he notices their large butts. predictably, he doesn't notice, and we see sadie in her bizarre and strange notebook world. sadie decides that she wants to be with owen forever,raise a family with him, and as she puts it, "live like wood ducks with their brood,". that's just plain wrong.bottom line: this is the strangest, most insane show i've watched. for those who like to make fun of dumb stuff, you'll love it. for anyone else, skip this show.

i do not find this show at all funny. i actually think it is much worse than any of the other terrible disney channel sit-coms right now. charlotte arnold is an interesting choice to play sadie, because she can't act. the jokes on this show are terribly unfunny, and it makes it even worse when the only cast member that has a little bit (and i mean little bit) of acting talent is justin bradley as sadie's brother hal. jasmine richards and michael d'ascenzo portray sadie's friends. there both really stupid and just terrible actors. two words that can really describe this show is terribly corny. it's corny humor that only little girls find funny because their brains have not developed yet. now i've explained my hatred for the acting and the horrible humor, what's next? the whole premise of the show is a stupid idea. she changed again (not so sciencey an ben-loving) and suddenly nobody recognizes her? it's moronic. in summation, i hate this show, however little girls who do not have a concept of funny will enjoy it, so i guess that's what they're going for over quality. although i can say as much as, the first season is clearly better than the second.bottom line: just don't watch any of it.my rating: awful show. tv g. 30 mins.

for those of us who are part of the real world of ballet - this film is completely ridiculous. ivan kirov was basically a gymnast, not a ballet dancer. viola essen at the time was with ballet theater, now american ballet theater, and a reasonably good dancer, but except for dame judith anderson, the acting is amateurish and checkov is completely over the top .... embarrassingly so! i saw this film at age 14 and at that time, never having seen a ballet, i was very impressed. however, later in life, long after i had completed my own career as a dancer - i purchased the video tape of it, curious as to what it was like after so many years. i couldn't believe how naive hollywood could be about the world of ballet. but it was made in the mid 40s, before the red shoes or the turning point, the latter giving a true picture of the ballet world. the entire cast of spectre have now passed away ... ivan kirov (not his real name)dying at age 79. it was his one and only film, thereafter being kept by a chicago business man .. so the rumor goes.

with actors like depardieu and richard it is really a hard task to make a dull movie. but weber is a master in setting a slow pace and making supposedly funny scenes without any wits and depth. this movie is high on story but low on character. you never get to know any of the characters except for superficial slapstick. unfortunately weber has no idea what slapstick is all about. his style could be described at hit and miss. of course some people laugh when they see someone slip on a banana peel. weber directs his humor at this lot. it is a shame how bad he uses good talent. many good french comedians have been wasted away by mediocre directors.

badly shot, badly edited, clumsy dialogue, flat characters, unsuccessful adaption of a novel. it doesn't really get much worse. decent acting and good popcorn saved me for this hour and a half - felt more like three hours - of boredom. occasional good one-liners.david is a dim-witted young man, who has never recovered from losing his brother at an early age. he puts his faith in a chinese philosophy mumbo jumbo video, although that doesn't seem to help him much in real life. david is a member of a debt-collectors gang, where every member has an iq below sea level. a lacking script, along with uncreative shooting and even worse editing, make what could have been quite funny incidents of failed debt-collecting look like a amateurish homemade reality show.david rents an apartment from an elementary school teacher, haraldur, who by dropping a couple of sentences about his own importance convinces david he is dealing with the most dangerous criminal in iceland. a severely lacking script doesn't offer david anything to base his opinion on. a couple of scenes showing haraldur doing something that david could have misinterpreted would have done the work. the potentials of film as media, as opposed to the text of the book this film is based on, are not exploited.at first, david's connection with haraldur raises his status within the debt-collectors gang, but the prevailing paranoia in the criminal world forces david to show where his loyalty lies.the plot of the film is fine, but then it is based on the book. this could have been a much better film. a good screenwriter could have made something of this material. sadly, that is not the case.the acting is generally good. pétur jóhann is excellent and credible as david. eggert þorleifsson doesn't get much to work with, but does his best with what little material he has. ingvar sigurðsson and michael imperioli (in a tiny role) manage alright.overall opinion: what could have been quite a funny and entertaining film about a dim-witted anti-hero in a debt-collectors gang, becomes a boring, badly-crafted film made after a poor manuscript. staring at your toes for an hour and a half would be more enjoyable.

i did have a good time the first 45 min. or so, but then suddenly it was all down hill. the suspense somewhat started to get thin and the jokes somewhat the same all over. what kept it going were the good actors.but the problem with this film is that it is trying to be cleverly funny,like tarantino and god is that outdated stuff. tarantino being a bit overrated sometimes, this movie comes ten years too late. at best it is for teenagers, and i am sure many of them find the character of johann funny, which he is for the first 30 min. the other problem i have with it is that the story fades away towards the end more and more, thou i tried to find a recovery point. maybe it didn't recover because the lack of passion comes with the effort of trying to be cleverly funny. also, like in many movies, sure, good actors who can afford it don't seem to demand a better dialogue, or just turn down the script.

i found this to be a watchable all be it very predictable movie. there was some good stunt work that gave a fair degree of excitement and suspense to the story. one did however have to suspend ones credulity on a number of occasions for the plot to work. for example despite losing their transfer cable, couplings and harness when the pilot retracted the undercarriage manually, they fortunately found a spare on-board the aircraft complete with caribbeans. according to the plot drilling a hole in the ceiling of the vault would disable the alarm system in the vault when the system was reactivated (i can't think why), according to daltry there battery operated drill would be unable to drill through the vault ceiling however they just happened to have a hydraulic drill complete with hoses and fittings to fit the equally convenient take off points in the planes hydraulic system located above the vault. as the plane has a closed hydraulic system it is hard to see how this could be accomplished without affecting the control systems or at least setting hydraulic pressure alarms in the cockpit. accepting this for the sake of the plot it takes them several minutes to drill a small hole through the top of the vault (tension will they be able to drill through before fed's get there to check the false alarm), yet from the time the vault door closed and before the fed's had walked the few feet to the second security door they had cut a squire hole in the roof of the vault big enough for them to get through. one can accept all theses and other inconsistencies for the sake of a good yarn, however what spoiled the movie for me was when what appears to have been an effort by the script writers to discuses what up to that point was a fairly predictable ending, they killed off the two hero's (if one can refer to crocks as hero's) ketchum & brooks one was shot and thrown out of a 747 at 10,000 feet the other wiliest sliding down the cable between the two planes the villain daltry with one hand manages to unhook the cable carrying the weight of a full grown man with the air pressure of several hundred miles per hour pressing on him, and letting him fall to his death. and yet in the next sequence these two without any kind of explanation (however tenuous or implausible) have miraculously survived the full from 10.000 feet and had time to set up an elaborate scam to get the money. the only comment on there survival was to sophie that her brother is a bad shot. don't expect an oscar nomination for this one.

the only reason any of the hundred or so users watched this movie was because they belong to the crew, were friends to the crew, or were obsessive fans of either lance henriksen or lorenzo lamas. i personally follow the "cult of lance", so i was disappointed to see that despite being the headliner, it's in name only. playing rich criminal newcastle, lance is a joy to watch but all of his screen time is relegated to the beginning of the movie. newcastle sets up a 747 heist which includes ketchum (lamas) and a bunch of forgettable characters. the biggest shock to this viewer was that the pre-heist scenes were not all that bad. with the exception of somewhat obnoxious and rather confused looking aviva gale, who times every line with the finesse of a grade school play actress, acting was decent all around, and none of the lines really made me cringe.but once the heist occurs, the movie falls asleep. not only is their plan the most ridiculous thing ever captured on film, but it's dragged out for far too long. this isn't a very deep movie, and you have to fill out your 90 minutes, but these scenes are so boring i nearly nodded off at two in the afternoon. one particular sequence in which we watch each and every one of the characters perform the same task over and over again is especially difficult to get through. the movie's name is "rapid exchange", but the exchange is far from rapid - it's overlong and bloated to extremes. perhaps it would have worked if any of the characters had real personalities, but come on, there's only so much you can ask out of a straight-to-video movie airing of showtime extreme.thankfully, there are several laughs, intentional and unintentional (lorenzo lamas is seemingly a master of disguise, which makes for a couple of incredibly bizarre scenarios), and lance returns in the film's end, albeit for a brief period of time. it's a bad movie, and i probably didn't have to tell you that myself, but it's far from the worst thing i've ever seen. i wouldn't put it too high on the list of henriksen films, since he's been in some real gems with greater screen time, and either way the movie loses a lot of steam once the heist begins, but the best thing i can say for rapid exchange is that the last two films i watched before it were the mainstream hostage and the overrated, pretentious crash - and this was better than both.

as a fan of henriksen (i liked him in the "millennium" series) and of course lorenzo "renegade" lamas, i had expected at least something from this film. sadly, the plot is predictable, the acting is bad and the computergraphics used for most stunts don't work out. sometimes it even looks like they've captured some shots from microsoft flight simulator.the cinematography sucks as well. unnecessary funky camerawork in the beginning only detracts (from the cheesy dialogue) and gives the film a cheap, made-for-video-look. it works in hiphop-movies and jet li movies, but seems out of place in this flick.i would have liked this film 10 years ago. i was 11 then.

i absolutely hated this movie. even though the movie wanted to transmit some kind of social message, it was done in such a cliché ridden and melodramatic way like a mexican soap opera.also the acting was terrible especially charityn and her son. that's one of the problems with dominican movies, they use celebrities that can't even act just to attract the masses. i'm even more ashamed about the positive reviews here which sadly means dominicans are just being condescending to what's done here instead of giving honest and critical opinions that will help our film industry base itself on quality.

nothing will ever top komodo with the lovely jill hennessey as a shrink (!), but kvc ain't quite as bad as i expected for a syfy channel quickie. just make sure to watch it while drunk or stoned, or while trying to go to sleep. the unimaginative title basically says it all: a group of mostly unknown actors converge on an island where a government experiment to grow giant vegetables has gone wrong. giant creatures that came into contact with the vegetables have taken over the island and eaten everyone. so now the government is preparing to blow up the island, regardless of the people being there. the acting is wonderfully atrocious, especially a mustachioed general right out of the incredible hulk tv series, but this is typical of this kind of made-for-cable schlock. the cgi creatures are tv-level quality, which means you know you're watching cartoon monsters. however, two of the gals in the group are very cute, and worth watching as they run here and there in their tight little outfits. you just want to eat them up!

when moviegoers hear two popular villains/characters will be fighting, they flock to the theaters to see how the battle will end. there's freddy vs. jason, in which two very popular horror icons try to kill each other. and, more similarly to this, there's godzilla vs. (insert name here). but the very generic komodo vs. python is just a horrible title, and an even worse premise. obviously, the movie's a d-list picture, but, at least come up with a more compelling name, maybe something that can trick the unsuspecting viewer into watching it. with a name like this, you know what you're getting in to.a group of military men/women, including a 20-something year old sexy scientist woman are left for dead by the military on an island inhabited by a giant komodo dragon. as long as they can make it off the island and to the boat, they'll be fine, but...no...there's a giant python guarding the ocean and the way off. let's hope all these guys can make it off the island, and that the python and komodo don't verse each other in some sort of horrible special effect battle.really, this movie is bad in almost every way. the acting is pretty bad, or maybe it's that the special effects are so cheesy, that the acting is unbelievable because no one believes that these people are in any danger with creatures that look like they were made on an early 90s computer. nonetheless, this movie is actually pretty funny. the creatures are so clunky looking, and the actors really give it their all pretending like they're in danger.i'd like to say that this movie is a steaming pile of sh*squawk!*...but i can't. this pg-13 rated film actually bleeps itself out. every time a curse word comes, a parrot noise beeps out the word. even words that can be said on network television. how *squawk*ing cheap that they bleep out words, and with a parrot no less. eventually these parrot noises got to me and i couldn't help but laugh at the incompetence.this movie is bad, from the silly beginning to the ridiculous night of the living dead style ending, but it's also kind of funny. as a horror movie it fails miserably, as an action movie, it fails slightly less, but still pretty bad, and as a comedy it shines.my rating: * out of ****. 95 mins. pg-13 for some violence and squawked out cursing.

another laughably lame and senseless low-budget sci-fi tv presentation but actually its kind of amusing kind of in a passably undemanding way. am i being soft? i don't know why they come up with these titles. yes there's a komodo. and yes there's a cobra. however what's the deal with 'versus' in between? sure they do come to blows in only two sequences (one recapping an incident and the other being the dodgy climax) and quite boring exchanges i might add. the get-up is the same old routine of a scientific experiment getting out of hand on a secluded island (no dinosaurs about), and some innocent bystanders (environmentalists hoping to expose animal testing) getting caught up in it. this sees a komodo dragon and cobra becoming massive in statue with the government soon wanting to destroy any sort of the evidence (including witnesses) of its existence by blowing up the island. so this leaves the survivors racing against time to find a way off. the prominent staples existed of awful video game cgi, hack script, few dingy sets (although the tropical island setting was easy on the eyes), throwaway characters (but i found the performances faired up), lifelessly tacky thrills (which for some reason kept using the same repetitive shot of the victim just standing there in terror which implied i'm waiting, please eat me now, i'm not going anywhere and eventually they were swallowed whole well almost as it seemed to always take a second gulp to finish them off or just save the hassle by stupidly squashing them) and a very hysterical edge with some sort of wretch message amongst the acts of survival. director jim wynorski seems to be on cruise control throughout. michael paré has fun with his gruff dialogues and michelle borth added much needed sparks. renee talbert is there to pout a lot, quite successfully too.

i just caught this on showtime...ewwwwwww, not even fun in a bad movie kind of way. one of the lamest monster flicks i've ever seen. plus the tv reporter in the movie was that annoying jerri from a past season of survivor. the only amusing thing was that the "secret base" was the house from fantasy island (and a million other movies and tv shows; the place is located in the l.a. area). i fully expected mr roarke and tattoo to come out and greet the visitors. if tattoo had gotten eaten by the snake, i might have given this movie a 2, but oh well. watching people stand there and scream for five minutes while the komodo or the cobra loomed over them instead of making a run for it was pretty funny, especially because you could really tell that they were just screaming at an empty spot where the computer animators would later paint in the monster. i nearly fell out of my chair, though, when in a flashback scene they brought in either the cobra or the komodo - then normal size - in some indestructible solid steel container with some air holes drilled into it. wouldn't a wire cage have sufficed? lol! guess they couldn't afford to rent a real komodo and cobra. i have to remember i rent showtime for their series and not their movies.

perhaps the wildest outlier in alfred hitchcock's career is this straight-out comedy vehicle by the director, pairing carole lombard with robert montgomery as a couple who discover a mistake has invalidated their marriage. where do they really stand with each other?contrary to what others say, there is an element of suspense here: the idea that these two miserable people might escape each other, free to inflict their awfulness on some other, undeserving mate.it's funny reading comments here about how miserable lombard's ann smith plays out in this film, because montgomery's role is as much of a heel. he manhandles ann, snaps at witnesses, short-shrifts clients - just the kind of lawyer who gives his profession a bad name. ann is overbearing, too, of course, the kind of wife who holds her husband hostage from work for six days over a petty squabble, bringing up things like what he did in paris when he was 20 and hadn't even met her yet. "i forgave you that!" she says, as if it was big of her.for david, a revoked marriage is an opportunity to have a little illicit pleasure with his "mistress" before tying the knot for good. for ann, it's an attempt at premarital sex that must be repelled with a bottle of champagne to the head, followed by expulsion from their apartment and her life.the acorn doesn't seem to fall far from the tree, as ann's mother is scandalized into apoplexy when she learns what david tried to pull: "oh my poor baby! thank heaven your father is dead!"that's a rare good line in this laughless, unlikeable comedy.you can call this an example of the "remarriage comedy", in which the bonds of matrimony are challenged in order to be reaffirmed. you can also call this an example of what roger ebert calls the "idiot plot", in which the storyline depends on the main characters acting like idiots. hitchcock seems to have a laugh at uptight american morality, but can't really do much more with it than a jokeless scene where an older couple is scandalized by the sound of loud plumbing.lombard died within a year of this film's release; it was the last film of hers she lived to see. what a shame it couldn't have been something better! she was overbearing in "my man godfrey", too, but in such a likable way you didn't just have to go with her, you wanted to. here she plays for laughs that aren't there while sadistically breaking david's chops again and again. montgomery rolls his eyes a lot like groucho, a study in smugitude.the only really decent thing in this movie that lasts more than a few seconds is gene raymond as david's law partner jeff custer, who makes a play for ann and acts with honor and decency. raymond underplays his many reaction shots, and even a drunk scene, all to good effect.***spoiler***so decent a guy is jeff that ann ends up rejecting him for not fighting david after she goads him into a confrontation, calling custer "a lump of jelly". jeff exits the scene, leaving ann and david together for their future murder-suicide. here's one custer that managed to escape a massacre!***spoiler end***

alfred hitchcock made this comedy of mis-marriage in 1941 but his heart doesn't appear to be in it. carole lombard and robert montgomery are the couple who discover they were never legally married and spend the movie bickering their way back to true love. it doesn't have much of a reputation and it is easy to see why. the jokes are familiar from better films but here they don't gel. and the leads are uncharismatic. lombard's performance is clipped and starchy and it's doubly sad to think she was dead only a year later. robert montgomery seems to know he's in a sow's ear and tries his damnest to make a silk purse out of it without much success. the best performance comes from gene raymond as 'the other man', (he has a lovely drunk scene). this is one of the few really bad hitchcock films.

i am astounded that so many people find this film even close to good. let me make it clear that i am a huge hitchcock fan and went out of my way to own as many of his films on video as i could but this one i felt was so below par not only for hitch's films - aw heck, i'm being far too nice here. this pictured really sucked. i don't care that hitch did a favor for the very talented carole lombard, but i have seen 50s sitcoms with more cleverness and style than this boring turkey. chemistry between lombard and robert montgomery? listne i like mashed potatoes and ice cream but i wouldn't want to taste them together. i have seen better chemistry in chemical spills on th highway than here.if you really love hitchcock, avoid this film and see any one of his better ones. for crying out loud, the bits hitch did on the old tv show were funnier than anything this film fails miserably to deliver.

hmmm, not a patch on the original from shaw brothers. the fighting is average and looks very clunky. the story line is as to be expected from a 70's kung fu film, confusing and daft. stupid voices for women,dubbed in posh english accents for men. i turned this off early and i love martial arts flicks. get the original, its so much better than this average movie, don't be fooled, i bought the wrong flick what i wanted was the shaw brothers movie. i have just started commenting, i'm only doing foreign and martial arts films this is just the beginning of my movie collection, i personally own most modern martial arts flicks. hope you don't waste time watching this one, its for die hard fans of 70's kung fu only.

ok, this movie wasn't good at all. video games aren't what i would brag on if i was over the age of 15. cool to play games, but writing a comment about video game players may like this movie for that it is, that is strange. just play a video game, don't make up a sorry story about getting trapped in one. i use my cell phone, i hope i don't loose my girlfriend in that. grease being the worst ever? ok, grease has a very well thought out story along with being a musical. even if you don't like musicals, anyone would say grease is good. my brother plays video games all the time and he watched 30 minutes and left because it was so awful. i feel asleep.

well, the first thing i saw after looking at the dvd box was "best screenplay" and thought this would be a good rental. wow, was i mistaken! i'm sure at one time there was a good movie in here, but after the incredibly poor acting and "video game" production values, this ends up looking like tron's retarded half-brother. the first scene sets up the overall atmosphere of the entire movie. five minutes into it, you'll be asking yourself, "what the hell am i watching?", and it will just snowball from there. an awful soundtrack that makes every song sound like rob zombie's "dragula" rounds out this miserable piece of crap into a laughably bad movie. on a side note, #3 most romantic quote in a movie - "i think you're the final destination."

having just watched acacia, i find that i have to agree with the negative reviews here. i like asian, and korean horror, and i had great expectations for this film. man, was i disappointed. watching this, i kept thinking "surely they just do this to catch me off guard later on", and for a while i expected something ingenious to happen. however, i slowly realised that the film really is that bad. it is the cheapest cash in into the asian horror market i have seen so far. the basic story is perhaps not even that bad, but the way it is filmed it seems like the most laughable plot ever. the tree as a 'scary' device might be okay if used cleverly, but all the filmmaker does is giving us different shots of...yes, a tree, over and over again. he seems to hope that the tree will do all the work for him in terms of tension and build-up, but it just feels like what it is: shots of a tree. for goodness' sake!slow build-ups can be very effective, and a film that presents the viewer with only few glimpses of what is wrong might deliver good scares, but not acacia. sure, we get a glimpse of a child on a tricycle disappearing around a corner, and, yet again, meaningful shots of the tree from above, or underneath, or the side, but these scenes are just not scary. they feel silly, especially because you realise that the director means them to be scary. they simply aren't. apart from that i agree with some of the other reviewers, that the characters are ridiculous. in particular the one character's 'descent into madness' is laughable. however, what really breaks acacia is the terrible editing. its hard to see why scenes were cut together the way they are, but it's bad, and it kills any spark of interrest it might have had. it also makes me feel patronised, because i can see what they are trying to achieve with it, but i cannot believe that they think i would fall for such cheap ploys.there are lots of great asian ghost films, and lots of bad ones, but this is by far the worst i have seen. they must have been going through the list of 'what to put into ghost movies', and ticked them all off, but in the end they forgot to add the actual movie.

no serious spoilers, but some very minor ones."acacia", a korean contribution to the ever popular asian horror wave, concerns a husband and wife who decide that they're getting on a bit and decide to adopt a child. the child, who has an usual obsession with the dead tree in the family's garden, eventually disappears when the couple eventually have a child of their own and the aforementioned tree seems to hold a grudge against the family itself.and that's about it. the film moves at a snails pace, clocking in at over 100 minutes with 80 minute material. it is essentially a thin family drama with a creepy tree, and there is very little in the way of scares, just shots of the tree with weird mumbling noises playing over the top. however, the idea of the tree being the child's mother is a pretty original one, but it isn't exactly exploited to its full potential. this sort of separates "acacia" from much of the new wave it belongs to: films like ju-on and ring tend to do the opposite, and milk bland ideas until they are red in the face.the film does begin to get going towards the end; however the realisation of the child's fate and the parent's actions not only dampen the earlier curiosity of the story, but are revealed with such machine gun editing that it's difficult to take in all at once. the final sequence is undoubtedly creepy, however it feels like too little too late.overall, the film does not feel too much like a ring cash in, however with the "film renaissance" that korea is currently going through, i couldn't help but feel this film could have been so much more.

this movie strayed too far from straub's novel for me to enjoy. barely made it to the middle of the film. besides changing don wanderly from edwards nephew into his son, the removed most of the major scenes and a number of characters that gave the novel so much life. what was left was trash. straub's version was far superior to this poorly executed film. i don't think casting did all that great a job on picking the chowder society members either. hopefully someone will come along and actually remake this film correctly in my lifetime. i just hate when hollywood butchers the works of talented authors because they think their version so much better. makes me sick.

maybe it's because i read peter straub's wonderful book before seeing the film, but i was terribly disappointed by this movie. in my opinion, the filmmakers removed everything that made the story interesting and unique, and replaced it with more common hollywood-style elements.it's too bad, too, since this movie has a terrific cast, particularly fred astaire, douglas fairbanks, jr., melvyn douglas, john houseman, and the then-largely-unknown alice krige. they're just not given very much worthwhile to do.in fact, i was all for leaving halfway through, but a friend convinced me to stay to the end, as he was sure it had to get better. he apologised to me during the closing credits.

this story had a good plot to it about four elderly men that share a deadly secret concerning a young woman that they met 50 years ago. after all this time, the young woman returns to seek revenge on the men. this story occasionally made me nod off during the movie in the middle of tiring elevator music and the ever so consistent thunder storms. but it is well worth the wait in the end when we find out just who the mystery woman is that keeps plaguing the old men in their dreams and interfering in a young man's life. the most of what i liked in this film was the suspense in which the young woman appears to the men just before their deaths. the special effects were something. every time i heard her call out to them i would think "not that face again." but it was a good movie, i just wish that the pace was not as slow or the acting not as tiresome. and what i also liked about the movie was the flashback of the 20's, very authentic as well as the costumes being original.

this film gives new meaning to the term "uneven", giving us a few intriguing characterizations offset by an awkwardly realized plot that relies on a few well-placed stingers to deliver the majority of the thrills.the plot concerns a group of men who harbor a secret that has caused a curse to be visited on them in the form of a ghostly female apparation that causes death. she also may be seducing their sons.it is quite a spectacle to have all the notable veteran actors together in one film, but unfortunately they're not very convincing, particularly the scene where melvyn douglas goes off the deep end begging the others to listen to him. it's no shock then that the actors who play these same characters in their youth are terrible, especially the giggling ricky. they deliver the worst "gee-aren't-we-all-drunk" scene i've ever watched.the movie has a few saving graces, namely dick smith's great ghost makeups (however misplaced they are in this film), and alice krige's fascinating performance as alma/eva. i've never read the novel that this film was taken from, but i intend to after reading some of the other reviews on this page. you don't have to have read the book, however, to realize that this is only a shadow of the original tale. there is a good story here, but it seems lost somewhere, amid exposition that shows the men having nightmares over and over again and making unsubtle references to the secret they all share. as it stands, it appears as if there was about half an hour of footage removed from this print, particularly near the climax. after all...how is it that fred astaire manages to mount an excavation of the pond so quickly? what did gregory bate and the kid have to do with eva? and while we're at it...what the hell was she, anyway? why did letting her out of the car cause the apparition to disappear? if it was an apparition, how could it have sex with two men and have them not know?these and other questions will never be answered, at least not by this film. unless some restored footage is discovered somewhere, it will probably forever remain a curiosity with some oozing makeup, bizarre sex scenes and nudity, and a few attractive performances.

this is another film i missed out on italian tv as a kid: notable for its quintet of ageing stars, most of whom had never made a horror film in their life (fred astaire, melvyn douglas, douglas fairbanks jr., john houseman and patricia neal), it deals with the men’s long-concealed past crime coming back to haunt them. it takes the form of a ghostly dead-ringer for the girl they all loved (alice krige) but whom they were forced to dispose of after an unfortunate incident when she humiliated their egos! fairbanks, who was the one responsible for the deed, has twin sons (craig wasson) and so krige directs her revenge upon them as well. soon one of the latter, fairbanks himself and even douglas and houseman all wind up dead. therefore, the remaining wasson and astaire decide to confront the ghost at the scene of the crime where they also have to contend with a couple of sinister tramps who somehow do krige’s bidding! i was looking forward to seeing these veterans on their last legs (douglas died before the film had even premiered though, by that time, he had already completed another role, while it proved astaire’s own inauspicious swan-song) but ghost story went through too many changes of mood – while maintaining a sluggish pace throughout and emerging overlong into the bargain – to be anything but a failed curio. having dollops of sex (including full-frontal nudity from wasson!) and gruesome make-up effects muddled the waters all the more and marred the old-fashioned elegance inherent in jack cardiff’s (another notable of long-standing) cinematography.

ghost story has an interesting feminist revenge tale premise, a-list veteran actors, colorful flashbacks with nifty look-a-like youthful counterparts of the old men. scary staccato music heralding the approaching horrors, atmospheric new england winter weather, and an excellent charismatic actress in the title role. ghost story could have been much more effective in black and white and in eliminating some of the more lurid special effects, and to presenting a more cogent screenplay (we should not have to be wondering about why the two trailer-parkish acolytes are in the script) the biggest detriment of the film is craig wassan (definitely separated at birth from bill maher) who from perhaps editing or just bad acting, is totally ineffective. he seems to "specialize" in wide-eyed, wide-mouthed reaction shots; not a lot of personality here. the revelation however is alice krige, pale-faced, enigmatic, terrifying underneath the placid exterior. however, her eva galli is creepy even before she meets her fate; i mean, a young woman who says things like "i'd like to take a bite out of you" or "dance with me, you little toad!" is already not in the land of the living. ghost story would have been much better in a low-key, val lewton mode. the overdone special effects completely undercut the chill factor.

all that talent.....but when ya have poor direction, and a weak screenplay, it doesnt matter who is in a movie. very tired attempt at telling a tale..which was actually interesting in the beginning, but then quickly fell apart toward the end....to bad.

i must not have seen the same movie as the one the comments refer to here. first, i think they should have serialized ghost story if they were going to film it at all. the truncated version they come up with was awful. i felt the performances were mannered and so much was left out of the story that the performances of such masters as astaire, douglas, houseman, and fairbanks seemed hammy. alice krige was superb as eva, though. craig wasson is a good actor but he was only adequate as the protagonist. the decision to cast patricia neal and to truncate her role was not a good one. imagine what anne bancroft would have done with that character! i blame the script, which was poor. the production values were dark and the pacing was slow. a disappointing, pedestrian effort.the book is one of the five greatest suspense/horror novels of the 20th century, imho. but the movie was disappointing, although a great introduction for krige.

i can't express enough just how bad this film was. first of all what a waste of some legendary stars although they are quite old and pretty unconvincing. fred astaire, well i guess he must have owed some one a big favor as this was his last film role. the script is a mess and the film seems terribly draggy. i imagine maybe if i saw this back when it came out (1981) i might have thought it was decent. however seeing so many actual good horror films, this was one of the worst. the only real convincing anything in this mess was the very young and lovely sort/of creepy alice krige. the main young character was trying to act the best he could but was utterly terrible. i wasn't sure how much of it was from his lack of skill or the lack of a comprehend-able script, but either way he was just plain bad. don't watch unless you want to see a bunch of old guys be somewhat scared.

the other boleyn girl - not to be confused with the book it claims to be based upon. this movie is not even close to a faithful adaptation. i could understand them changing or elaborating on a few things. the book is not perfection, but it was well-written and became very popular. i could understand if the bbc wanted to make this a little more faithful to what actually happened, who anne boleyn really was - but it's not even close to being historically accurate either. it's just fluff. mindless, made-up fluff. a real shame.to begin with, the writer and director seemed to think it was a good idea to setup the story like it was a reality tv show. seriously. they have the boleyns sitting in front of the camera, confessing how they really feel about what's happening in their lives. anne boleyn sits in a confessional (not the church kind, the real world kind) and chooses what she wants to tell and what she wants to just sit and smile about. she looks stupid having to use such a modern cinematic device in a film set in the 1500s. it's "the real world: tudor england!" jodhi may is a very good actress and after 'the aristocrats' and 'a turn of the screw' i was becoming a real fan of hers. but she should never have been cast as anne. actually i think she would have been a better mary. natascha mcelhone was a poor choice. she's a good actress, sure, but she has very modern features and does not appear convincing in period costume. (honestly, i spent the first half of the film trying to figure out if she was "that girl" from 'the truman show.' she was.) she's also too old to play the teen-aged mary so for some unknown reason they made mary the oldest of the sisters. it makes no sense, i know. it's like the bbc seemed to forget that these people actually lived. they're twisting the story around and making things up left and right. i feel ridiculous having to correct the bbc on historical inaccuracies, but really! apart from the two sisters the rest of the cast was actually very well chosen. steven mackintosh struck me as a brilliant choice for george, and his casting was the real reason i decided to seek out this movie. big mistake. he does a great job, sure, but he's hardly in this. how can anyone pretend they're adapting the other boleyn girl and hardly mention george boleyn? that's just absurd. philip glenister was another very good casting decision, but yet again, was hardly in the finished product. the real problem with this is the script. there's just no getting around that. it's bad. it's really, really bad. it's too melodramatic and not engaging. anne is portrayed as an air-head, mary as the ringleader, and george as the follower. mary's first husband is hardly mentioned, her relationship with the king is never explained - they simply do not tell the story phillippa gregory wrote. the whole thing comes across as a great big waste. i have no desire to see this thing a second time. i guess i'll just have to read the book again and hope that the natalie portman version due out next year will be much better.*note: as of this writing, the only way of obtaining this miniseries in the usa is on the last disc of the miniseries 'the six wives of henry viii.' that's a great miniseries but can cost $50 to $60 and that's way to much to spend if you're just looking for this piece of garbage.

i realize a period piece is expensive to make, and that this style of shooting (close framed shots to camera, moving camera, wide aperture shots, washed-out) allows such films to be made for a price. as a style, it has advantages and disadvantages like any other, it allows more period pieces to be made. like any style it has its detractors and supporters - there are probably even those that believe that this manner of shooting has an artistic basis.if only some of the money saved, could have been spent on the script for whatever style is used, a film needs good writing and good acting.the acting in this film is mostly very good. the writing less so. it is composed of a collection of bits taken from the book and much which is relevant to the plot is left out making for a disjointed collection of scenes with little or no continuity.if you have read the book, do not under any circumstances watch it. if you have not read the book, are easily pleased and have nothing better to do there is no harm in watching it, but be prepared to be disappointed.it could have been so much better.

this movie was included in the six wives of henry viii bbc miniseries dvd. i loved those six movies. they were well-acted, well-scripted, and historically accurate. i did actually read gregory's book and liked it well enough despite it's huge historical inaccuracies (i mean the whole fake homosexual angle with george boleyn in particular), but this movie didn't even mention that. that angle was one of the pivotal points of the book. above all this movie just leaves me asking "why?" why do we see, as someone else aptly put, "the real world: tudor england"? why are the camera angles so bad in general? why is the script so bad? i mean, i know it was improv, but come on! the actors at time stutter and stammer over their lines and it's obvious that they're making them up as they go along.why are the sex scenes so awkward? the way they were done in the book made them at least somewhat interesting. in the movie they're just bad, verging on being absolutely hilarious. at one point, the actress playing mary boleyn was having sex with the actor playing henry viii. he's thrusting away and she's got this look on her face that says "hm....i need to go to the store. is he done yet? maybe if he finishes i can go pick up some cheese real quick..." it's just bad.why does catherine of aragon play such a small role in this movie? her refusal to get a divorce was one of the leading causes for the scandal that rocked christiandom. she's the reason why henry viii and anne boleyn couldn't get immediately married. why is she not present here? over all, this movie is just bad.

this movie twists the facts of anne and mary's lives into something unrecognizable. to make mary boleyn, who in fact was a rather dim and foolish creature, and make her the "good" sister is just silly. it is anne who was in fact the far more interesting character, and that is why it is her life, and not mary's, that has been told so often.in response to an earlier review, i fail to see how anne's life was so "criminal"... to me it's henry who was the real criminal. whatever anne's motives for winning the king and withholding her affections in order to gain a crown and husband has to be taken into context of the time in which these real-life events took place. anne, in comparison to the majority of most of the courtiers in her time, was a relatively innocent figure. most modern historians discount or have disproven most of the myths and slanders that this movie perpetuate about her, and i have never heard of anyone who actually believes the rumour than she slept with her brother. this movie is so sensational and false that it is maddening to think that someone, without knowing anything about this period in history, could walk away believing anything this movie has presented as "fact".i won't even get into the weird filming of the movie... but i'm pretty sure that cameras weren't invented in the 16th century, so i don't understand why anne and mary are talking to one throughout the movie... it's a really bad plot devise and is jarring and annoying, to put it mildly.anne of the thousand days is not accurate either, but is infinitely more entertaining and at least comes closer to telling the story of one of the most intriguing women of history. don't even think about renting this.. it's two hours you'll never get back!

a couple of friends and myself visited the video shop a few years back and we were in one of those moods to rent some cheesy non seen flicks. my friend grabbed head of the family and we were greeted by a head sitting in a wheelchair. well that set us off laughing and we decided to have a bet to see who would be the one who had to go to the desk and pay for the movie. well you guessed it, it was me!!!!!!!! i have never been so embarrised in all my life. we got home and put it on and we rolled about the floor laughing for about 45mins because this was the funniest film in the world. i cant remember much about it but one thing i do remember was the blonde girl getting it on with some guy in the back of a shop every 5 mins. that head made me laugh and when i look at other peoples comments aboout this movie it makes me laugh even more. head of the family is so good and the head is funny and im still laughing ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

this has to be one of the all time greatest horror movies. charles band made the best movie of 96' in this little seen gem. highly realistic and , incredibly stylised- with a visual flair david fincher would envy, its not hard to see why band went on to make such classics as 'killjoy 2: deliverance from evil', 'the regina pierce affair', 'virgins of sherwood forest', and 'timegate: tales of the saddle tramps'.with a highly sophisticated story- a tiny body with a large head controls a family of weirdos who perform experiments on naked women, this movie may be a bit too much for younger viewers and is only for the most educated type of viewer, but for those who see it, band is able to convey subtle messages about the human condition through his masterpiece. the head is symbolic of the lost love and longing for one's inner self that we all must face at one point or another, and for this reason i was able to engage with this film on a deeply personal level. although many earlier critics have compared band's film to re-animator and other lesser works, this stands head and heels above the rest. it is gorier, but not pointlessly. the gore in this film is well crafted and used to enhance the storyline, rather than to just get a cheap shriek out of the audience. also, the special effects in this film are absolutely top notch, easily the best work done in a horror film since... well... ever! the work in this film makes savini's effects look like the work of a blind, limbless hobo.the only problem i have with this film is the copious amounts of full frontal nudity, which were ultimately unnecessary in achieving the composer's goal- to create a timeless epic that would forever go down in history as possibly the greatest film of all time. if it were not for this slight problem i would have given this film a perfect 10.

upon completing this infernal piece of trash, a friend and i swore a solemn vow never to again speak of how we had just trashed away the last 90 minutes of our lives. this film is completely pointless, a two dimensional hero and heroin who we can't give a hoot whether or not they survive and some of the lamest villains to ever darken the screen of horror (or any other) genre. to further prove just how absolutely pointless this film was, i would have liked to add a plot synopsis, but i can't write fiction. all and all, the only reason i can think of that anyone would ever want to view this film is if they had just murdered their entire community and is looking for some self afflicted punishment that will haunt you for all following years to come!

this movie gives a cinematic example of the word worthless. it's awful, you can forget plot or decent acting, cause it's not there. and with the dismissal of any decent story or acting or even the trait of being mildy frightening then there is usually only one plus left for a horror film. the appeal to those who like soft core porn. this film doesn't even have that. the women show a little skin, but not really anymore than say the xena show. except for the main star who is not particularly attractive and has a couple of poor, and i mean poor sex scenes. so in short if you like good movies you have no interest in this film, if you like cheese you still don't have any reason to rent this film, if you like erotica and soft core porn you really have no motive to rent this film, and most importantly if you value your time in the slightest, you cannot do better than to avoid this movie.

no gore, no blood, no gratifying death scenes...dumb dumb dumb dumb. dear god sitting through this movie made me sick. sick sick sick. very boring...extremely boring...theres not even a humorous aspect to this film! i cant find a good thing to say about it, other than the lead guy had a nice body...i guess. definitely not worth the fifty cents i paid to rent it.

this movie was not only disappointing to the horror/suspense film lover, it was disappointing to anyone who sees it. wow. i thought that this film might be funny because the guy with the huge head. however, it was filled with long and drawn out conversation that wasn't needed. there was so much sex that i hate women and men now. this film was not only boring, but there was no substance. wow. wow. on to of all this, each scene looks like it was light from a single light bulb, and i think they used the same set for two different lawyers, a restaurant, and an airport. this movie is not for the movie lover who loves bad movies because in the end, it feels likes wasted time. see the movie!-party

ahh, nuthin' like cheesy, explopitative, semi-porn, masquerading as horror...this one stars jaqueline lovell(sometimes sara st. james), the nubile starlet also seen in "femalien", "the erotic house of wax", and that family favorite "nude bowling party". she is now a fixture in surrender cinema's line-up of talentless cuties starring in pointless, soft-porn exploitation flicks. "head of the family" actually tries to be a real moovie. a con-man and a tramp try to get said-tramp's husband off-ed. they turn to a large-brained evil genius in a wheelchair, and his family of moronic misfits, who uses mind control to send out zombies to do his nefarious bidding. said-genius has a giant head, hence the clever title of the film: that's about the extent of the film's humor. but basically, it's an excuse to show off the ample talents of lovell and dianne colazzo (ernestina). laced with some of the wierdest dialogue can be herd (what the heck is "plowing oats", anycow??), and just plain stupid, this titular thriller will moost likey appeal to the breast-cownters of drive-in theater, but no one else. the moocow says avoid the devoid, unless yer looking for a rent on cheesy t&a/horror night. :=8p

i saw this film for one reason: the tagline is "upset the head and you're dead!" cracking. it's not surprising that this silly horror comedy runs out of steam before the tape is out of the box, but it wrings a few laughs from its oddball premise and cast of characters: an eagle-eyed human radar, a huge strongman, and a big-breasted sexual magnet are all mind-controlled by a huge head in a chair, who's not happy about his family being blackmailed by a murderous scumbag. this looks like being a promising mixture of ham and cheese before it becomes clear that the characters are one joke wonders and the plot is pretty ordinary if you, erm, ignore the giant head.

this movie is awful, just awful. someone bought it for me as a christmas present because they knew i liked a good horror flick. i don't think they understood the "good" part. all i can say is next year this person is getting slipper socks from me. avoid this movie-- it makes you bitter. peace.

don't get me wrong. i've got a considerable soft spot for the works of charles band, both as producer and director. but you've got to raise an eyebrow when the man who was willing to put his name to "dollman vs the demonic toys" sticks a pseudonym on anything. as a bit of bad-movie fun, "head of the family" is rather lacking, although it is better acted than you might expect. jacqueline lovell is a definite talent who deserves better than these kinds of movies. j.w. perra is also quite funny as the titular monster, though for such a superintelligent being he does get hoodwinked quite easily. y'know, i'm nitpicking because the rest of the movie is so sharp and witty of course....and having a lead character called lance bogan? nice one guys. we didn't know you americans knew that piece of slang!

one would think that with all the lavish care and expense that went into this made-for-tv movie, it would reflect something of the taste and manners of the upper class couple--wallis simpson and the prince of wales--instead of being a mawkish, unappetizing historical romance.nor is it helped by the fact that jane seymour and anthony andrews give stiff, rather uncomfortable to watch performances in which the events move much too slowly to hold attention.it's hard to understand why a star of olivia de havilland's caliber would wish to play the supporting role of aunt bessie since the role is so colorless she just about fades out of sight. at this stage in her career, olivia was appearing in so many "nobility" roles requiring a regal presence but nothing more.a trivial movie best left forgotten among all the made-for-tv movies of that era.

awful in a whole new way, anything but love probably should be seen by movie buffs--if only as a cautionary measure that proves all that can go wrong with a "vanity" production. i am guessing a vanity production, since there is no other reason on god's green earth to cast as talent-free and not particularly attractive non-singer/actress as isabel gold in the leading lady role--vied for yet by the likes of "lookers" like cameron bancroft and andrew mccarthy--except that she also helped write this bizarre little movie. her singing leaves much to be desired, and yet, unbelievable as it is, all the other characters in the film think she's terrific. there are a few moments here of actual charm or humor, but very few. otherwise this is a silly, sad fiasco that veers from paint-by-numbers to paint-by-wrong-numbers. you know how it is when people look at a piece of modern art and someone says, "my kid could do better than that!" well, this is a movie, the likes of which your--or anyone's--kid might do better.

it was poorly shot. looks like a rush job, last minute casting is obvious. writing is very weak. good for stage, not film. i feel bad for andrew mccarthy. he's a very good actor who has not been getting good roles lately. this role was not for him. maybe glad it has been picked up yet. on the festival circuit this film shall stay.

totally forgettable movie but an unbelievable soundtrack: i'd give it (soundtrack)a 9 out of 10. i have the cd and the guitar work (nils lofgren) is superb! i saw the movie years ago and had to check imdb to remember what it was about. i obsessed about getting the soundtrack and have since had to replace it. it ranges from blues/soul/ballad to a dose of gospel. all songs written, arranged, produced and performed by nils lofgren who is the "other" lead guitarist opposite steve van zandt in the e street band. this dude can play! the vocals are handled by nils (he can't sing very good-too raspy), bonnie sheridan (who is a great singer) and tom lepson.

dodgy plot, dodgy script, dodgy almost everything in fact. the most compelling performance is that of joanna pacula as lauren, but even that does not rescue this pointless and nasty film. the director's implicit invitation to viewers is not merely to suspend disbelief but to suspend judgement.presumably it is intended to be steamy and menacing, but although the film has its erotic moments they are few and far between. this sort of thing has been done better by lots of others. don't go out of your way to see it.

jud nelson is an aspiring actor who becomes involved with a married couple who enjoy playing sadistic games on other people. the husband gets his jollies by burying people alive. if that isn't bad enough, he has a miniature video camera in each coffin so he can watch his victims suffocate.

the first review i saw of this on imdb says that vince vaughn is a much better actor than anthony perkins was in this role. makes me wonder if he saw the original. it's tough to review psycho if you don't have the perspective of how revolutionary the movie was in 1960. you have a heroine who isn't very likable and is killed not far into the movie and a villain who is creepy, but makes you feel for him. add to that some graphic violence and you have a blue print for some of the slasher films of the 80s and 90s.where does this film go wrong? let's start with casting. anne heche is fine as a vivian crane, but as norman bates, vince vaughn is all wrong. for one thing, he looks far too young. secondly, he has no idea how to play the roll. his nervous laugh reminds me of ron howard trying to play a tough guy on happy days. everything he does screams i did it! the original movie, even to those who know everything about it, still makes you feel uneasy about the influence of mother on norman, and turns her into a real separate character. how about the shower scene. when i finally saw the 1960 movie on a big screen, i was surprised at its power to scare the heck out of me. bernard herrman's score becomes incredibly shrill and loud and goes further toward scaring you than danny elfman's synth interpretations during the scene. this shower scene merely serves to show us anne heche's naked body and some nice color blood. which brings us to the choice to film in color. didn't work.there is something about remaking classic films that hardly ever seems to work. some may see this as a noble experiment, but honestly, if gus van sant had nothing to add to this film, he should have left it alone

no,no,no. that is my advice to you if you are wanting to see this film. anthony perkins is the one and only norman bates,as is janet leigh in her role as marion crane. this just seems like a colorized version of psycho,with a few mildly different touches thrown in for a more modern appeal. vaughn is dull as ill norman,and viggo mortenson's sam loomis seems too much the cowboy compared to the original. please folks,do yourself some justice. don't bother with this. one can only wonder what mr. alfred hitchcock and mr. anthony perkins would be thinking right now....... * out of ****

honestly, how hard can it be to make a good remake? obviously pretty hard! i was soooo excited to see this because i loved the original, and my friends go and see it and tell me it really sucks. well, i finally see it and i was sooo disapointed. ok, the shower scene was more realistic...that's why i gave it a 3. otherwise, it did suck. vince vaughn does a terrible job playing norman, he's just too dense or something. i don't know, it was just terrible. don't see it!

the original "psycho" (1960) is widely considered as alfred hitchcock's best work and certainly, in my opinion, is one of the best movies of all time. the decision to film a shot by shot remake is therefore, a little puzzling.the cast in the original was flawless, so the cast of this remake had a lot to live up to. vince vaughn as norman bates was not a good choice for the lead. he is too much of a pretty boy hunk and is not very convincing as bates. i can imagine actors such as mark wahlberg or john turturro doing a much better job in the role. anne heche as marion crane does a creditable job, but one keeps mentally comparing her to janet leigh. julianne moore is a much better actress than she shows here and viggio mortenson merely walks through his role. the best of this new cast is william h. macy as the private detective.although director gus van sant does an acceptable job, he can't build the suspense the way hitchcock did. and why did he change the scene in the basement of the house? in the original, the atmosphere is dark and damp and closed in, whereas in this version, it takes place in a brightly lit laboratory like setting. and i think the black & white photography of the original has a definite advantage over the color version.maybe another flaw could be the fact that most moviegoers have seen the original and know what is going to happen and when.all i can say is if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

okay, so gus van sant wanted to remake psycho in color so that he could bring it into modern audiences, who would probably go into cardiac arrest if they were ever forced to see a movie in black & white, while they conveniently forget that both "clerks" and "schindler's list" were filmed in black & white and are great movies.unfortunately, the same narrow-minded people who wouldn't want to see a great movie just because it's in black & white are the same people who wouldn't like "psycho" anyway, because it doesn't have a murder or sex scene every two minutes. and the murders are not the grisly blood/guts/gore/bone-snapping that people are used to from having seen "halloween," "friday the 13th" and "nightmare on elm street." this is why remaking "psycho" almost exactly as it was originally was destined to not work, because it's really only of interest to people who are fans of the original. everyone else is just watching it to tide them over until the next "scream" sequel comes out, and for that reason, they will be disappointed. "psycho" relies on suspense and mystery, not blood and guts. (and just so nobody thinks that i must be a senior citizen if i like older movies, let me set the record straight by saying that i am 21.)so if doing the movie in color was all that van sant wanted to change, why not just colorize the movie and rerelease it? i mean, what's the point of remaking a movie if you're not going to change *anything*? the least he could have done was to put his own director's spin on it, rather than just copying hitchcock's - or even better, hired a new writer to adapt a new script from the original "psycho" book. but it seems that van sant couldn't decide whether he wanted to remake "psycho" *exactly* or not. this should have been an all or nothing project - either remake the movie exactly or do it differently - but as it stands, this movie is about 95% the same, but with a few touches thrown in that don't seem to have any purpose. such as having norman masturbate while he spies on marion undressing. it doesn't serve the plot at all, and the only reason he put it in was because he *could*. he wanted to say, "hitch couldn't show people masturbating in 1960 so i'm going to do it." whoopee, big deal, like i'm so shocked at seeing someone masturbate. and what on earth was the point of showing single frame shots of clouds and farm animals spliced into the murder scenes? and then he leaves *out* an important scene, where lila and sam meet the sheriff outside the church.plus, by using the almost exact same script, the entire movie seems a bit of an anachronism. the opening credits say that the year is 1998. then what's with marion's 60-ish looking dress or the parasol she carries with her? why do marion and sam have to have their trysts in a hotel room, when these days nobody would be shocked by what they are doing? why are there no air conditioners in marion's office? why does the bates motel have no tv's in the rooms, and apparently no automatic locks on the doors? why does the sheriff have to ask the operator to connect him to the bates motel? this was why using the exact same script was a mistake - just changing a few words here and there was not enough to modernize it. it needed a whole reworking.while vince vaughn turned in a good performance as norman, he just didn't seem right for the part. part of what made the original "psycho" so creepy was that norman had that innocent, boy-next-door quality, so nobody could believe that he was capable of such horrible crimes. with vince vaughn playing the part, is anyone really surprised that norman was a psychopathic killer?that said, i can understand that gus van sant was obviously a fan of the original "psycho" movie, and wanted this to be a tribute. this isn't a bad movie, but the problem is that this may be some people's only exposure to "psycho." i really think you should see this movie only if you've seen the original. since i am a fan of anything to do with "psycho," i bought a used copy of the remake, which i may watch occasionally. the original movie was a filet mignon, whereas the remake is a hamburger. but even filet mignon would get boring if you had it everyday, so it's nice to have a hamburger once in a while, for a change.

norm(an)ally i don't mind remakes. there are some pretty good ones out there, but this one is a stinker! considering it was practically scene for scene, it had a good story and great actors. van sant copied al's direction virtually flawlessly, and it added color (i'm not one of those who think it has to be b&w to be classic). it should have been at least a mediocre movie... but it was pee-pee caa-caa! i don't understand how it could have been screwed up so badly. if you must, watch it as a curiosity, but i would suggest that you not bother.

the 1998 version of "psycho" needed to be set back in the 60's, rather than present day. the headliners would have done a good job with the setting. there were two scenes that just stuck out like a sore thumb. the first one was at the beginning of the movie when marian crane (anne heche) was sitting at her desk. her boss took his client into his office because "it was air conditioning." i imagine that the majority of arizona businesses have air conditioning. the other was the meeting of lila crane (julianne moore) & sam loomis (viggo mortensen). lila sporting the walkman seemed like an exaggeration to update the movie. the movie did spook a number of the viewers in the theater.

this is one of the dumbest ideas for a movie. remake a classic film shot-by-shot. i hope nobody tries this technique again. in 1998, "good will hunting" director gus van sant tried it by remaking hitchcock's 1960 classic "psycho" and failed miserably. what on earth was van sant thinking of? this remake doesn't even come close to topping the original. the few changes that were made here were no help. if you want to see "psycho", the choice is obvious. see the original.* (out of four)

a remake of a successful movie can be a tricky business at best; to remake a true classic, especially one that is veritably the definitive film of a director like alfred hitchcock, is something else again. and after watching this version of `psycho,' directed by gus van sant, two things come to mind immediately: what's the point, and what on earth were they thinking? especially in light of the fact that van sant used the same screenplay (by joseph stefano, taken from the novel by robert bloch) that hitchcock used. the final result here underscores some of the finer points of the art of filmmaking: first, that a `remake' should be just that; a retooling of the original, rather than a `copy' using new players; and second, that shooting in color, using more blood and being a bit more graphic does little more than detract from the impact of the film. although this was a noble effort by van sant, ironically in the end it suffers from the same flaw with which norma bates was afflicted: the `mind' of the film was divided; half was hitchcock, half van sant. and the twain, though met, shall never be bound. van sant, even working from the original script, would have been better off making his own film-- all the way through-- rather than attempting to duplicate exactly what hitchcock did with certain scenes. the opening shot of the movie, for instance, and especially the `shower' scene, arguably one of the most famous scenes in the history of the cinema. copying hitchcock, from the shots looking directly into the shower head to the one of the drain, and using the same `skree! skree! skree!' sound effects-- even as homage to hitchcock-- again, only distracted from the story. and, if you factor in the performance of william h. macy (as private eye arbogast), you have yet another split in the psyche of the film. macy is a terrific actor-- one of the best character actors in the business-- and his performance here is excellent; but as good as it is, the attitude and delivery are pure david mamet (with whom he has worked many times), and seemingly out of context with what van sant is doing. so the film winds up with a triple personality disorder: hitchcock, van sant and mamet. i felt like i was watching `house of good will psycho games.' 	as far as performances go, macy's was as solid as they come, and anne heche (marion crane) did a good job of creating an original character, escaping the trap of attempting an imitation of janet leigh. the weak links were viggo mortensen (sam), who made marion's boyfriend so smarmy and unappealing it made you wonder why she had anything to do with him in the first place; and vince vaughn, who--to put it as delicately as possible-- was simply awful as norman bates. his whole performance was that of an actor playing a role (and not very convincingly at that); affecting effeminate mannerisms and punctuating his speech with `spontaneous' bursts of maniacal laughter made his norman more of a caricature than a character, altogether unbelievable and pretentious. it gave the movie the feel of a reenactment of a `true incident' you would see on a television show; it would have been entirely in keeping with the sensibility of the film to cut away from norman sitting alone in his parlor to a shot of a sober-faced peter graves, intoning, `such was the mind-set of norman bates on that fateful, rainy night when marion crane stepped out of her car and into his life--' the supporting cast includes julianne moore (lila), robert forster (dr. simon), philip baker hall (sheriff al chambers), anne haney (mrs. chambers), chad everett (tom cassidy), rance howard (mr. lowery), rita wilson (caroline), james remar (patrolman) and james legros (charlie the car dealer). if nothing else, van sant's `psycho' is a curiosity that goes to show that having a good director, a predominantly excellent cast and a script that is a proven commodity does not necessarily insure a success. granted, todays era of psycho-babble, `american psycho' and hannibal lecter have effectively taken the edge off of a character like norman bates somewhat; but there is still a singular intimacy in this particular story of the relationship between norman, his mother and his victims that will forever remain inherently disturbing and terrifying; but van sant is unable to convey that sense of dread, that throat-clenching fear, with this film. if ever there was a movie made that should have been earmarked straight-to-video, this is it. better still, had it never been born. i rate this one 2/10

*spoilers included*alfred hitchcock's brilliant and innovative adaptation of robert bloch's novel was an amazing film, unlike anything previous. every shot, every camera angle, every nuance was perfect. he didn't just break the rules, he made up a whole set of new ones.here's the spoiler: there is absolutely nothing new, different, or original about this movie. gus van sant doesn't just pay a homage to hitch, he rips off every idea, and does so in a less original, more conventional manner. i didn't have anything against gus van sant before i saw this movie. i liked drugstore cowboy and i thought my own private idaho was a very interesting film. the question burning in my mind when it comes to the remake of psycho is, "why did you do it, gus?"in my mind, there are only two reasons to do a remake: 1) the original was a good story, but the movie sucked. 2) the original was a good movie, but someone has thought of a fresh, new approach to the material. neither one of these factors is at all present in the gus van sant version of psycho. apart from the fact that it is in color, and there is one scene in which there is a montage of disturbing imagery relating to the title character's possible inner dialogue (which i found unnecessary), there is nothing new here.furthermore, i found the casting left something to be desired. anne heche was okay as marion, but she lacked a certain vulnerability that janet leigh portrayed in the original. i didn't feel as sympathetic towards her character, because the choices she faced seemed far less constrained as a woman in today's society, as opposed to the choices she would have faced as a single woman living in the early 1960's. vince vaughn got a few laughs with his rendering of an incredibly naive norman bates, but i feel that anthony perkins' timing and nervous, haunted look was much more effectively creepy. the only performance that i enjoyed better than the original was the character of lila crane, played by jullianne moore. she was excellent as usual, and brought a new strength and intelligence to the character.to be fair, there is some beautiful camera work, especially during the famous "bathroom scene" in which van sant takes advantage of his use of color to show the murder in vibrant shades of crimson. and yet, during the whole film i had this irritating sense of deju vu. haven't i seen this somewhere before? oh wait, i have seen this somewhere before! nearly every scene seems to be copied shot for shot from the original. one almost gets the feeling the director made this film as a school project. "see, i can make a hitchcock film, too!"if you haven't already, go see the original. it's held up over the years, and beats this bit of mediocrity, hands down. you won't be disappointed.

okay they tell you it's real. they don't list any screenwriters or directors, but one viewing of this movie will prove to anyone - it's not real in the way you were hoping for. the speaking rarely sounds like real natural talk...but also down not sound to be scripted. (possibly loosely scripted). to me it sounded much more like they were always trying to ad-lib. (which they almost always did poorly). therefore, they knew they were making a 'movie', not just collecting real natural footage. so i'm sure these people knew what was going on, knew they had certain spots to look for things that were set up...and they were just told to ad-lib around it all.*************'major spoilers'**************** *****************************************okay, it's so lame. every item, spot or thing that could be strange or use d as a scare, is magically stumbled upon by these people. let me list off the ridiculously obviously faked things that happened that i remember:1) less than 2 minutes of entering the house, they turn a light switch on - the light sparks and a chandelier almost falls on a guy.2) they happen to find an old medical bag with a bloody butcher knife* in it, while exploring the cellar.3) they hear a noise in an armoire, so they open the door slowly - bam - a cat happens to be in there and jumps straight at the camera while shrieking.4) then they happen to notice there is a hole in the wall, so let's stick our hand in...wow, they pulled out a doll of a baby wrapped in mummy tape.5) let's go to the attic, uh-oh it feels 'heavy' up here....boom - a chair flies across the room.6) time to eat. oh no ! the girl that was scared of bugs had a roach in her sandwich ! lol !....ridiculous.7) let's get out the ouija board...oops one of the legs on the planchette fell off the side of the board. that couldn't be because the people were pushing it could it ? (they find out a ghost there is named charles)8) wait ! what was that noise in the chimney...clink - oh my shackles fell out "i think she* kept people up here".9) now wimpy girl is going to brave looking up the chimney shaft...oh, what's this she sees something...and is asking people who aren't looking up the chimney what it is. swish - it falls off straight at her. (perfect camera shot) she moves just in time. it was more chain.10) now we have to separate and each 'cleanse' our designated rooms - wouldn't it be something if things started happening one by one to these people now...okay:chick #1: wow, suddenly her room is shaking...but no one elses does.dude #1: actually says to himself "charles, is that you charles...it can't be you because you're just a figment of my imagination aren't you charles". well guess what, he gets knocked over and dragged across the floor. another lucky camera shot.chick #2: hears things..try to communicate ...and is standing there getting abrasions or something.dude #2: he was in the attic, reached his arm through a hole in the floor and got a splinter....i don't remember what else.11) dude #2 runs, gets chick #2...they hear chick and dude #1 screaming...they find them chained to a wall and strapped to a table.(*) they leave. cut to black. final text tell us they escaped safely, were treated for minor cuts. they have since had nightmares and insomnia, we also find out the next day a 911 call was made by they name a someone named "charles".*************'major spoilers'**************** ******************over********************okay, when i first heard this movie was being made, i couldn't wait. i thought it was going to be real. real, real. - and more professional, with more professional type people. i love the idea of this type of thing, i'd love to see real haunting footage. before this movie was released i saw couple reviews of it by people online. they both claimed how fake it was and how stupid the people were.. time passed i forgot about the film....then i realized it was never released at theaters. so i found out it went straight to video, rented it....found that every brutal review was completely true. it's too bad, i really wanted this to be good.random thought: the house didn't seem to have tvs, radios..kitchen appliances that i recall...which would make me think no one has lived there for a long time. especially the house is truly known for being haunted...im pretty sure no one lives there. but it looks so clean and tidy...and what was a cat doing there ? the property does not have near by neighbors....all-in-all, you'll only want to rent this if you and your friends wanna sit there and make fun of it...or if you heard about it a long time ago and it intrigued you. (you will will be disappointed if you are expecting a good film...or real film)random thought: i believe the producer says "the 'footage' you see is real". well technically it is real footage isn't it ? real footage of fake hauntings ? maybe that was his loop hole.i give this this movie one star - strictly on the fact that they told the story of madame lalaurie. a real new orleans story.the best performance was by the guy who teaches the participants about the ghost hunting equipment in the beginning. he was obviously actually real...or a good actor.

i was surprised that the makers of this movie actually came out said that this movie was a true story. the majority of the scenes looked fake to me. for instance when the one girl was eating her sandwich and there was a roach in it. while she was eating the sandwich the camera on the opposite side of it showed that there was a roach on it. it's funny how the camera just happened to be filming on the sandwich when the girl was eating it. another scene is when the gang went to open a clothes closet and a cat flew out of the closet or should i say it was thrown out to give it effect. this movie was not realistic at all. it's highly doubtful that the events that happened were true that evening when the "st. francisville experiment" took place. i believe that the house may be haunted, but not on the night this movie was filmed! the ending was amusing when tim and and other girl were chained down in the some sort of basement. paul and madison found them and rescued them! i would rather watch the blair witch project again then have to sit through the st. francisville experiment movie again. as i said, if the makers of the movie did not state that this was a true story with true events i may have like it more. your better off getting more entertainment from the blair witch project (even though this is not a true story either)!!!

the characters are annoying, immature, and flaky....madison being the most annoying of all. ooh...a cold spot! such a dire threat! any ghost in that house would have fled in self-defense! to make a long story short, this movie is boring. seeing a chair flying across a room may be creepy, but that's about as intriguing as it gets. i watched it once and when one of my kids wanted to watch it again, i was tempted to take a baseball bat to the tv set rather than watch this rubbish again. if you want a good horror movie or even a passable comedy, this isn't it! the only good part of the whole thing was "the roach scene" and, by the end of the movie, you ended up feeling sorry for the roach!

one would think that anyone embarking upon a followup to the groundbreaking naked civil servant of 30-plus years ago would at the very least try to honor the original with some kind of inspired vision, but no. here we have a sort of biopic of one of the most stylish people of the late 20th century that itself boasts no style whatsoever. true, the filmmakers have assembled some outstanding actors - and handed them a chipped mug of drab gruel to work with. everything in the infrastructure of this film is wrong, starting with the script, which is another one of those tv-movie condensations of great lives wherein every other line is a "famous quote" by the subject and every other scene is an in-your-face introduction to the next pivotal character in the subject's life. we get swoozie kurtz as a pr maven who promotes crisp as a stateside entertainer; denis o'hare as the editor of a gay periodical who hires crisp as film reviewer, becomes somewhat alienated from him when he appears indifferent to the passions of 80's aids activists, and then returns to the fold as a compassionate friend of the dying octogenarian; jonathan tucker (in a fine performance) as a shy, insecure painter of gay-themed canvases who is befriended by crisp; and finally cynthia nixon as performance artist and woman-about-bohemia penny arcade who, intrigued by crisp's persona, offers him a spot in her traveling cabaret act. nixon is a persuasive and gifted performer but is given no chance by the script to embody the down-to-earth and streetwise arcade. crisp spent the last 20 years of his life in a one-room flat in an old tenement building in manhattan's east village. he famously said that he never cleaned because "after a few years the dust doesn't get any worse," or something like that. but looking at the depiction of that flat in this film you'd never get the flavor of that dustiness. he frequented a local coffee shop on a busy avenue and would be seen pretty much each day of the week sipping tea and watching the world go by. in this film we get a diner that looks like something on 12th avenue by the hudson river. most of the "streets of new york" scenes have a sterile, unreal look with no sense of the period. the soul of this film is the great john hurt in the title role. after nearly 35 years he can still grasp the essence of this peculiar post-edwardian englishman and put it across to third millennarians. his every line, every gesture is exquisite. in the later scenes he even modulates his vocal projection to suit that of a person whose life is winding down toward death. crisp wrote shortly before he left this realm that when one grows very, very old one's skin takes on the character of a smelly overcoat that cannot be removed and one longs for death. one senses that feeling in hurt's performance. so, for him and him alone this film is worth a look.

how in the world does a thing like this get into my dvd player at home? how does it even get to be packaged and distributed? are there absolutely zero screenings a movie (and i use that term loosely) have to go through before it's put on a video store's shelf anymore? i'm all for diy film making but come on! that doesn't entitle me to get a group of my friends and relatives together, a crappy camcorder, an awful story and put it all together to create a heaping pile of crap and call it a movie. and i wish people would quit using the words "indie" and "campy" to describe these types of movies. they're not either. in no other profession would something like this be considered acceptable. if someone tried to sell you car that was as bad as this movie, you'd take it back and say it was a lemon. if it was a surgical procedure, you'd be suing the doctor for malpractice. i wish i could get my time and money back after watching this. shame on the video stores who stock movies like these. they're a rip-off to the public. you want "campy"? go get any of the friday the 13th movies (even the later ones) or dead-alive. at least those don't make you want to kill yourself. it's because of movies like this that make people automatically equate independent with garbage.

mary, mary, bloody mary is an ok time killer. it has a uniformly attractive cast, the action is rarely dull. there are a lot of killings. and the production values are not bad. but in the end, it plays like a standard tv episode from the 1970s with some nudity thrown in. the film is the end product of an "author" trying to make a purely commercial film. there's very little depth here and the film spends too much time with chases and action scenes. except for the scene on the beach with the old man, mmbm is almost devoid of any scares or suspense or dread. the director has very little understanding of the horror genre.it's watchable even though it doesn't leave a lasting impression.

some movies you watch and you say, "well, that made no sense." and you don't really mean it. you're just saying things were overly complicated or slightly nonsensical."bread and circus" makes no sense at all. and i mean it. and that's not because it's surreal. from the start, it's pretty clear it's a feeble excuse to do splatter special effects. there's no script. there's no plot. there's no story of any kind. one event does not lead to the next -- that's how fundamental the bad writing is here.so what? i mean, there are tons of movies out there that fall into that category. they want to show you gore, they give you gore. why even talk about it?because, in this case, "bread and circus" gave me hope. okay, there are some surreal elements. vaginas, in the ground -- people crawling out of them. the earth, in space, two legs on either side. these sorts of images are wonderful, fun, odd, crazy. but the movie doesn't do anything with them.stuff happens, the movie ends, and it's all very unsatisfying. i suspect the script was made up on the fly. too bad. if there had been a story of any kind at all, it would have made for a much more entertaining film.the film is very much like the beautiful car you would love to own. then you lift up the hood and there's no engine. just a small man peddling a bicycle.grr!

a chicago couple, dillon and dougherty, are falsely accused of killing their daughter. people begin to wonder if they did it. the police investigate and find suspicious evidence. the couple are maligned by the public and accused in the press. the cops speculate that they are satanists and have ritually murdered their own daughter. they are charged and brought to trial. they are represented by publicity-seeking lawyers who give them bad advice and bill them for $100,000. the evidence presented against them is twisted or hidden by the police. fabricated intimations of sexual abuse are presented. their other child is taken away from them and put in a foster home. dougherty is pregnant and gives birth to find her baby removed. verdict, she didn't do it but he did. he goes to the slams with a sentence of 45 years.in the last third of the movie, with dillon in jail and dougherty wondering what to do next, we see people who have been antagonistic now slowly coming to the couple's defense. witnesses admit to having lied. other facts are brought to light that, finally, result in dillon's release. the killer is never found, though the movie gives us a thorough whacko as a plausible perp.this is a weeper from beginning to end. nothing seems to go right for the couple. oh, there are a few happy moment, maybe a party where everyone is glad to be together and tearing up with joy, or some point of evidence in their favor is discovered and people hug one another. but it's never long before someone rushes through the door with more bad news and all the faces are frozen in tragic disbelief. (usually a fade to block follows.) there isn't necessarily anything wrong with moving tragedies, although i can't imagine what pleasure we get out of seeing people suffer. there's plenty of tragedy in shakespeare too. i suppose whatever we find interesting about tragic stories lies in the way they're told. "oh, but i am fortune's fool!" romeo cries after killing juliet's brother. here we have dougherty running in her robe through a hospital corridor, screaming, "where's my baby???" there isn't any ambiguity or irony in the story -- as i'm sure there must have been in the real life events on which it's based. people are either good or bad here. or else they're bad, then they turn good.the film isn't aimed at exploring human quirkiness, or the way things work out. it's aimed at wrenching tears from the audience. the actors provide first-rate role models. i can't remember the last movie in which i saw so many tears. there are rivulets of tears. showers of them. cascades of them. a veritable niagara of them. a lake lacrymose of them.well, i'll give one example of the efficiency with which the movie is crafted. dillon and dougherty hire a chicago cop who works on the side as a private investigator (ed asner). asner is sympathetic to them but he doesn't really accomplish much. he seems to be in the movie not because of his importance to the case but because he can provide the victimized couple with a kind of philosophy -- "learn to live with it," which is okay -- and because he suffers from colorectal cancer, so we can watch him take his medicine, double over with pain, and finally pass away.what's frustrating about the movie is that in focusing so intensely on the suffering of the couple, it sidesteps one of the more important issues that it raises -- the function of gossip in regulating private lives.gossip is a strange thing really. if we call it "gossip" it's bad, but if we call it "public opinion" it sounds acceptable, at the very least. of course we all have convictions about issues that may or may not be justified. (as i write, michael jackson is once again being brought to court accused of molesting a young boy, and i wonder how many of us thrilled at the news and immediately assumed he was a pedophile.) but gossip isn't all bad either. it's like water. when it's properly controlled it's a community asset. we need gossip to keep each other in line. it helps us to maintain public order. but, like water in a flood or a tsunami, it is ruinous to a village when it rages out of control.this is a movie that's okay if you're not looking for too much in the way of insight into human nature. it's done so cleverly that, given its goal, it's hard to argue with it.

they prove that the cops, when they can't find the real perpetrators, always blame the parents and accuse them of sexual abuse of their kids. these movies always depict the press as a bunch of animals and have the parents coming out of court to feed the press' hunger to humiliate the grief-stricken. hasn't anybody ever heard of a courthouse back door in these movies? here, you have a psychic who tells them exactly what happened and where the body can be found, but the police are not told and nobody heeds his findings.the police are portrayed as blockheads who don't know what they are doing and there's always an outside detective, like ed asner, who comes in late on the case, believes in the parents and solves the mystery.also, after the parents are cleared, they don't spit in the faces of the dumb cops who put them in jail, took their kid away and accused them of killing their own child.it looked as if i've see this film many times before.

the opening scene really got me into watching the movie. however, not more than 5 minutes later, i was already gouging my eyes out. not only could i not understand a word that was said, the acting could have been better by a group of mentally handicapped. the one highlight of this movie was that there was a punk white midget. however, i didn't quite get the connection on how a white midget was the child of two african americans. but i guess anything is possible. also, why the hell was robin in the movie? i'm not sure that it added anything artistically. overall, i would strongly recommend you jump off a cliff before you rent this movie.

"carlito's angels" is a spoof of "charlie's angels" that is not afraid to spoof even itself at times, however that does not mean that the film is above criticism by the viewers as well - it is amateurish and juvenile (i think "fast-motion" stopped being funny around 1914). the assaulting rap music often drowns out the dialogue, and the film feels longer than it is, even though it runs barely over an hour! the girls themselves are hot & adorable, with wonderful lean bodies, and even though they never get naked, their outfits leave little to the imagination. by checking out their imdb pages, i found out that one of them (alessandra ramos) is actually going through with a film career; i wish her luck, because although this film is bad, she (as well as the other girls) gave it whatever energy it has and i wouldn't mind at all seeing her again on the screen. (*)

i thought that this movie might be a good spoof, or at least a good independent comedy like friday. instead it was more like something someone in high school would make with their parents' camcorder. it wasn't just the low budget that makes this film bad (many great films have been made on a low budget), it is simply a bad movie and it wasn't even bad enough to be good camp. case in point: for the first ten minutes of the movie nothing happens except the 3 main characters sit in their room smoking dope, put on their makeup, and then answer a phone call. you keep waiting for something to get story moving, but it never comes. the sound was so bad i had to turn the tv up all the way just to almost make out what they were saying (which wasn't interesting anyways). if i pay to rent a movie i will usually suffer through it even when it's bad, but it was all i could do to sit through 20 minutes. it looks like the person before me felt the same way because they didn't rewind the tape and left off about the same place i did. the only reason i gave this a score of 1 is because the rating system doesn't have negative numbers.

this movie really shows its age. the print i saw was terrible due to age, but it is possible that there are better prints out there. however, this was not the major problem with the movie. the problem was that although the film was made in 1933, it was essentially a silent film with only the barest of dialog scattered (only a few sentences) in the film in the most amateur fashion. sometimes the characters' backs were turned or they were talking with their hands over their faces--all in a pathetic attempt to obscure their lips and "cleaverly" (?) hide the fact that the film was dubbed. well, its true that this czech film would need to be dubbed into many languages but to do it this way was really stupid and obvious. it just looked cheap.overall, the film looked low budget and silly. it's really a shame though, because there was a grain of a good story--a young woman who marries an older man who is either gay and/or has no interest in women. but in the 21st century, few people would really be willing to sit through this archaic mess. even with a few glimpses of the naked (and somewhat chunky) hedy lamarr, it isn't worth all the fuss that accompanied the film when it debuted. even by 1933 standards, this film was a poorly made dud. about the only interesting thing about the film is to see how different lamarr looked in 1933 compared with the glamorous image hollywood created when she came to america--she looks like 2 completely different people.it's such an incomplete looking and technically inferior film, i don't see how it has gotten such rave reviews. for technical problems alone, the movie can't rate a 10 or anything near it.

it's unlikely that anyone except those who adore silent films will appreciate any of the lyrical camera-work and busy (but scratchy) background score that accompanies this 1933 release. although sound came into general use in 1928, there are no more than fifty words spoken to tell the story of a woman, unhappily married, who deserts her husband for a younger man after a romantic interlude in the woods.the most vividly photographed scene has the jealous husband giving a lift to the young man for a ride into town, proceeding to drive normally until he realizes the man is his wife's lover. in a frenzy of jealousy, he drives at top speed toward a railroad crossing but changes his mind at the last moment, losing his nerve. it's probably the most tension-filled scene in the otherwise decidedly slow-moving and obviously contrived story.hedy lamarr is given the sort of close-up treatment lavished on marlene dietrich by her discoverer, but her beauty had not yet been refined by the cosmeticians as they were when she was transported to hollywood. her performance consists mostly of looking sad and morose while mourning the loss of her marriage with only brief glimpses of a smile when she finds her true love (aribert mog), the handsome young stud who retrieves her clothes after a nude swim.the swimming scene is very brief, discreetly photographed, and not worth all the heat it apparently generated. the love-making scene, later on, is also artfully photographed with the sort of lyrical photography evident throughout most of the film--artfully so. more is left to the imagination with the use of symbolism--and this is the sort of thing that has others proclaiming the film is some kind of lyrical masterpiece.not so. it's disappointing, primitively crude in its sound portions (including the laborious symphonic music in the background) and certainly miss lamarr is fortunate that louis b. mayer saw the film and on the basis of it, gave her a career in hollywood. he must have seen something in her work that i didn't.it's apparent that this was conceived as a silent film with the camera doing all the work. the jarring "workers" scene at the conclusion goes on for too long and is a jarring intrusion where none is needed. it fails to end the film on the proper note.

i saw this film when it first came out and hated it. i just saw it again 27 years later. i actually liked some of it... although robin williams was totally wrong for the role... what i remember most about hating the film is that it was almost the complete opposite of what i had understood when i read the book. since i haven't re-read it, i can only give you my impressions from the past - but i am sure of one thing - the film is a paean to family life, whereas in the book, almost all traditional institutions - including, and perhaps especially, marriage - are shown to be strait-jackets that we would be well rid of. the only positive in the book is the wondrous nature of children...something that only the very beginning and ending of the film really captures (with that incredibly gorgeous baby floating in the air. too bad williams doesn't have a tenth of his charm!) my low mark is therefore from the fact that the film misrepresents the book. as a film on its own it fares better - but only for a few key performances. mary beth hurt is wonderful - i think anyone watching it would fall in love with her. and john lithgow as an ex football player who has had a sex-change operation is fantastic... he never once camped it up or made the character anything but commendable - and as such his performance had an incredibly integrity. i watched him closely during all of his scenes, and never once was he anything except womanly. nothing in his performance ever came near the performance of a drag queen... and that made all the difference. in fact, of all the people in the film, his is the only one which is irreproachable. it is worth seeing this film only for his performance.

i went to see this movie at the theater and paid money thinking it would be at least mildly entertaining. the only thing i enjoyed about it was when robin williams crashes into the car at the bottom of the hill, and the end, when he seems to get killed. glenn close was obnoxious, and she obviously did not seem old enough to be garp's mother. a mother like garp's would have had her kids taken away by the department of children and families. robin williams and his glazed donut look of benign goodness is just too sweet and smarmy for me. he has two roles he can play: funny person or sad, tragic, good-hearted victim. see the fisher king, good morning vietnam, and all of his so-called "dramatic" roles. it is always the same performance. put them all together into one long mini-series. glenn close is always a cold fish. remember fatal attraction? would you have an affair with her even on your worst day and if you were single? did you feel any sparks between her and michael douglas?? have you ever seen glenn close warm up any screen?? john lithgow had the only interesting role. this was back in the day when he used to play serial killers and bad guys, so seeing him as a transsexual was at least funny. garp is made for all those people who love to see movies about sick, abnormal, dysfunctional people and then claim it is beautiful and profound.

tediously long dreary cinematic waffle. i couldn't believe how bad this film was. i watched it merely because of the numerous people who gushed about it on this site. was i watching the same film? the entire episode is one-dimensional. nothing that happened in garps' past affected his (or anyone else's) future and no-one was affected by their past. i think it was socrates who said about plays that if a scene can be removed from a play without having any effect, then it shouldn't be there. obviously, the director didn't know this rule and, so, stuffed his 'work' with one dire scene after another. even the plane crashing into the house was unexpected, it wasn't a surprise, but it was unexpected!it is worth mentioning that at the time of writing this (1st dec 2002), even though many people say it is one of their favourite films, no one has bothered to add a memorable quote. the reason being that there simply aren't any.don't waste your time watching this, watch a plank warp instead.

who the heck is responsible for this terrible mangling of one of my favorite books? this is just terrible. terrible acting, terrible script. the story isn't even close to its old self - and what were they thinking? robin williams, for gosh's sake! this really defies description. don't see this. seriously, don't. not even for laughs. especially not if you're a fan of the book. this might just be the worst movie adaptation ever - everything is disjointed and scrambled - the characters which are important in order to understand the sequence of events are seriously marginalized, and every potentially interesting location from the book has been changed (example: vienna - new york) into something profoundly uninteresting.for those who haven't read the book - it's basically a fictional biography about a writer growing up, exploring his writing and so on. his mother writes an autobiography which is hailed (despite her protests) as a sort of feminist manifesto. the book is well-written, engaging, and long. its prose is simply beautiful.this movie, on the other hand, is about robin williams once again telling us to seize the day.

empty shortening of john irving's novel strives for profundity courageously but ends up being absurd. it's a quirky, goofy and bittersweet string of sketches, attempting to explain a man's growth from birth to adulthood and how he deals with the vices of lust and fanaticism that surround him. garp is born to a formidable unmarried mother, jenny fields, played by glenn close.(the various stages of garp's childhood are played by three young actors before robin williams takes over as garp reaches adulthood.) the story follows him through childhood at a boys' prep school, where jenny is the school nurse, through his high school passions-wrestling,writing,and sex-to marriage with his high school sweetheart, children, marital problems and a writing career. jenny meanwhile has become a famous feminist , espousing an unorthodox cause. the plot details an abundance of comic and tragicomic episodes and outlandish adventures. williams gives a cherub-faced performance. this script was not fitting for his wildness and anarchy and thus his talent was wasted. he's like an injured bird sputtering out of control. john lithgow's role as a father like transsexual, imparting wisdom, also doesn't make sense. this movie was able to attract some reasonable attention in 1982, due to the popularity of robin williams and his new entry into movies. williams had recently shed his mork and mindy pursuits and focused more on stand-up comedy and movies. audiences were confused by this film, especially by its arbitrary and inexplicable ending.

i was thrilled by the fresh (pun intended) synopsis of this film and looking forward to watch it. the first few shots introduce some of the characters as well as the main location where the stories take place; the gardening allotments. the movie looks fantastic. colorful yet simple. magical yet genuine. unfortunately, it only takes a few minutes to figure out where the movie will go. we quickly figure out this will be a manipulative, sappy tale illustrating a bunch of jaded people set in their ways confronted by "nice victimized" refugees and that it will have a happy ending where the jaded people realize the error of their ways and accept these people. the characters, particularly the prejudiced ones, are very "comic-booky" in nature. the story focuses mainly on two refugee families. one of them is headed by a single mom played atrociously by diveen henry. i am saddened to say that any emotion that might have been felt toward her struggles were defused by what was memorably bad acting.the other story is much more interesting and focuses on a father and his two children. all are scarred by their journey to this country by way of containers, where the wife and mother died but it is the husband who suffers the most. benedict wong gives a mind-blowing performance here. at first, his emotions are very subdued but as the story develops, he subtly makes us aware of the inner-struggles of his character. unfortunately, the rest of the movie is just extremely boring. there were so many possibilities with this movie. there are several characters to keep track of, many of which might have potential but none of it is realized. even worse, despite this movie being very much not hollywoodian, some of the main plot threads are solved cheaply in a hollywood b-grade way. example:character a likes character b character b rejects his advances no problem! let's have character c declare her love for character a so we can all have a happy ending. yawn. i liked very much the plot thread of the asian family. that was well done. unfortunately, the whole allotment business, the communal aspect of it, the dynamic involving a large cast are all under exploited.what you're left with is a movie that has very little worth.

i only gave this film a 4 because i saw it in 3-d. if you don't see it in 3-d, i give it a 2. this movie is so bad it's not funny. anyone can make a film like this for a weeks pay. bad acting,effects and story!!! but it was cool to watch in 3d. why can't they make good movies in the 3-d format???

83 minutes? nope, this thing is 72 minutes, tops.if you cannot guess the killer in this movie, you had better throw your tv out the window, because you ain't learned nothing in 20+ years of cinematic slasher history.and how come the plain star who never gets naked is always the one you want to get naked?

yeah i bought camp blood and it wasted about 86 minutes of my life and 5 pounds of my money on this crap, i mean i didn't expect an amazing movie, judging by the front cover i wasn't really expecting anything great but at least not boobies in the first 3 seconds (i'm not complaining about the boobies..) i'm complaining about what the hell that has to do with anything? this film should have been kept on there hand cam at home as a joke....they suck..why was the blood more brown and turd like that real blood?...cheap i tells ya i mean everyone wasn't in colour they were just tinted yellow, and another thing that made me die laughing at this sad excuse for a film was the fact that they tried to pretend the clown was a woman all the time, although its clearly a flat chested black short haired man...did anyone else notice that the only special effect in this film was a slowed down jump..that was also poor oh and the dissolve effect that you can find on many basic p.c programs such as...powerpoint....this film blows

well, what can i say. what the f**k? there really isn't much to say about this, really. the only way you would like this is if u, like me, like bad bad horror to laugh at.acting- very unconvincing! just watch the last scene with the main actresses running! rip-off of texas chainsaw massacre! but in a bad way! just awful!gore- really not believable. in one scene they use one of those knives which have a chunk cut out of them which fit over a body part etc. by using this,with the addition of red ketchup, its supposed 2 look real, although it really doesn't.plot- predictable 'kids get lost in woods on camping weekend' movie ripped off from friday the 13th.killer quality- scary mask if you're scared of clowns, kinda unbelievable that someone would chose this as their costume however. the director obviously realised all the good costumes had been used in all the other horror-camp movies out there.total- 3/10 */***** p.s- stay away from camp blood ii, that one made this look like lord of the rings.

but i can't say how i really feel about this pile of steaming dung. where to begin. the film quality, there isn't any. i've seen clearer pictures on america's funniest home videos! the acting is substandard, the gore effects is okay. the clown mask is the best part of this movie, the story is repetitive. the same thing over and over again. at least in a friday the 13th or halloween we stick with one main character for the most part. there is no main characters, just victims. man, now we come to the worst part of all. the final survivor kills the clown and finds out it was one of her friends. then when the police finally arrive, they don't believe her and she is locked up in a rubber room. what kind of ending do you call that, crap, that's what. in my opinion, there is no excuse for a bad ending in a horror movie, that was just sloppy writing. the excuse, "it has to ending badly, it's a horror movie." or "we need to end it badly to leave it open to a sequel" are just lame excuses and that is all. i must give the camp blood the thanksgiving turkey.

yes sure, this is a friday the 13th rip off but i have no problem with it. it's a good effort, the killings aren't that gory but the acting of one girl carries the movie, what a scream queen, jennifer ritchkoff. for a low budget movie the effects are nicely done, okay, sometimes you can guess how it is done. some people have problems with the use of the camera, i can't see what's wrong with that. it's so strange that so many people dislike this movie, i really enjoyed it. of course the script isn't original but give me one that is, i mean, so many slashers are made in the woods. maybe it is all predictable but it's a worth see, i have seen a lot worser, i can tell you that

how to round up every possible cliché and stereotype existing in the genre of horror and then subsequently stuff them into one massively lousy movie? the answer: "camp blood". this is amateurish slasher nonsense made on a micro-budget and a little bit too obvious inspired by "friday the 13th". four of the most intolerable teenage characters you'll ever see  they're like a combination of ugly, stupid and annoying  go camping and quickly find themselves pursued by a homicidal maniac in a clown suit. don't even ask me what the killer's motivations were or even who he/she was, because if it did feature in the film, i totally missed it. this is one of the worst movies ever made, with no inspiration or craftsmanship whatsoever. the production values were so pitiable that there are actors playing multiple roles without even bothering to make them unrecognizable. the only half-decent and worthwhile sequence throughout the whole of "camp blood" is the opening in which the impressively voluptuous meredith o'brien has sex in the woods with her geeky boy scout. yes, i'm fully aware that this is a totally shallow remark to make, but then again this is a juvenile and retarded film, so who cares?

it's a puzzle to me how this turd of a film ever got distribution.sure, it's horror and there's a fair share of nudity, but by god, the production value is the lowest i've ever seen, the equipment used is worse than standard home equipment, everything is overlit, giving everything an amateurish look, bringing your thought to america's worst home video's or whatever that show was called..please people, is it too much to ask that you actually do an effort when you expect to waste 90 minutes of peoples lives watching this? you really should have done some short projects first cause it's obvious you're a bunch of amateurs! 1/10

camp blood is an absolutely atrocious slasher film. we're mixing friday the 13th with the blair witch project and adding....a killer in a clown mask.the budget for this film must have been very low, some of the actors played multiple parts and the camera used produced a picture equal to the colourised version of the original night of the living dead, which if anybody has watched that version will back me up that it is poor.this film was just so bad. there is nothing in the film even worth watching. the very fact i watched this all the way through stunned me. just take my advice and don't buy or rent this film. it is appalling.

1st watched 7/19/2003 - 1 out of 10(dir-brad sykes): ridiculously lame 3d movie which pretty much follows the plots of many 80's teen slasher flicks. stupid kids go to a known murderous camp site, become hunted by an unknown masked man, and then we try to figure out who, if anyone, is going to live. we really don't care who's behind the mask but even that's not hard to figure out if you've seen any of these kinds of movies. what a waste of a 3d viewer despite somewhat decent 3d effects.

i must first mention that as a group of mates, we often find entertainment in wacthing films which are known to be terrible for comedy value, hence our rental of camp blood.camp blood was the first film which we'd rented that had been shot on what looks to be a camcorder, and was so rubbish it wans't even funny.the dvd was returned and a refund was demanded, with the added suggestion some sort of quality control is implemented to prevent such utter rubbish being stocked.don't do what i did, and let the curiosity get the better of you, it's so bad it's not even funny.

idiots go camping and act like idiots before they finally die like idiots, yes camp blood (or if you're wanting an awful, badder than bad pun that suits a badder than bad film, "camp bloody awful"), is so bad it's actually quite depressing to watch. and it has all the ingredients to be a perfectly bad film... awful acting-check. bad script-check. tacky effects-check no originality whatsoever-double check. it doesn't even attempt to be different, and is riddled with every predicted cliché imaginable. for example, the film opens to a couple having sex in the woods, so of course they end up dead. one of the most disturbing things is that this film actually spawned two sequels, how and why only baffles the mind. just stay away from this one.

camp blood looked great when i was buying it, but when i watched it boy was i wrong. its tacky, the acting is outrageous and the quality of the film is shocking. being a movie fan, i usually find humour from tragic horror, but at times i couldn't even laugh. maybe camp blood 2 will be an improvement.

i am a fan of slasher movies, especially of scream 1-3, but this one is just one killing after another. to my astonishment: part ii is far better and you get the whole story of part one summarized! so don't waste time on this one and move right on to part ii, you won't regret it cause part 2 actually has a plot and is quite self-ironical. first part: 1 out of 10 second part: 4 out of 10

this movie had an excellent premise, and could have been a fascinating look at racism, attitudes to women at work and male female relations in england early last century. however, it simply turned into a soppy love story. but what was worse, is that the love story was totally unbelievable. the acting was for the most part poor, the direction confusing, but most of all the screenplay and the story were non-existent. the only thing i liked about the film was how dark it must have been before electric lighting. i really got a sense of just how little light one candle puts out.

i wanted to like this one - the situation was rich, and the setting unusual and interesting. but the story is swamped with childish female gothic romance elements that are hard to swallow. the director is unfairly prejudiced against the 'goy' characters -- content to let them be grotesque cardboard caricatures -- and inexplicably indulgent towards the homewrecking behavior of the heroine. the potentially interesting power struggle between the inventor and the governess is not really dealt with.feminist film makers will get more credibility when they stop manipulating situations to throw all the sympathy to the heroine, and start dealing honestly with issues. this movie more closely resembles 'the 7 pieces of gold', another earnest failure, more than 'the piano' - a real tale of passion.

*****spoilers*********this movie was truly awful. this woman deceives her employers right from the start and then selfishly proceeds to tear them apart. at the end you see her making a profession out of the trade she'd learned from the father of her "pupil". i put pupil in quotes because the governess never really seems to teach the child anything. she seems to hate her and can't stand being near her. i felt sorry for the little girl who simply wanted to be loved, absent that, it was understandable that she would say and do outrages things just to get attention but the viewer wasn't supposed to sympathize with the little girl, the viewer was supposed to sympathize with the governess who hated her pupil and manipulated and deceived her employers. i just couldn't do it. this was not the story of a self made woman, rather, it was a window into the mind of one who uses others at every opportunity with no other thought for anyone outside of her own family. i couldn't stand the governess! this was a really horrible movie. i only paid one dollar to rent it but even that was too much!

first, what is really great about this movie: - ryan reynolds, great acting! there are very few actors i really like and for now he is one of them. he has an amazing skill to impersonate characters. - the soundtrack! very good music played at the right time. - the idea of a nine lost in his own world, incapable of leaving. still, i give it only a 3 out of 10 for certain flaws: - horrible second part. it seems that the director was very eager to make something new, but despite of the efforts it was really boring - very annoying character melissa. i couldn't stand the scenes with her - i.e. it was constantly annoying. she represents everything that is wrong with american woman. - terrible explanation of the numbers. the director was so busy with character development, that he completely missed the point of a good story.. excuse me koalas? brr... terrible!this movie had great potential. the filming is nicely done, the music is really good, but nothing more.see it only if you are a fan of ryan reynolds, or have a lot of time to spare.

i really like ryan reynolds and hope davis and i actually had high hopes watching this last night on dvd. mainly as i try to avoid reviews until i watch something myself and form my own opinion big mistake! my 2 /10 is for the first segment which in fairness is actually quite decent and if they had made the movie about the characters in section 1 alone it may have risen above the 5/10 mark.once it moved into tv 'reality show' territory it stank to high heaven. ryan reynolds captured the essence of an actor on the edge wonderfully but as a gay tv writer and famous games creator / devoted family man he was definitely less effective. from the blurb on the box i expected a flashback thriller along the lines of 'memento' - unfortunately this is nowhere near that standard of movie.

i haven't reviewed anything on here for quite awhile, but after having the misfortune to sit through this rubbish masquarading as entertainment i had to put forward my thoughts.normally, however bad something is, there is one redeeming part, whether it is an actor who was okay, a scene that was passable, an attractive cast member, or a general feelgood moment. unfortunately, that isn't true here, as the film starts of atrociously, with a ridiculous shootout, which was so poor, i thought it was a practice, & two halfwits, otherwise known as the boys in blue chatting beside a school.one of these idiots was daniel baldwin, who not only starred in this, but also actually directed this garbage, & unlike his brothers cannot act for toffee. not that he was on his own here, as everyone in it seemed to belong to the acting school of a trained chimp.luckily, certainly for me, i only watched an hour of this masterpiece, as the dvd wouldn't work, & was probably made by the same fools who produced this. so if you have nothing to do but watch paint dry do watch this as it is just as boring, & ideal for getting rid of unwanted guests.

consider "i know all" action hero is lighting a cigarette in the darkness. while tries to hide/seek the bad guys. (probably to give a signal light to say here i am coming)that's one of the 100 scenes you can laugh at. (i think the movie should in the comedy category.)awful directing, awful script, bad acting, cheap special effects. (they used a tunnel so they can hide there acting in darkness)3 out of 10 (that also for making me laugh looking at those pathetic mistakes)

this is perhaps the worst movie i have ever seen, and i have seen well over 300 movies in my lifetime. the acting atrocious, the only bright spot seems to be judging the anatomical prowess of the female castmembers. after watching this movie, it is suggested that the viewer not operate heavy machinery or go driving for a period of at least 24 hours. also a bottle of valium would be recommended so you don't feel so bad for the 100 wasted minutes of your life. the plot is nothing original, the dialog excruciating, and even the weapons seem sub-par. do yourself a favor and go to your local blockbuster and burn whatever copies they have of this horrid film.

to start out with, the script is immitative and inane. the characters are shallow and formulaic. the plot has arbitrary reversals and non sequitors. baldwin's direction is terrible -- these actors could do better on their own. the jokes and wisecracks fall flat. the shoot out scenes are clumsy and incredible. baldwin directs himself as the wise courageous hero but spends most of his time in power struggles with women, particularly with the caricatured repressedwoman in their tunnel team who is always asking for and denying reassurance. the conductor suffer from absurd incompetence, being unable to effectively employ a pistol he has come by.anomalies: a hooded man bristleing with guns stalks through a railroad car, startling people. the next time we see them they are going about their business sitting in their seats, talking, eating, reading, knitting.in the new york subways folks sometimes come on the train to do some musical or dramatic number --- maybe that's what they thought the "happening" was.

this is one of the worst anime series i have ever seen. when i watched the manga review in a magazine, i thought it was maybe interesting, but when i got the chapters i realized it was a complete stupidity.ok, the first 2 or 3 chapters are ok, and the series have an standard. but as the plot advances, it becomes totally incoherent. the series tries to show some mystical based upon the christian mythologies, but it's a total stupidity. it features some demons and stigmata scenes... totally nonsense. it seems the series tries to seem deeply-thought, complex or mythologically reviewed, but a watcher with a bit of brain and cultural references, will realize soon all those elements used don't have a real sense: they are put there only to impress the ignorant watchers!!the final chapters are full of totally nonsense elements: battles with cat-eared demons, references to a supposed fight between demons, and demons who controls time (with no apparent reason). the final is totally nonsense; an ignorant watcher will see on it a floating final that gives them a place to meditate; but the truth is this: the final and the complete series is a total incoherent and incongruent nonsense.

cheesy 80's horror co-starring genre favs ken foree and rosalind cash along with brenda bakke are some of the featured players in this tale about a haunted health club. goofy dialogue and some nasty gore effects make this movie watchable. not bad but no great shakes either.recommended for the bad dialogue and acting. b-movie fans only.b

hated it with all my being. worst movie ever. mentally- scarred. help me. it was that bad.trust me!!!

what a waste of energy and money. what a waste of what talent there was.emilio estevez was completely wasted and mostly unused throughout. jon lovitz was very mildly amusing but pointless. harry dean stanton - why bother? and was it just me or can kari wuhrer barely act in this one.the story was pretty non-existent and really disjointed. one of my biggest problems was the reaction of the characters to the events that transpired. like the surf "dudes" giving up their lives every time they were threatened in the last half? how about that you never saw them surf once!! the set-up to some scenes took way to long with not enough pay-off to make us give a damn. nothing in this "movie" felt really true or genuine.the only good things i can say is some (very little) of the scenery was filmed nicely and a few scenes were mildly interesting. don't see this when there is so many better pointless movies out there.

usually i have a lot of luck with these small scale movies. i looked at the cast. leary, lovitz, delpy, wuhrer, estevez. how bad could it be? unfortunately the answer was...pretty bad. i have a hard time remembering a movie that had such poor execution of a plot that had potential.

i'll give it a two for denis leary. he had some good lines, but that's it. what was the point? where was the script? who was supposed to act? a movie needs more than this one has to offer. save the hour and a half to watch your hair grow, or fall out, whatever the case.

...out of this movie.sorry to say, this showed at the cleveland international film festival. our copy did not have subtitles, so i asked the festival crew if there was a problem with the print received. "not so..." i was told. "the director wants it this way". again, sorry to say, my french is barely high school elective level (more than 3 decades ago). much of the initial dialog is in french, so i'm sure i missed the nuance and many details in between my understanding of a few key words. i've rated this a "1", primarily because of the irony of a director who once worked doing subtitles refusing to put subtitles into a movie to be seen by an american audience. excuse me, even if most americans wouldn't know where europe was on a map, not even a film festival audience should be assumed to know "the native language" of a given movie. even if a few of us don't know finnish, i would still expect subtitles for the few "dolts" who aren't sophisticated enough to have expertise in the 37 different languages presented. i'll put up with this ego from david lynch, not from litvack.

almost a masterclass in how not to direct a movie. from the misjudged, often incomprehensible script onwards dr rey builds on a series of poor decisions that make the film an excruciating viewing experience. sadly the film never rises beyond a kind of old fashioned, almost misogynistic gay camp in which women are over-wrought, ott and middle aged and the men are young, vacuous and forever on the hunt for sex. the director was unable to pitch either the tone of the film or the level of the performances.there is certainly a great deal of 'acting' going on. dianne wiest slips into a pale impersonation of her bullets over broadway performance and poor old jane birkin flounders in her attempt to give a comic performance. though you have to pity her as there is very little real comedy here. the whole thing feels like a very low rent version of merchant ivory's le divorce which, to be quite honest, wasn't very good, either.

i don't even know where to start. i did not like it. it did not behave like a story and so much was injected into the movie (the pot brownies, the son was gay (?) the murder was justified, what possible reason could there be in the script for linda aka penelope to exist) that was never explained. it was all fluid spilled on a table and left dripping off the counter until it all made a big mess on the floor.why did vanessa redgrave make a five second cameo? why did diane wiest use her bullets over broadway character without the camp-fun? why was jane birkin in the storyline to begin with. the list is endless. the movie ended and we all looked at each other -- like -- did you understand any of this??i tell ya one thing, if i watched my long lost dad get murdered i certainly wouldn't be hugging the murderer. tell ya another thing, if "bob" broke up with "bob" what purpose did hiding the son in the closet have? was bob going to have sex with bob in front of the son? how did the murderer contact the son so easily? if this review sounds confused, it is because this was a waste of film, talent and time. what the heck did the dead shrink have to do with anything!!jezz, this is one of the worst films i have ever seen because it should have/could have been better, stronger and it should have made some kind of sense. any sense. instead we are given a watered down "diva" (the film from the 70s complete with a murder) and tired performances reading boring words from a script that is completely insane.by pass it folks. or maybe me and the rest of the people who reviewed this film are too stupid to understand it all -- i mean after all it is a french film.

one can only sit in utter amazement at this mess of a film and be amused at some of the raves people have bestowed upon it. the biggest problem seems to be the director's inability to make up his mind as to whether it's black comedy, farce or a combination of both. it meanders all over the place in search of direction and has some utterly embarrassing performances that might be better suited to bad sitcom. what a shame to see the talented dianne wiest's comic talents squandered and the ever annoying jane birkin is so over the top she's more bothersome than usual.perhaps a lot of the positive criticism is due to the "quirky french" nature of the film - therefore, it's labeled "smart" or "genius." it's neither. instead it's bad tripe that leaves a rather rancid after-taste. merchant-ivory should stick to the serious stuff as they certainly have no comprehension of comedy.

it would be a shame if tommy lee jones and robert duval ever see this movie as they will probably be associated with it in years to come. "oh yeah", the public will say, "'comanche moon', that's the mini series about the texas rangers and the comanche indians that starred tommy lee jones and robert duval. it was a real stinker and probably the worst movie they were ever in. i think it was a comedy but a not very funny comedy. i really don't understand why they agreed to be in it". that would be such an injustice as the original "lonesome dove" was a true western classic and this turkey is a real bomb and jones and duval will be remembered for it.

it was only a matter of time that a spoof would be made of sports movies! and there are plenty of movies to be spotted which are made fun off. but the biggest problem i had was the fact that it stays with recognizing movies. the director and writers of "the comebacks" somehow forget to get creative. while i must admit that i laughed at certain scenes,"the comebacks" could have been so much funnier. the actors forget to deliver their lines seriously and have a straight face throughout the movie. a spoof demands this and that is the main reason why silly jokes work in movies like this. because of the failure of the cast to do so the jokes never hit their mark. some scenes take forever and normally in spoofs that doesn't have to be a problem. take "naked gun" for instance. their is always something happening on screen. in "the comebacks" they didn't even bother to let stuff happening in the background. only a couple of factors make this movie worth watching! it still is fun to spot the movies that are made fun off. and jermaine williams as ipod. his parody on cuba gooding jr. as radio was hilarious! he seemed to be the only one in the cast to get the idea of what a spoof is about. not entirely bad!

a comedy that spoofs the inspirational sports movies, the comebacks tells the story of an out-of-luck coach, lambeau fields, who takes a rag-tag bunch of college misfits and drives them towards the football championships. in the process, this life-long loser discovers that he is a winner after all by redeeming himself, saving his relationship with his family and friends, and finding that there is indeed, no "i" in "team"!i decided to watch the unrated version for this film. it was thirty minutes longer and i though it may be better than the theatrical release, hearing that people hated this movie. after all, thirty minutes of extra footage can add a whole lot to a movie. well, i certainly was wrong. it was as bad as the recent "meet the spartans" but it was thirty minutes more of torture!seriously, who makes a close to two hour spoof movie?! a spoof movie is short because if it goes any longer, it would be overkill! honestly, i love stupid comedies. heck, i liked "date movie," "white chicks," "epic movie," and "little man"! i guess when it comes to spoof movies, it is either a hit or miss and this one definitely missed.on the lighter side, from the many jokes in this film, i will say about six or seven made me laugh, even some that made me laugh out loud. but that's not saying much. following those jokes were more scenes of torture and unfunniness.i can't see how people would say this is not a terrible spoof film. in fact, there is as much product placement in here like meet the spartans, there are as many dance sequences, and unfunny jokes. i will say another thing i like about this movie is the songs. they are some very good songs in here. overall, watch it if you like spoof films. skip it if you like funny films.

i watched all three segments and am so disappointed in the story line. zahn spends so much time mimicking duvall he does nothing else in the show. and tommy lee jones would never be so weak as a young man, unlikeable yes but weak never. we never see how or why they go to back to lonesome dove...which is a dirt hole in the original...why would they ever leave austin where they are hero's...for doing nothing during the whole movie...i was rooting for blue duck by the end of the movie and he was totally miscast. there is no warning about how many segments there are...it just ends. this mini-series could have been "somebody"...tragic. it looked like it was directed by the parrot and the jag

do all spoof films require pure stupidity and a lack of any sort of intelligence whatsoever to the humour? is there even just a single genuinely funny parody film anymore? all i see are zero-quality films that look like a couple stoned high school students got bored one day with a video camera. these movies are not funny, they're not clever, they're not entertaining, they're just useless in every conceivable way.the comebacks was a movie that tried to hide its hideous level of trash by not calling itself "sports movie". it's the same thing, though. there are a few different writers for these films, the wayans did some, freidberg and seltzer did some others, and i'm sure there's another pair. i can't even tell the difference in direction or humour to be honest, it all seems like the same people wrote and directed them. i can't tell if the comebacks was done by the people who did scary movie or the guys who did epic movie, or someone else, it's just the same jokes from all the others.if you have any shred of taste or value for humour, don't see this movie. if you have self-worth, don't bother seeing it. if you have any respect for film making, don't even consider watching it. don't see it in any broke down, derelict theatre that may still carry it, don't rent it, don't order it on netflix or pay-per-view, don't redbox it, and don't even watch it for free on od. avoid it like the plague.the only conceivable reasons i can see to watch this film are as follows.a. masochism. if you like torturing yourself, there's very few better ways. b. seeing a prime example of why to avoid anything that says "fox atomic". c. you're being paid considerably high amounts of cash.i really would not watch the entire thing if someone offered me $100 to do it. it's just mindless, mental collapsing torment.you might as well watch zohan.

for the record, i hate spoof movies. except for mel brooks and airplane! because those are classics and make fun of the clichés, not the actual movies itself. i think that spoof movies are the bottom of the barrel for both comedy and film. i especially hate things created by jason friedberg and aaron seltzer, the "geniuses" behind date movie, epic movie, and meet the spartans.i decided to give the comebacks a look. since friedberg and seltzer had nothing to do with the production, i was as objective as possible. it was just like one of their movies. it was basically every sports movie rolled into one with lame kindergarten jokes, and disturbing images of bodily injury that's supposed to make me laugh and failed.only someone high would laugh at these jokes. toilet bowl? who wrote this? an 11 year old? i was surprised to see that this was the creation of the producers of wedding crashers, which was actually pretty decent. but there attempt at the spoof genre was about as funny as a burning orphanage. the only reason that i gave this two stars (when it clearly deserved one) was because friedberg & seltzer had nothing to do with this.

when i first saw the trailer for the comebacks, it looked absolutely horrible and i had no interest in seeing it, but when it came out on dvd today, i figured since there was nothing else that caught my interest, i would rent it and give it a shot. i watched it tonite and it really wasn't that bad. i think it was immature and stupid at times, but there were a few funny moments that made me laugh. i don't really watch many sports movies, so i wonder maybe if i saw more, maybe this movie would make more sense to me, but it's all good, i still didn't mind so much watching the comebacks. i admit, these "stupid spoof" movies are lame, but what's the harm in a stupid joke every once in a while? the comebacks isn't really that bad if you give it a fair chance.coach fields is failing in life, family and career both, but when he is offered a chance to bring his career back to life if he can bring a looser football team into the championship. but the team is really really terrible, like beyond terrible. but with a little work and team effort they try to give it their all, even though that might turn into something more sad.the comebacks over all isn't the worst film i've seen, i think it's good for a couple laughs and giggles. i know that this was stupid, but i couldn't help but laugh when the coach comes in the middle of a fight in the locker room and he's beating the nerd's head against the locker, just him and the nerd in general were so funny together. if you have an open mind and don't take this movie too seriously, i think you'll have a fun time watching it, if you watch it expecting it to be oscar worthy material, this is not the movie for you.4/10

one would think that since this film has a bad rep that i would be exaggerating when i say i hated this film.but i'm am serious this movie was just so stupid and so unfunny, and such a waste of time.i mean after the first 30, i had a major headache and the smile i had on my face(that was mostly getting ready to laugh) was wearing off.when this film was over i was so glad and because i had good expectations that it would be funny i was extremely disappointed.the acting is not great, the comedy moments are lame and unfunny.hardly anything is good about this, because i laughed at like maybe 2 parts.overall this is so boring and i can't tell you how awful this is, i think this could be used as a suicide technique.i mean i don't think for some its even watchable.so my final words on this are, avoid at all costs.

1st movie comment ever! i'll start with saying "come on! wasn't that bad... was it?"... no it was't that bad actually. i laughed and giggled enough times through the movie so i cannot say with hand on my heart that it was rubbish.it's completely different, this and epic movie (epic movie sucked bad.. doh!). "how so?" people would ask. i'll tell you how. this movie is not as nearly as pointless, not to mention that the stupid (and i say stupid because it is, but being stupid makes it funny) stuff that happens around and with the characters is actually enjoyable in this movie. not the best around but hey... what would you expect - look at the poster! some people said it was stupid, i find that when writing a comment one should be more objective (my own opinion) but yeah, of course it was stupid, it's a movie about "stupid"! look, i'm not telling you to go and watch the movie now or else you missed the event of the century. what i am telling is that, if you happen to see the movie somewhere, please don't carve your eyes on the opening credits. see what it's all about - who knows, you might like it a bit.i give it 4/10 for not being so bad and making me laugh and some unexpectedly good sex-related jokes.

this movie is a terrible attempt at a spoof. its attempts to parody various sports movies are half-baked and not at all funny.even things that should be funny - like the female kicker from india who's always wearing traditional dress over her uniform - aren't really funny. the fact that the football team studies and gets good grades which makes the coach mad didn't get any laughs either.the plot of having a traditional loser get one more chance by coaching a loser high school football team really had potential as a spoof. it's a classic and trite sports theme. but alas, the screenplay was too weak for any cast to pull it off. and this cast is no exception.there is gratuitous use of women in bikinis and underwear, so it's not all bad from that aspect.but animal house or talladega nights, this is not.

this movie is one that belongs on the cutting room floor. for one, the opening sequence does not put forth the element of 'gang' related subject. if it wasn't supposed to then at least they got that part right. secondly...whats with all the glancing to the left and then to the right??? they even do it in synchronous style. nowhere have i witnessed a member from a rival crew walk up to a bar, look for someone, from the outside lookin like he is all that and a bag o chips at a barbie and walk away without even being confronted let alone get 'what for'. i wasted money on the rental price and am glad i did not purchase the dvd itself.if this was made by college( t.a.f.e ) students then at least they gave it the old aussie try. better luck next time.

i love watching australian movies but this steaming pile of crap was just plain embarrassing. the dvd cover looked promising but you know what they say, don't judge a dvd by it's cover. i also noticed that it won best actor for an award but the competition must have been really bad because the acting in this film is pathetic. it just seemed that the director thought he had enough talent to direct and act when he should really focus on one part of film-making and get it right before spreading himself too thin. the music was pretty ordinary. the story really didn't go anywhere. it was just a sequence of fights strung together with poor script and cheesy dialogue.i will say this to all aspiring filmmakers though. watch this film. it will give you hope that your film will win something at some festival.however, good on them for getting in there and having a go. hope they learned some lessons and their next venture is a little better.

although i watched this film by myself(thankfully), i still felt embarrassed while watching it. i was tricked into renting it by the reviews on the front cover, and the bloody/gritty camera stills on the back-which led me to believe it was some sort of documentary. these actors are laughable throughout the entire film, not convincing at all. the story involves an italian australian(?) gang, just fighting other gangs, and then running,fighting,repeat. supposedly they train extremely hard, which makes them way better than other gangs. for some reason i don't believe that they could actually beat up some of these other guys that are twice their size. i could be wrong... no i'm not wrong, this movie is not enjoyable on any level.the jail montage looked like it was a summer camp, just instead of kids, it was a sausage fest of horrible actors, just hanging out and laughing and trying to look hard. this movie is not worth your time, save your money, or throw it in the garbage, just don't waste it on this movie.

for those of you who don't remember movies -- http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080120/ -- this came out in '79 ( i guess enough time has gone by so naturally nunzio figured he could just redo this and say he wrote it - yea, right! ).the acting in this is way overboard - the "tough guys" walk around with their shoulders hunched forward to give the impression they are bigger than they really are, also the "hero' seems to have a passion for snorting, and rolling his eyes in a bug-eyed kind of way to express angst/anger to the celluloid eye.there is a sort of racial message here, from the sicilian perspective (mind you this is about 3rd generation down the line... the original "wogs" arrived in oz after the war and during my childhood - yep i'm an aussie. so the "wogg-iness" has been diluted a lot - they even sound like true-blue aussies - not a flicker of the "dago accent" anywhere ( there, there's another slang for ya, nun! )maori's with sunnies (sunglasses) at 4am - must be cool to be sun-blinded in the middle of the night and it looks like redfern... this is at this movie's tedious end. nunzio tried to copy the flavor of the warriors but, left too many holes in the story. how about coincidences ?the warriors had a gang of baseball guys wielding bats, with white face makeup chase the heroes to a train station and fight them - nunzios gang get chased on a railway station by a gang of stick wielding guys wearing whitish face masks. the warriors were mistakenly accused of shooting/murdering another gang-member -- nunzios gang are mistakenly accused of raping the sister of the big maori gang boss. the warriors are lured into a room by a gang of girls who attack them - nunzios crowd want to crash at a friends house, which is populated by, yep, a gang of girls -- there are almost too many copies from the warriors to keep on about here.i am saddened that people don't want to see other moves from oz because of this tripe - how about mad max - commander and master of the world? not all movies are made by actors who are so bad, they have to fund their own movies. as far as the other actors in this show are concerned, they seem to have taken their cue from "the nun" as they all are as bad as each other - don't bother with this movie! i can't get my money back - so save yours!

let's face it, a truly awful movie, no...i mean a "truly" awful movie, is a rare, strange, and beautiful thing to behold. i admite that there is a special place in my heart for films like plan 9 from outer space, half caste, species, etc. and although i'm giving this film a 1, i highly urge anyone who enjoys a bad film for what it truly is (a bad film) to find a friend, snacks, something to drink, and make the special occasion it deserves out of: aussie park boyz. from the very first moments of the lead actor's side to side eye-rolling performance as he attempts to inject intensity directly into the film without ever looking at a camera (a slice of ham straight out of silent pictures--eat your heart out rudolph valentino) to the sudden hey-we're-out-of-film conclusion, you...will...not...stop...laughing. to sum the film up, its a poor man's warriors down under, complete--and that description alone should be enough, but then comes the wonders of "the spaghetti eating scene", "the 'we've got their tickets; they won't be leaving town now' scene", "it's the asians! run!!" and more. the only truly objectionable part is a gratuitously filmed rape. outside of this, i dare you to watch this film. and i dare you to find evidence of acting, or lines, or direction, or any of those other boring and superfluous elements that so-called critics say a film needs to be judged as good. if this movie doesn't cause fits of uncontrollable laughter before it ends, all i can do is roll my eyes menacingly from side to side at you and shout, "you dog! you dog! you dog!"

film critics of the world, i apologize. it is your job to give advice to the moviegoing public so that they can wisely choose what to spend money on. but i ignored your advice and i have been deeply hurt. however, my decision to see "the cat in the hat" wasn't made haphazardly. you see, three years ago all of you critics said that we should all avoid the "calamity" known as "how the grinch stole christmas". then some friends of mine took me to see it and it turned out to be a colorful, funny and almost hypnotic yuletide treat. so when the critics unleashed their fury against "the cat in the hat", another big budget seuss update with a big name star in the title role, i thought that it must be the same old song. how wrong i was.for five whole minutes i thought i was in the clear. the opening credits are clever, the kids are charming and the production values are top notch. then the cat showed up. there are many problems from this point on, but the biggest one was the woeful miscasting of mike myers. where "the grinch" was saved by the inspired casting of jim carrey, "the cat" was destroyed by myers. he can be very funny when his energies are applied where they belong, comic sketches. every movie he's made that was truly funny was really just a feature length comedy sketch, from "wayne's world" to "austin powers". so he tries to do the same thing here, it's just that these comedy sketches are more like the stuff that they stick at the end of snl, not funny, just painful. not that the writers helped him out any. after the charming prologue the movie turns into an hour of repulsive bodily humor gags, poorly timed pratfalls and insultingly stunted attempts at hip humor. this movie was the most disheartening cinematic experience i have ever had. period. so much talent and work went into something so vile. i know that the adult stars of this movie will be relatively unscathed by this mess, i just hope that the wonderful spencer breslin and dakota fanning will get more chances to show their charms in far better movies. if you are a parent, please avoid this like the plague. with movies like "elf" and "brother bear" currently in theaters, you have far better choices.

don't get me wrong, i assumed this movie would be stupid, i honestly did, i gave it an incredibly low standard to meet. the only reason i even saw it was because there were a bunch of girls going (different story for a different time). as i began watching i noticed something, this film was terrible. now there are two types of terrible, there's freddy vs. jason terrible, where you and your friends sit back and laugh and joke about how terrible it is, and then there is a movie like this. the cat in the hat failed to create even a momentary interest in me. as i watched the first bit of it not only was i bored senseless, but i felt as though i had in some way been violated by the horrendousness of said movie. mike myers is usually brilliant, i love the majority of his work, but something in this movie didn't click. one of the things that the director/producers/writers/whatevers changed was that they refused to use any of the colors of the original book (red, black, white) on any character but the cat. coincidentally or not, they also refused to capture any of the original (and i hate to use this word, but it fits) zaniness of the original. the book was like an ice cream sunday, colorful and delicious, and the movie was about as bland and hard to swallow as sawdust.avoid this like a leprous prostitute.

there is no way to avoid a comparison between the cat in the hat and the grinch who stole christmas, so let's get that part out of the way. first of all, let me start by saying that i think grinch was an underrated and unappreciated film. cat was... well, just awful.jim carey was cast because he is a brilliant physical comedian, and fearlessly commits to over the top, outrageous characters. mike myers fell back on his old bag of tricks.why, why, why mike myers?? the kids could care less, and the austin powers demographic isn't going to spy this film. so, what was the studio thinking?the cat was also apparently related to linda richmond. can we talk? why a new york accent? not entirely consistent with anything dr. seuss has ever written. myers was even allowed to sneak in his scottish shtick. i wonder how many different voices the director and the studio tried to edit out of before they just gave in and said "as long as you don't say fahklempt', you can keep the accents." meyers never seemed to find any sort of comfort, either with the costume, make-up, or dialogue.the jokes, what few there were, were crude and age inappropriate. when myers picks up a garden hoe and delivers to the camera: "dirty ho", everything but the rim shot was missing, and even that wouldn't have helped.the same folks who created 'whoville', clearly had a hand in the creation of the town and the houses in 'cat'. the sets and props were very appealing, giving the viewer a much needed distraction from the bad writing, direction, and myers.there was some fun to be had with alec baldwin and kelly preston. dakota fanning was the only actor who seemed to be aware she was in a movie based on a dr. seuss classic, and stayed true to the genre.call the spca. this cat should be neutered and never be allowed to reproduce again. please, please, no sequel.

what to say about this movie? a married couple has more then just each other. after playing around for some time things gets more serious. a difficult choice has to be made: continue the old situation or start all over by following the heart. guess what happens at the end. this movie seems to be very low budget. but a good story don't have to be expensive. it looks like a play that has been converted to a movie only by using several cheap locations (at least very little other people visible) more than just the stage, in this one the house. from the first minute future developments are clear as water. nothing unexpected happens. sometimes you may think watching a soft porn movie, in which case you know in advance that there's no story. i find this movie disappointing so that's explains the vote (4).

"love life" explores a very culturally relevant scenario of a marriage of convenience between a lesbian and a gay man. i found the subject matter compelling, even if the conflict was a bit forced and too easily resolved. for example, thomas falls for joe a little too quickly and conveniently for the plot. there are many continuity errors: one other user commented on different cars in the garage, joe's glasses...the one that got to me the most was the fact joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene. in the end, i found myself more turned-on by this movie than moved. stephan d. gill has a pretty nice body and shows it all quite a few times with pornstar skill and exuberance, and all-too-often acting chops to match. many times, the movie seems like it is going to go full-on porn. stephanie kirchen does a fine job, but her moment of enlightenment at the end was sullied a bit for me, since i was in the mood for a good romp in the shower by the end of this movie.

my expectations were high after seeing the trailer. they were even higher when i saw the movie had the same director as independance day and godzilla. the special effects in independence day were much better then in this movie. the whole movie i was waiting for the spiders to show up. the rest of the storyline was really boring. and when the spiders came, they had a very amateuristic look, like the special effects were from a movie made in the 60's. i didn't watch the whole movie. when it was played for about one hour i switched off my dvd-player. i watch 3 movies almost every night, and i have never walked away from a movie, even if it was that boring. the only thing good in this movie was the pretty sheriff :) that's why i voted 2 instead of 1 :) so don't go see this one, instead you should go out and rent starship troopers, it's like the same only 10.000 times better.

with david arquette starring you would immediately think this to be a stupid movie. well, it is a stupid movie with a horrid script. but the f/x, namely the eight legged freaks, makes this flick a hoot to watch. a tribute, albeit on the silly side, to those great mutant creature features of the 50s. arquette and sheriff sam(kari wuhrer)summon help in fighting off the toxic waste induced giant spiders wreaking havoc on their tiny town in arizona. also in the cast are doug e. doug, rick overton, leon rippy and the charming scarlett johansson.

i hope this isn't a portent of things to come. high-definition camcorders are getting cheaper all the time (although i wouldn't swear that's what was used here), so it's open season for all the wannabe scorseses and tarantinos.there is no hiding the cheapness of this stinker, and calling it a 'film' would be doing the industry a big disservice. the photography is of a standard you would expect on a family outing to the zoo. i could build me a new house with all the wooden acting. what's remarkable about that is that nobody stands out as the worst. they are all equally terrible. like a whole bunch of ben afflecks. or steven seagals.what hooked me was the title. i'm a sucker for this sort of thing, like frankenhooker, or monsturd. frankenhooker was pretty bad, too, but at least i got some laughs out of it, and the acting was merely bad, not awful. i can't comment on monsturd as i've yet to get hold of a copy of it.anyway, i hope the people who made this didn't make any money from it. else they might be encouraged to try it on again. please, guys, pawn the camcorder and go back to your regular job.

go get your camcorder, your little brother, and the disturbing neighbor next door who throws boiling water on raccoons; and you got yourself a film! well, that's what these guys thought anyway. it was so bad i can't even remember the majority of it except for flashbacks comparable to someone who toured in 'nam. despite the really corny title, the horrible quality, the terrible actors, and the cliché writing, i think this movie isn't the worst i've ever seen. i'm saving that slot for everything with steven seagal, chuck norris and jean-claude van dam. anyhow, if you are out of options when it comes to finding new "horror" films that you haven't seen 1,000 times already, (as i was) and you are debating this one, i would still skip this. it had absolutely no redeeming qualities. this mock serial killer thriller was a weak, puny attempt at an even b film. if they're really lucky it might make the wal-mart $4.50 bin. but, i highly doubt it.

the movie was pretty bad. it's not so much a script problem. it's just that the movie is really boring in terms of pacing. the movie just seems to plod along at a slow, agonizing rate. the story in san franpsycho is that there's a serial killer on the loose who is killing morally corrupt individuals (maybe i read too much into it, but hey, it's my nature apparently) after the san franpsycho kills a pair of people under the golden gate bridge we're introduced to one of the main characters of the film: joe estevez (brother of martin sheen) as a curmudgeony cop named bill culp. bill is currently trying to hunt down the killer (seriously he doesn't have a name, he's just the killer), and he is trying to coerce a local news reporter named rita to help him with his investigation, bill is the stereotypical hard-edged cop and he threatens rita to throw her in jail for obstruction of justice. anyway a few scenes pass by and suddenly rita finds a letter left by the psychopath (he's a cold blooded psychopath!) and she has a change of heart and tells bill and his partner joe about it and help them with the investigation.the movie tries to be a taut murder-thriller, but sort of just fails at that. it's much like the movie the black dahlia it tries to be tense but it just is unbelievable in terms of that. the movie tries to be serious throughout, but it has scenes like where the killer masturbates (obviously a fan of gore porn what with lines like: "ooh blood on her" or something to that effect) and joe estevez hitting the table going: "he's a cold blooded murderer!" i admit to chuckling more than once at the movie, even though i'm sure it was intended to be a deadly serious movie.one of the only positive points the movie has going for it is the fact that i didn't pay money to see it (huzzah netflix). and it's sad because i could see some good in their movies after watching the damned. sure the movie had its fair share of flaws, but it was enjoyable. sadly though san franpsycho has nothing going for it. granted it has an okay script it's nothing too grand, but it could've been interesting. instead what you get is a murder thriller that fails to thrill or have even vaguely enjoyable deaths. also the other reviews claim that the movie has "a great twist ending that's shocking" apparently i was watching a different movie because by about the one hour mark i sort of figured out what was going to happen. the ending didn't shock me in the least bit. i would go on insulting this wreck of a movie but i don't think i will. long story short this movie is a boring uninspired thriller (i use that term loosely) that fails to have the "hitchcockian thrills" that another reviewer claims to have a predictable ending, bland deaths, acting with all of the emotion of a plank of wood, and a decent soundtrack.i'm sure others will try to defend this with the usual: it was a low budget movie, they did the best they could with such a low budget, and all that other nonsense. but when you get right down to it there was very little that they could've really spent that budget on, there was very little special effects work, the soundtrack sounds like it might've been recycled from hood of the living dead or the damned, and it's the same damn crew from those two films. this movie really reminds me a lot of another low budget flick that was no good, and it was called mr. jingles, the two are about the same quality, they fail to deliver anything close to enjoyment and should fade quickly into obscurity.

san franpyscho: 1 out of 10: so you want to make a serial killer movie. but your budget is non-existent, your camera equipment is elderly and your stars are joe estevez (martin sheen's younger brother and a staple in really bad movies) and todd bridges from different strokes. there are probably ways to pull of at least a watchable film. the quiroz brothers have no clue.first of all much of the cast seems to have been chosen in a desperate attempt to make bridges and estevez look like oscar caliber thespians. really how hard is it to play a priest or an overbearing mother? certainly a city the size of san francisco has a few professional actors willing to work for a few bucks and a screen credit. clearly chris angelo and bonnie steiger who play these roles have other talents such as landscaper or waitress they ought to be fine tuning.joe rosete as the killer (yes the serial killer is simply known as "the killer") is also pretty awful in a mentally ill method kind of way but i am almost willing to give him the benefit of the doubt as his character is written with zero style or personality. a boring almost laughable serial killer is a problem for a serial killer movie.in addition the quiroz brothers seem to have originally planned this as an abc family movie of the week. there is no nudity or violence to speak of and the r rating clearly is for the adult style pacing. this move meanders like an 85 year old woman driving with wraparound sunglasses and her turn signal on. the only occasional horror comes from lighting estevez's face with a glare that makes it look like his lower jaw was removed.i wasn't expecting a great film when i rented san franpyscho but i wasn't expecting mind numbing boredom either.

without a shadow of a doubt this is and probably will always be the worst film i have ever had the missfortune to see my whole life. take 5 wooden actors who got thrown out of acting school because they were so wooden someone sat on them thinking they were a bench.then add a cheap camcorder. you know the old vhs types that cost £20 on ebay. add a terrible story line with no effects and yes you have this film. what a shocker it was. they couldn't even save it by having a fit girl in it. she was fat and ugly and was the worst of all. i actually watched it all as i could not believe this crap ever got funded.miss at all costs

this is one of the most laughably bad films i've ever seen. i cannot believe whoever wrote the review above was serious. perhaps he was connected with making it. it doesn't have anything going for it. there is no suspense, the acting is dire, the direction hopeless. the music score (?) is three trite notes played ad nauseam. the plot (?) must have taken all of five minutes to write. the dialogue is what a 10-year-old would come up with if asked to do a homework project. the only (slightly) redeeming feature is the actor playing the psycho himself, who grimaces, trembles and gurns magnificently and thus is amusing at times. the only reason you would be on the edge of your seat would be if you were suffering from a weak bladder. don't waste your time.

this terrible moovie is fun on many levels - the moost obvious is the lame, fake-looking bird puppet which floats around the cheap sets, without ever flapping it wings (like it was on a string, perhaps?), attacking model trains and toy cars. the "science" is asinine - a masonic atom gun?? and what's up with the enormous amounts of brylcream in everyone's hair? i guess the 50's were the slimeball decade! well, this bird puppet apparently comes from "some god-forsaken anti-matter universe", and it's here to build a nest & lay eggs in new york. seriously. that they manage to kill the puppet is almost a shame. i give it 1 hoof out of 4 - it's silly and stupid, but moore fun than armageddon. :=8)

this is a truly terrible sci-fi/horror film from 1957. in fact, despite ed wood, jr.and his dreadful films getting a lot of publicity, this turkey is every bit as bad as the worst of wood. now the acting is a bit better than you'd find in the wood epics (such as plan 9 and bride of the monster), but the special effects managed to be significantly worse than wood's! however, bad movie aficionados will be happy to hear that it's so bad that it's still excellent viewing. like a wood film, it's great to watch this crap-fest and laugh along with your friends.the film begins with a scientist flying about doing some testing in his jet. however, out of nowhere, a ufo streaks by and his report of this over the radio triggers a panic by the air force. however, later, they realized that the ufo didn't appear on the radio and they think the scientist is a nut! but, when soon after this planes start disappearing all over, they realize there must be something to his sighting.so far, the film isn't great but it's watchable. however, by the time the horrible flying monster appears, you know you're watching a turkey. first, through horrid use of stock film and crappy models, airplanes keep changing mid-flight. some may not be bothered by this, but with airplane lovers like me, seeing an f-80 turning into an f-86 to an f-102 fighter plane made me crazy--especially since the planes look nothing like each other. second, through "clever" cinematography, all you really see of the monster is a ball of fuzz for half the film! this is frustrating and you hope that when you finally do see it clearly, it will be worth the wait. well, no such luck!! the "monster" looks less realistic or scary than the duck from groucho's "you bet your life" tv show!! in fact, it's significantly less realistic than any of the japanese giant monsters!! in fact, big bird from "sesame street" is even a bit scarier and realistic!!! it's just god-awful in every way and might just be the dumbest movie monster in history--about as bad (or worse) as the monsters in robot monster or teenagers from outer space!!! the bottom line is that this is an absolutely dreadful film that sane people won't like. bad film fans like me (who are a crazy bunch) will probably love it! all others...be afraid,....be very afraid!!fyi--you might notice that some clips in this film are from other sci-fi movies!! i am positive the crashing washington monument scene was stolen from earth vs. the flying saucers but i also saw a couple other scenes that i swear are from other films. what a hack job!

before we start, may i say i hope you've already eaten when you're reading this. why? because, after i'd seen this film for the first time, the bird's look and sound made me want to eat chicken after the words 'the end' had appeared on the screen. so don't say you weren't warned.fred sears might have directed "earth vs. the flying saucers" (an okay film and one of the bigger examples for tim burton's "mars attacks"), but "the giant claw" is not that giant a film. yes, it's a prehistoric monster that flies in the air, attacks planes and cities and occasionally treats itself to a man on a parachute. the beast is giant except in the scenes where it's considerably smaller, but who needs consistent proportions in a movie? scary? it could have been, but not if the plot is hopelessly silly and the monster looks like like a puppet that ran away from sesame street.

the giant claw is in fierce competition with films like, 'robot monster' and 'plan 9 from outer space' for worst film of all time. a phony looking giant vulture attacks 'lionel trains' in this completely unconscious film. the script is so bad that everything the characters say to one another is ridiculous. it's no wonder that this film is a prime target in the movie, "it came from hollywood," where this gem is hammered for the line, 'a bird as big as a battleship', with gleeful, endless needling. the line pops up relentlessly through the course of the film, so there's no escaping it. there are several shots from, 'the beast from 20,000 fathoms' and 'earth vs. the flying saucers' among other sci-fi films from the 50's to beef up the scraggly vulture's attacks. at one point the big vulture is responsible for a few deaths, so the military puts the entire world under martial law and no one is allowed to go out of their homes. of course, the huge buzzard is mainly concerned with pursuing the stars of this classic, jeff morrow & mara corday, wherever they might be. yet the director is so lame that he doesn't even provide for a few honey shots of pretty mara in a decent dress and black heels for a little relief from the tedium of this zero star thriller. that's the second time this blunder has been made. in 'tarantula', mara corday struts around in hot dresses for the whole film, but is relegated to pants throughout, 'the giant scorpion'. the budget for this film must have been not more than thirty or forty thousand dollars and i doubt whether morrow or corday got more than three thousand to make it. it looks like the whole thing was shot right out of somebody's garage.

i saw this movie when i was about 12 when it came out. i recall the scariest scene was the big bird eating men dangling helplessly from parachutes right out of the air. the horror. the horror.as a young kid going to these cheesy b films on saturday afternoons, i still was tired of the formula for these monster type movies that usually included the hero, a beautiful woman who might be the daughter of a professor and a happy resolution when the monster died in the end. i didn't care much for the romantic angle as a 12 year old and the predictable plots. i love them now for the unintentional humor.but, about a year or so later, i saw psycho when it came out and i loved that the star, janet leigh, was bumped off early in the film. i sat up and took notice at that point. since screenwriters are making up the story, make it up to be as scary as possible and not from a well-worn formula. there are no rules.

i wish i could have voted this movie a ten, it's that funny. if they had intended for it to be that funny i would have given it a ten. i have to give it a 1, but it's the funniest darn 1 you'll ever want to watch. see the giant blur flash across the screen! where did it come from? what is it? it flies, it terrifies, it's electrifying, it's on strings! this bird has real personality. i was about ten when i saw it for the first time, and when big bird appeared on sesame street, i was sure they were one and the same!

this is one awful movie!! some people told me that it was not that bad actually but i sure disagree! the monster is amazingly cheap (and funny) looking but this is something we all knew i guess. in addition to that, the dialogs are awful and the writing is just plain terrible.as bad as it is, this movie as the quality of being entertaining. not always for the good reasons but it's a good "so bad that it's fun" flick.by the way, there's no such thing as "la castagne". according to a secondary character in the film named pierre (described in the movie as a french canadian), there's a legend among french canadians about a giant bird know as "la castagne". as a french canadian myself, i can assure you that i never heard of such a legend. it sure made me laugh though... :))

largely forgettable monster film from the 50s features truly awful special effects -- the "claw" in question is a giant puppet that would make jim henson want to kill himself. i just saw the movie last thursday and i can't even tell you who was in it. that's a bad sign. i'm told that when the movie premiered audiences laughed it off the screen.... and that was in the 50s when standards in special effects were much lower. basically i should have walked out of the theater as soon as the words "produced by sam katzman" came on the screen if i knew what was good for me, but then i sat through "harum scarum" also so i guess i deserve it.

personally, i have no problem with the acting, nor the script. i do have a problem with the giant bird. it was simply awful. plain and simple.one's first impulse is the roll around laughing when one sees it. what were they thinking!? budget be damned. the monster bird was a monstrous joke.of course, in my opinion if the producers could obtain actors such as ankrum, corday and morrow, then they would have the special effect people come up with a much better beast. oh well. what is done is done. this will be the case of the eternal joke on them that was unintended.

this one's as cheesy as they come  the concept of a massive and indestructible extraterrestrial bird is already too loopy for words, but wait till you get a load of the goofy creature as it appears on screen! i tell you i laughed so hard through this thing that i missed out on some of the expository dialogue  then again, the latter is often so heavy on scientific jargon and laws of physics and such (at which i've never been any good, in spite of my love of sci-fi movies) that it didn't really matter anyway! the bird  first depicted as a mere blurred form whizzing through the skies but subsequently shown in all its dopey glory  is so sublimely silly that it wouldn't be amiss in a looney tunes cartoon (witness the series of intermittently-taken photographs that start with the creature in the distance and end on a side-splitting extreme close-up of its face)! director sears had fared much better with his other film about ufos, the fine earth vs. the flying saucers (1956)  with special effects provided by a master, ray harryhausen (speaking of which, i've just given away my copy of the latter in anticipation of acquiring columbia's recently-released se dvd); also, it seems to me that some of the footage illustrating the bird's rampage in new york here were lifted from the destruction of washington seen in that earlier sci-fi classic! again, the leads are played by genre regulars  namely jeff morrow (from this island earth [1955]) and mara corday (from tarantula [1955]); as with the afore-mentioned flying saucers, these titles are highly-regarded and beloved by fans  consequently, they are vastly superior to this lamentable addition to the alien/monster animal cycle prevalent during the sci-fi heyday and beyond (incidentally, other flying menaces were featured in the flying serpent [1946], which i haven't watched, and larry cohen's tongue-in-cheek updating of same in q: the winged serpent [1982]).unfortunately, the giant claw can't even rise to a decent climax  which is so rushed as to be "a wash-out", to quote a jet pilot from the film itself whose assault with rockets on the bird proves completely ineffective (that is, before morrow realizes that it's shielded by an invisible barrier and then has to figure out a way how to be able to penetrate it). ultimately, apart from the intractable (and frankly tedious) technical asides, one gets a feeling of "so bad, it's good" watching this: after all, it only lasts for 74 minutes  and, in any case, the bird is such an unforgettably daft creation as to put a huge smile on your face every time it turns up!

spreading panic from broadway to bombay, 1957's the giant claw boasts perhaps the ultimate flying monster in movie history. described by one terrified quebecois witness as "la carcagne  she's de devil in de storm with de face of de wolf and de body of de woman with wings, bigger than i can tell," it doesn't say much for canadian women since when we finally see it in focus it's a cross between an overgrown buzzard, a chickenhawk and gonzo the great. but this isn't just any old giant turkey  impervious to rockets, invisible to radar and with a taste for swallowing parachutists whole and pecking away at the united nations building, it's an extraterrestrial giant turkey from an anti-matter galaxy millions of miles from earth that's come here to build a nest: "no other explanation is possible." luckily for humanity jeff morrow, test pilot and "chief cook and bottle washer in a one-man birdwatching society," invents a weapon to disable its impenetrable shield so they can hit it with everything but the kitchen sink  but don't worry: morris ankrum's general assures him "we've got kitchen sinks to spare, son."  just in time for a last-minute clinch with co-star mara corday. some of the dialogue has dated rather unfortunately  "i admire your spunk, and you keep climbing on our backs whenever we've messed up"  and strangely enough it's nowhere near as much fun as a film with a giant flying turkey should be, but the beast itself is such a truly memorable creation for all the wrong reasons that it's hard to dislike even if you are liking it for all the wrong reasons. and full marks to the cast for delivering gem after gem of direlogue with a straight face: "honest to pete, i'll never call my mother-in-law an old crow again!," "the only trouble is that the last time i talked to a chaplain there wasn't any telephone line to the one and only place where we can get the kind of help we need" and the immortal "there it is now, attacking the united nations building!"

this is almost ed wood territory. yeah, that ridiculous wreck of a flying monster looks like a cross between a turkey buzzard and a bad day at the dentist's office. and that sound effect screech makes fingernails across a blackboard sound like mozart. and why the giant claw when the goofy critter gobbles its victims with a mechanical jaw. we get big close-ups of the ugly chicken foot, but nothing more. i guess the producers thought a more appropriately titled big mouth might suggest a jerry lewis comedy. and speaking of comedies, all that "anti-matter" gobbledy-gook is funnier than anything in a lewis movie. i guess the scripters were stuck for a reason why an ordinary duck hunter couldn't take care of a 1950's flying menace, so they concocted a real whopper-- anti-matter from another galaxy. yup, this fugitive from kfc is supposed to have flown in from another galaxy behind a shield of anti- matter as explained in excruciating detail by one of the film's resident geniuses. in this case, it's jeff morrow a pilot who i gather in his off-hours advises einstein on the secrets of the universe. unfortunately, it's also morrow who keeps the ridiculous proceedings out of the bad-movie hall of shame since he actually delivers his lines with a straight face. what's more, he even sounds as if he believes them. this is a movie acting triumph of the first order. to heck with the oscars, morrow deserves a combat medal for performing above and beyond the call of duty under the most extreme bad movie circumstances. watch leading lady corday, then you can gauge his fortitude under fire. she looks like she just woke up inside a bad dream and maybe if she stands stock-still, no one will notice her. i barely did. oh well, the first time i saw this drive-in disaster was through a beery haze in the back row of what's now a housing development. i should have learned my lesson and broken out another 12-pack this second time around.

pilot mitch macafee (jeff morrow) sees a ufo while test flying a plane--but nothing shows up on radar. then planes and ships start disappearing and reports of a ufo increase. it turns out it's a giant monster bird that is attacking and killing. but what is it and why is it here? this has all the right elements for a classic. it has an actually pretty entertaining script--i was never really bored. the acting is good (for a 1950s monster movie). morrow doesn't overdo the macho hero act and mara corday is quite good as the requisite female love interest. she's also strong and takes care of herself--even though she is off getting food and coffee for everyone all during the movie. the problem here is the monster. dear god--it's terrible! it looks like a deranged turkey! it has a long neck, a hilariously stupid beak, some teeth, a few strands of hair on its head and claws. and--oh yes--it squawks! not roaring--squawking! the actors had no idea what it looked like--it was added after production. actors morrow and corday were horrified when they finally saw it in a theatre. morrow said his audience burst out laughing and he left the theatre quickly before the movie ended! producer sam katzman was responsible for this. he wanted to save money and gave the world the stupidest monster ever. and you can see the wires moving it too! this gets 4 stars only because morrow and corday are so good and the script is well done. it gets no stars for the pathetic monster--wait till you see it attack what is obviously a toy train! worth a look if you're a horror fan to see what has to be the stupidest monster ever.

i love old "monster movies" for the pure camp value. this one does not disappoint if you find that sort of thing amusing.the acting is pure 1950s stilted crap. you do get used to it when you've seen enough of these... the dialogue is very silly and ultimately forgettable. you're just there for the giant bird.the "science" in this movie is hilarious. a monstrous otherworldly avian that can manipulate anti-matter... intent on wreaking havoc and eating people... an alien who has come to earth to nest. some of the best scenes in the movie (that don't have the bird in them) include the "scientists" explaining what is going on.a lot has been said about the ridiculous bird marionette. it looks like a new baby bird... bald and ugly with ruffled feathers. it even caws like a hungry, angry fledgling. however, the bird scared the crap out of my three year old, who had big scary bird nightmares for the evening. it's a bit creepy.i was very sad about the scene where they shoot the egg. (somehow the egg is not protected by an antimatter shield.) but i'm a bird lover, what can i say?

ok, this 'horror' film was meant to be a joke, right? please tell me it was supposed to be a joke, then i'll understand.a big cawing bird with giant claws - or one claw, anyway - swoops down on unsuspecting folks on the ground and gobbles them up. mara corday and jeff morrow sufficiently overact in order to keep things interesting, but at least you'll enjoy a hearty snicker when you see the 'monster'. it looks like a cross between a deranged chicken and mortimer snerd.either director fred sears just made this picture in a hurry and knew the bird looked utterly ridiculous, or he really thought his film and creature were genuinely frightening. i prefer to think - and hope - it was the former.p.s. the bird needs a haircut.

i haven't read the book of this and based on this adaptation, will not bother. i hated every character in this show - miranda was slutty, selfish and mumbled miserably through the appalling dialogue, her sister was a total wimp, and this was the worst depiction of manic-depression i have ever seen. i have a degree in psychology, and this was not accurate. in fact, until it was mentioned, i did not realise troy was supposed to be bipolar - i thought he was a normal, slightly grumpy teenager.the only saving grace in this stupid show was david tennant, whose brilliantly psychotic performance was the only thing that got me to watch the second half. clearly the writers and producers of this show have not done any research - troy's mental problems are not remotely accurate, nor are the forensics involved in the "twist" ending (and if you did not spot that a mile off, you are a big ole dummy!) utter garbage.

oh, yawn. not another chick flick where the men are all pigs and the women will get even for the abuse they suffered. the only difference is that, in this film, everybody's a pig or has mush for brains. i hated this film for the moral issue of why it's right to send a man to prison for life for a murder he didn't commit. is that a more immoral act than his abuse and deviousness. this movie shows all the situational ethics of bad writing. i saw it on the cbc's "best of britain" series. if this is britain's best, no wonder the british film industry is in trouble.the only bright spot in this film was david tennant, he plays his character as so despicable that i'm likely to spit on the next person who speaks with a scottish accent. kate ashfield tries to play the victim but comes off in the end as immorally devious as david tennant's character. they deserve each other.in the mush for brains category are the parents who see nothing wrong with the obviously psychotic brendan. english policemen are made out to be so incompetent that they're unfit to give out traffic tickets. the british policeman's union should sue the makers of this film for defamation.this film isn't worth the electricity it takes to run your dvd to watch it.

i find it disconcerting that in an era when satisfying and fulfilling spirituality is unknown and we are all scattered across the whole spectrum of possible beliefs, that a charlatan and fraud of gurdjieff's caliber (as a charlatan, he is exceptional; there is no denying he had a special gift. it's a pity he misused it, though, for the aggrandizement of his wounded ego, feeding on the adulation of unwary sheep who were at his beck and call and in awe of him) can inspire such extreme adherence and credulity. this movie presents an idealized version of gurdjieff's own largely fictional and fantastic account of his formation and "awakening" (which i would rather describe as his discovery of how much he could sway the minds and wills of certain types of sadly disoriented people). see it, if you dare to have a disagreeable eye-opening about how sadly deprived we are of true religious leaders, to the extent that a clown like gurdjieff could inspire such devotion - and be careful to have your blood pressure medicine at hand if you are one of those who still hope for a healthy religion to emerge from the ruins of christianity, as a supreme example of cinematography at the entire service of the premises and pretenses of a dysfunctional cult.

the title doesn't make much sense to me. i'm not sure what door in the movie shouldn't have been opened.the movie starts uneventfully, with a conversation between a man and a woman in a room that looks like a richly furnished train car, complete with the sound of the train traveling. in fact, the man's house is a train car, and he has a cassette of train sounds. the woman leaves, and calls a young woman. the young woman tells her boyfriend, a doctor, that she's been told her grandmother is ill, and she needs to return to her home town. she hasn't been there in thirteen years.flash back to thirteen years ago. a shadowy figure enters a house. he caresses a sleeping young girl, then goes into another room and stabs the girl's mother. the girl wakes up and enters her mother's room and finds her dead with a knife in her. she screams, and an arm comes out of nowhere and claps a hand over her mouth. she looks up in fear. that early scene in the movie of the killer muffling her scream, and the girl's look is one of the few effective shots in the movie.it doesn't have much going for it in the visuals department. occasionally there's some strange use of sound, and there's some weird lighting in an attic scene where many of the panes of glass are red and blue.back to the present day. the young woman arrives in her grandmother's house. an old doctor is there, who she doesn't trust, along with the man from the opening scene "judge" and kearn, the town's museum operator. she doesn't trust any of them, and it's true they don't inspire any trust. she's rather crabby throughout the whole movie. she wants to check her grandmother into a hospital. the men in the town want her house, and the museum operator wants the things in it (his museum is already filled with many of the grandmother's things). inexplicably, the woman wants to keep the house.the young woman starts getting phone calls from a man speaking in a sinister whisper. he makes various threats, and wants her to do things to arouse him. such scenes recur often. unfortunately, there are so few characters in the movie, that the possibilities of who it could be are limited. worse still, we see right from the beginning who is making the phone calls. so, while the young woman doesn't know (even though the caller occasionally drops into his normal voice), the audience always knows: no suspense. each call rattles her more and more.the ending was unexpected for me, so maybe gets points for not going with the obvious, but i'm not sure i cared for it.

it seems at least vaguely possible that this movie provided a bit of inspiration for "the sopranos," as its main character, martin blank (john cusack) is a hit man who has so many issues from his past and his profession that he's in therapy trying to deal with it all. everything finally comes to a head at his 10-year high school reunion. the problem was that by the time blank got to the reunion i had stopped caring. frankly, i found this movie a drag from start to finish.it had potential. there was a reasonably good cast, headed by cusack and dan aykroyd, playing grocer, his arch-rival in the hit-man business, along with minnie driver as debi, blank's high school sweetheart who he stood up on prom night, and a limited role for alan arkin as dr. oatman, blank's psychologist. that fairly talented cast never really seemed to come together, though. the drama lacked intensity and the comedy lacked real humour. what i thought had the most potential to be a comedic storyline was grocer's proposal for a hit man's union, but aside from becoming a bit of a running joke, the idea never really got developed. as for the romance, one wondered why debi would even think of letting this guy back into her life.there were a handful of chuckles, but nothing really caught me and held me and i spent most of the movie wondering whether this thing was ever going to start to click. it never did - not for me, at least. 2/10

this is one of those movies where the acting, set location, direction, and effects were so bad you need to rent a copy get 5 or 6 buddies, a keg of beer, sit down and watch it. to borrow from the late douglas adams, "watching this movie will be like having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon... wrapped around a large gold brick.".what is wrong? everything. british actors posing as americans, there have been many that can pull it off like bob hoskins but he isn't in this one. it wasn't even necessary to choose north america as a location why not say it took place in england or something? the director seemed to like taking shots of girls tits and asses more than actually coming up with some kind of character motivation. so at this point you drunken buddies will be saying, "all right! another t&a shot!". there isn't much dialog so feel free to skip off to the kitchen and make those sandwiches. what did i like about this movie? after my friends passed out, i managed to collect $185 off of them and told them they spent it at the strip bar after we finished watching the awful movie.

the trailers for this movie promised and this movie delivered exactly what was promised: good campy fun with lots of very good looking naked broads! if you were expecting a major hollywood movie with major stars, stellar budgets, and mpaa tamed money shots, you will be *very* disappointed.however, if you are a fan of the old "b" movies with unknown, but very good looking young stars that act amazingly well, given the material, some hokey, but surprisingly well done special effects, and very tight naked nubile bodies, this movie is almost heaven!

your ability to enjoy the ashes of time may depend on our expectations before stepping into the theater. even its most strident supporters seem to agree that audiences can be split right up the middle in their appreciation of this unique film.unlike most hk actioners, the battle scenes are curiously kept at a distance. when they do happen, they're rendered in a jerky style in which it's difficult to make out exactly what's occurring on screen. the dramatic scenes can be extravagantly beautiful, with the of maggie cheung, brigitte lin, and a roll-call of hk's top acting talent chewing up the scenery. as with some of wong kar-wai's early work, the dialog could be more precise. in short, the ashes of time requires a forgiving attitude. released around the same time as wong kar-wai's spectacularly successful chungking express, it's clear that the director isn't as confident working with the elements of the martial arts film. anyone looking for tense action is likely to be disappointed. but those intrigued by the director's aesthetic will likely find this a unique experience at the very least.

the direction by wong is perhaps the all time worst in film history i've ever seen. this film makes my all time worst film of 2000, dungeons and dragons by courtney soloman looked like an oscar winner. the flaws in this movie is beyond explanation. the biggest one is the lack of depth. every scene does not develop fully as if the editing room doesn't know how to do their job correctly. its a shame that with such an all-star cast of talents and a famous popular traditional story can be destroyed by this lack of vision.i am so disgusted and hope that some great director like john woo or ang lee, decide to remake this film and do some justice. i'm not even sure if i can rate 0/10??

disclaimer: during my ventures into foreign cinema, i have taken a liking to a wide variety of movies that span different genres that include horror, action, drama, comedy, and romance, to name a few. thus, i have enjoyed the thoughtful, serious tone of dramas as well as the mindless, popcorn fun of action films. with a wide array of chinese, japanese, and korean movies under my belt, i am confident in my ability to recognize bright spots in movies to appreciate and complement. unfortunately, ashes of time has nothing to recognize. it is one of the worst chinese movies i have ever seen.to start off, this overrated swordplay epic showcases the infamous "slideshow" action sequence throughout, which is nothing more than an ultra-cheap and pathetic form of action choreography. one simply needs to show a series of close-up pictures of grimising faces, swords, legs and/or arms, and then a dead body. bravissimo! you now have an action sequence for ashes of time. the problem lies not only in its poor quality but also in the fact that the scenes are so chaotic and disjointed that the viewer has no idea what the hell is going on.the dramatic element of this film is nonexistent, as it relies on the characters telling the viewer that they love someone or hate someone instead of actually developing and showing such elements on screen, which renders all characters generic and colorless, leaving the viewer completely indifferent to their actions. in fact, the storyline itself is an absolute disaster, introducing way too many characters way too quickly with way too many plot devices. plot complexities in films can be used very advantageously (i.e., a tale of two sisters), but ashes of time becomes exploitative trash when it does nothing more than convolute a very simple plot for no apparently good reason.in fact, this entire movie acts like a series of smokescreens to cover up its deficiencies. horrible action choreography is covered up by "slideshow" tricks and chaotic camera movements. non-existent character development is covered up by the characters overtly saying how they feel. and a thoughtless storyline is covered up by confusing the viewer with convolution.as if this weren't bad enough, this movie was extremely boring, seeming more like 150 minutes instead of the actual 95.rating = a rarely given 0/5 stars.

as i sit back after watching wong kar-wai's 1994 movie ashes of time  more specifically the 2008 re-edit and re-release with the word 'redux' slapped on the end of the title  i wonder what went wrong. i wonder why the film just didn't work out at all. i wonder why the movie failed to score any major points in my book. in particular, what was it about the film which dragged it down, and made it the director's worst film of his career?well it's not too hard to figure out really. let me just say that it truly is a shame that kar-wai so abruptly went down this hell-hole of mediocrity and poorness in moviedom, especially considering the fact that in the same year he released chungking express, one of his enduring legacies and an absolutely sublime film. so  what went wrong? it would be suitable to consider ashes of time as somewhat of an experimental film. our director essentially places his own inimitable style of film-making and places it in an entirely different setting, mood and atmosphere; what results is a catastrophic film which is all over the place and simply does not work out. hence, it would be even wiser to call ashes of time a failed experiment. bold, audacious and innovative, but a failure nonetheless.let me elaborate. those who have seen the films of mr. kar-wai, a hong kong-born film auteur who's made his mark on the art-house world since his debut in the late-80's, will know that there is an overriding aesthetic which binds all of his movies together; essentially and frankly speaking, they're all colourful, thought-provoking, amiable, subtly humorous and meaningful evocations of life, love and loss. the same formula is transposed into ashes of time; however, the regular setting of hong kong is ridden of, and in its stead we're placed into the setting of ancient china, and the land of the legendary martial arts warriors and clansmen.intertwined into this quasi-adventure/historical caper is the typical kar-wai love story, this time involving an elegiac hit-man who has moved to the middle of the desert, and is carrying out contract killings. however, i must stop myself there; description of characters is a useless thing to do. why? because not a single character in ashes of time is worth mentioning or nothing. what a bland cast, and what a waste of talent (the case of ashes of time contains nearly all regular kar-wai collaborators).not only that, but the film is essentially endless incessant rambling in a horrendous, almost non-existent narrative structure. one of the main reasons why detractors of ashes of time berate it is because it seems to possess no plot whatsoever, let alone a semblance or an indication of one. you can definitely see what they're getting at, even from the first two, three minutes, maybe less, of the film. perhaps it's just the atypical setting of ancient china which is unaccustomed and inappropriate for kar-wai's typical film-making style. i like to think, however unfortunate it may be, that mr. kar-wai just stuffed up big time here.one thing that a reviewer can actually compliment in ashes of time, albeit said compliment being starkly isolated, is another director trademark  wonderful, colourful and blissful aesthetics. what joyous colour is composed on-screen, what glorious textures are painted for us, and what breathtaking landscapes and imagery are captured for us throughout the entire movie. we can at least take this as a sign that wong kar-wai is still there at heart, and it's just the film which is so atypical, and buries his usually commendable nuance. although the visuals aren't enough for us to fully absolve kar-wai for this disastrous venture, they're enough to make the film worthwhile  and at least we don't walk out of the movie in a completely and totally cantankerous mood, now that there's something we can think of nicely.the film is essentially a 'wuxia art' film, following in the style of, say, legendary japanese filmmaker akira kurosawa. however, one thing differentiates kar-wai's film from kurosawa's best, and that's that in the japanese director's films everything gels together and simply works. in ashes of time, nothing seems to work. kar-wai's attempt to make a genuinely profound wuxia film, let alone an intellectual and provocative movie in general terms, is a futile endeavour.kar-wai claims that making ashes of time exhausted him, and that he needed time to clear his head. it must've certainly been a fatiguing effort on his behalf, as his exertions are embodied in the film and transferred to us directly  i mean, just watching the film is an exhausting effort, and now i need time to clear my head of this unpleasant movie-going experience.

"ashes of time" was an audacious project but ended up being a pretentious movie. this film is a good example of how to tell a simple story in a complex manner. the plot of "ashes of time" is fairly simple and comes down to two words: "love triangle". because of those "love triangles" crossing stories, jealousy, hate and love are the main dynamics displayed by the characters. the narrative part is seen through ou-yang feng's eyes (leslie cheung). ou-yang feng lives in the desert, where he acts as middleman to various swordsmen and becomes the tool of destiny through which vengeance is achieved. unfortunately "ashes of time" fails in telling these simple stories of love and hate. wong kar-wai lost himself driven by a desire to make each frame of the film a painting and an aesthetic experience. in fact beside the casting of beautiful actors (men and women) everything else is a failure in this movie. dialogs are minimalists and not original at all. picture's quality is very much unequal, the editing is one of the worst ever seen (at least by me) in the "swordplay" genre and finally the filming of the rare sword fight is very confusing and unappealing. even the attempt of building artistic scenes is not always achieved: the so call erotic "women on a horse" scene is ridiculous, not erotic and useless. wong kar-wai wanted to deliver 100 minutes of pure aesthetic experience and forgot that a film is first about how a plot is told. by forgetting that he delivers an awkward movie that doesn't even fulfill its artistic objective.

recap: a lone swordsman, living in the desert and acting as an agent to other swordsmen, recollects how his life turned out to be as it is. it started with that the woman he loved chose to marry his brother instead, causing him to leave his home town. one of the swordsmen is huang who is himself in the middle of a complicated love story, where a woman wants to have him killed for having ran away from a promise to marry her younger sister. but the sister wants to hire a swordsman to have huang protected, and everything is put to an edge when the woman and her sister is really the same person.comments: i've seen the redux version released in 2008 of the original that was released in 1994. how the two versions differ i can't say, but the redux is very heavily stylized in the way of chinese wuxia action. that is unfortunate as that style to me seems to have forgotten one of the most important elements of a successful and entertaining movie. a comprehensible story. but true to its style scenery and visual elements seem much more important and much more in focus of writer and director kar wai wong. therefore there are lots of colorful, very beautiful scenes, that are completely unrelated to the story.the editing and timeline of the story is also mishandled. much is left out in the scenes, the time line is broken and rearranged in a confusing way. very slow and calm scenes are suddenly relieved by surprisingly brutal and seemingly unmotivated fights, only to themselves being relieved by something else and unrelated. the result is a confusing and very uninteresting movie.thanks to these brutal but very few fights, the movie is put into the action genre. the poster and photographs also imply this but could almost be regarded as false marketing. only a few minutes out of the 90 could be considered as anything like action, the other couldn't be farther away from it. the movie in its entirety is very slow, dull and hence very boring. not even the rare action filled scenes help since they are so disconnected from the rest of the movie.i might say that i'm not a fan of this chinese style, since they often seem to be afflicted of these same problems, most importantly that the visual is more important than the story, but ashes of time redux is perhaps the worst example i've seen.3/10

no that its sick. it's not sick. it made me want to puke because i spent 2 dollars on it. its boring, retarded, and annoying. i didn't see the mst3k version, which sucks because i bet the mst3k version was funny. it's sad that people waste money on these kinds of movies. i'm surprised its not on the "100 worst movies of all time list".tromadude's rating- 0 outta ***** stars

ah, another movie with motorcycles, hell's angels posse and steve a-lame-o as the not-so-cool car driver. this movie does not rely on story but lots of drinking, pot smoking, and lots of moronic acts. steve's rendition of a dying cat during his "i love what i know" serenade had me vomiting for hours. bike chick linda (rrrr) makes out with everyone! fats did the best acting since he just grunts and makes sounds. i also dare you to try to make out what banjo is saying. "you messin' wit private stock." this is scriptwriting folks.i liked the ending. what better place to have the climax than a lighthouse! you have to see this to detest it.die jeter, die!!!

not really all that much to this movie...either a stunt racer or a stock car racer has a flaming car in the beginning of the movie, goes to bar, is approached by a biker gang who ruins his chances with a very lovely lady, offer him a job, he goes back to their place, refuses, the police ask him to accept their ya go!!! what plays out is a very annoying little film that sees the hero not really do all that much and a biker gang that can kill and for some reason the police can not pin a crime on them. i am not sure why the female biker did what she did at the end, but hey it is a bad movie, you always get scenes that make little sense. i am still trying to figure out if i misheard it when they said the hero of the piece was a stunt car driver. they may have said stock car driver because why would a stunt racer be racing and i wouldn't think it would be all that uncommon for a stunt car to crash. the actors are bad, and all the bikers are pretty annoying and the hero is kind of incompetent...really this movie is not full of kicks but it is the pits.

this movie begins with a man who appears to be some sort of sports driver. he meets up with a gang which contains an arrogant boss, an obvious idiot, a fat boy who never speaks, and a woman who rotates between the three of them. the group which is called satan's angels, wants rod, the driver, as their personal driver. he says no but then says yes after the authorities make him a spy to check on them. they rob a weapon shop in a ridiculously plot-missing scene. the scene involves the woman walking into the store with her long hair in a bun and large circular glasses on. she says she wants protection and wants the shopkeeper to load the gun to show her how. she then takes it from the shopkeeper and shoots him. the other three in the gang (excluding rod) run into the store. they take everything off the walls and then proceed to play with it like children receiving their toys on christmas day.this movie surely wastes no precious screen time with a plot.

this latter-day fulci schlocker is a totally abysmal concoction dealing with an incurable gambler (brett halsey) who decides bluebeard-style to pay off his ever-rising debts by seducing some of the ugliest bitches you will ever lay your eyes on and who just happen to be wealthy widows! the fulci-penned script also contrives to incorporate a few blackly comedic elements - which only result in some unfunny business involving a corpse which won't stay put, an opera singer victim who won't stop singing, etc. - not to mention a doppelganger theme straight out of the student of prague - although, in this case, the two personas communicate via pre-recorded radio messages!! in the end, i can't say i'm surprised that this film shows no sign of the sophistication of mario bava's hatchet for the honeymoon (1970) which it resembles in several ways and that it is content to merely pile up the disgustingly gory (but none-too-convincing) effects of dismembered limbs and squashed or melting faces with which, alas, fulci had by then become completely associated.

this is just dreadful. i regret every second of the 80 minutes i spent watching this dreck. i think it's supposed to be a comedy, but i don't remember laughing much, except at a few blatant inconsistencies and downright glaring errors.an unattractive middle-aged man called lester meets up with rich unattractive middle-aged women via lonely hearts ads, and then murders them for the money he needs to feed his gambling addiction. that's the whole plot, and that's really all that happens. along the way there is an attempt at intrigue when lester starts to get phone calls from a mysterious stranger who taunts him about knowing his secret, but its so badly implemented, you may not realise what is actually supposed to be happening. the sequences in which lester murders the rich widows are all quite brutal but also seemingly dressed up as comedies. one sequence has a woman bludgeoned with a wooden pole and then shoved into an oven. it's very cruelly depicted, but it is played out against blaring big-band waltz music, with lester pulling faces and adopting comedy poses throughout. another scene has the victim murdered while she constantly sings shrill opera songs...you have to see this to believe it! actually - you don't have to see it at all, in fact i strongly recommend you avoid this flop. fulci does not seem to know which hat he is wearing and there's no evidence of any of the flair seen in his earlier career. one sequence stood out to me as particularly wretched: the revelation when lester suddenly realises that he has no shadow. fulci seems unable to think up any visual representation of this phenomena on screen, so from this point on he just films the actor as normal, shadow and all!! and thus totally blows the whole angle. either he had zero budget for effects, or he just didn't care enough to think up any way of showing it. whatever it was, that should give you a taste of how lame this whole project is. i couldn't even understand most of the film, and there certainly wasn't anything on screen worth looking at half the time. even the ending was as flat as a pancake. a real dud.

hailing from 1988, touch of death is probably the most frustrating fulci film i've seen to date, prompting me to join the chorus of horror fans who generalise that his films get worse as you get later into his career. considering the plot synopsis, i was expecting some bloody bad-natured fun with this one, but for all its bizarre flourishes, it feels tedious even at a running time of just 80 minutes, and suffers from nauseatingly shabby production values and film-making craft (or lack thereof).el story: a gambling addict widower wines and dines rich (and strange) women he finds via lonely hearts columns before offing them in gruesome fashion - sometimes eating them or feeding them to animals - and stealing their money to keep his debtors at bay. sure, it's unlikely that just one man would be the host for so much screwed-up pathology all at once (addict, psycho/sociopath, cannibal), but this is fulci!touch is actually the cheapest and sparsest looking fulci film i've seen. there's almost nobody in it, even in the background of shots out on the street, for instance. a newsreader who keeps appearing on the film's televisions to warn the non-existent cast about the maniac's latest doings operates out of the most pathetic tv studio on the planet. he never even gets to look at the camera because has to read all the headlines off misaligned sheets of paper.some scenes just go on and on with the protagonist muttering to himself about what he's done or what he's about to do, but the acting is nowhere near good enough to sustain this kind of thing, so the main outcome is viewer boredom. the film also looks bland and ugly in general. i've read that it was intended to be an italian telemovie (did it ever screen in that venue? with the amount of gore involved, it seems unlikely), and it does reek of crappy old telemovie production values.this is also fulci's first foray into outright black humour, but he's just too graceless a director to make it work. sometimes conspicuously cheerful or 'wacky' music is used to play against a gruesome scene, for instance while the hero/villain is carving up a dead body in his basement. the effect isn't really chilling or funny or ironic anything that you'd like it to be - it's mostly just hamfisted and crappy.there are of course some redeeming moments of gore (that you'll be waiting for while trying to stay awake), including the eventual murder by oven(!) of a woman who just won't quit life, even after her face has been totally bashed apart with a bloody great club, and a homeless guy who gets a car run back and forth over him about five times. the most outrageous element of touch, however, is all the physical deformation on the widows courted by the crazy guy. beards, hairy moles, messy harelips - it's not like he sought out women with these features, it's just the way all lonely hearts widows are, apparently. there are plenty of shots of mr crazy secretly grimacing while he's smooching up these women. the black humour of such garish misogyny might have some staying power or resonance if the film wasn't so poorly executed in general. in the end, touch of death just seems like a really lazy, inarticulate mess.

yeah, what did i expect? i thought this would be a film about young adults at their turning-point in life, something like "sonnenallee" or "american pie", which i liked a lot. i wanted to see a funny film, perhaps with an ironic look on idyllic wuerzburg. and what did i get?attention, spoilers ahead!this film starts with a lengthy dialogue which gives you a good hint of what will inevitably follow: more lengthy dialogues. sometimes i thought moritz bleibtreu might have forgotten his text and trying to hide that fact by improvising and just repeating what he was saying before. but as i think of bleibtreu as one of the better german actors, i believe that this effect really was intended. i think the author wanted to show how boring talking to close friends can be - especially when they are stoned. but really, i don't need cinema to be bored by stoned friends' talk. boring dialogues make up most of this film.but okay, that's one thing. i can cope with that, i have seen nice films with abominable dialogues, just think of schwarzenegger's life's work. but the next thing is that characters are cheap and flat and that the storyline is as foreseeable as anything. just one example (spoiler!!): why, do you think, does someone take a garden hose to his hemp-plants deep in the forest? to water them? of course not, usually you don't find water-pipes deep in forests, do you? the only reason this water-hose is there is that a hunter who happens to come by while the two protagonists are harvesting their dope can be drugged, maltreated and finally filled up with three bottles of jaegermeister. i truly hated this scene, because it's really violent. usually, i don't mind violence in films - slapstick-comedies are full of it. but in that sort of comedy there is a silent agreement between the film and you that people don't get hurt if they fall on their faces or get beaten with chairs or things like that. but if that happens in a film which is otherwise realistic enough, slapstick-scenes also seem real. in this particular scene in "lammbock" i really thought that this hunter must be badly injured, if not dead - the final scene really invoked in me the impression that he is left to die there, totally filled up with more booze anyone could handle. and the protagonists just walk away. it would have been otherwise if the author had consistently followed one style; the scene could have been quite funny.talking about being consistently - that's what i missed most about this film. the whole film seems to be a listing of small episodes that came to the author's mind. things just happen without a apparent reason - yeah, i know, that's life, but that's not cinema, because cinema is meant to tell a story, not to show boring episodes without any significance. i found myself asking "where's the point?" all the time. characters besides the two main ones are not elaborated, you never get to know why the protagonist's sister wants to sleep with his best friend kai, in fact, she tells you but i could not buy it, not at all. i think she just was there to give kai an opportunity to act this childish aids-test sketch, which you sure have seen a thousand times before, and mostly better. the protagonist's girlfriend you meet once, then she leaves germany (what you don't even see and the guy doesn't seem to care) and finally it is mentioned in one sentence that she has met someone else in america and splits up with the protagonist. it seemed to me that the author wanted to tie up a few loose ends. he actually didn't, you never really get to know what's so bad about studying law, being daddy's son (daddy fixes everything in the end and serves coffee in the middle of the night, which to my mind made him one of the nicer characters in the whole film) and living in beautiful wuerzburg. even the dinner with daddy's layer-friend, which maybe was intended to show how horrible it is to have to live up to dad's expectations, seemed flat, just another nice dinner with the family's friends (except for the trip the guy is on later, but i think showing that eating dope before you dine with parents isn't healthy was not the point of this scene, if there was any). i have experienced far worse dinners in my life than this one and still finished my exams. i couldn't understand one single character in the whole film, they just seemed flat and implausible.all this made it a not-so-good film, but not one i wouldn't watch again on television. it really had a few good scenes (most of them were not new, though, like the one with the nice and understanding policemen), some were really funny, some dialogues were nice and i like bleibtreu's play, although he repeated his well-known stereotypes again this time. not good, not abominable, that's what i thought after the film was half over.but then came this incest scene and this i really found repulsive. incest simply isn't funny. i don't even know if this was intended to be funny, some people in the audience laughed, so it could have been meant this way. this scene spoiled the whole film for me, i couldn't feel sympathy for the protagonist any more - i can't feel sympathy for anyone who f**** a helpless person, to me, this is rape and rape isn't funny. so it might have been a hint of drama or so, but the incest is never again mentioned (although we thought this could have been one reason for the protagonist to leave germany in the end, but as it is never mentioned again, we don't know.), it is even totally unnecessary. i almost expected the sister to become pregnant in the end, which would just have added the finishing touch to this tasteless story, but not even this final cliche is fulfilled, just as nothing is really solved or thought through to the end in this film. it isn't really funny, it isn't really a drama, it isn't at all a road movie a la tarantino despite desperate tries on violence, it is definitely not enjoyable.skip this film. watch "final fantasy", that's also bad, but at least with beautiful pictures and not that tasteless.

countenance! antoine monot, in a copycat impersonation of kevin smith's silent bob, keeps asking for it, but writer/director christian zübert never listens. zübert just can't say no to a joke, no matter how cheap. the best thing about this movie is its soundtrack. of course, joey burns of calexico and the divine jonathan richman, understated old-school bard of "there's something about mary" fame, would grace any small-town dropout story. in visual allure, stefan (lukas gregorowicz) looks cool enough riding his tan six-series bmw two-door, wearing aviator shades, going nowhere. true, he *accidentally* sleeps with his wild-eyed bohemian kid sister (marie zielcke), but then, who wouldn't? thumbs up also to how he goes black-and-white on a liberal dose of that mysterious substance they call zero-zero, but if you're looking for a slightly more serious rendering of what intoxication can do to you, i suggest you check out "fear and loathing in las vegas".

i'm a huge zack allan fan and was disappointed that he only got one scene in the movie. this was also my favourite scene where he confiscates a character's weapons and directs her to down below. unfortunately unlike thirdspace & river of souls, most of the action took place off station. i didn't care much for garibaldi after the first three seasons and think sheridan is okay but no sinclair. i like lochley but she only had limited screen time. if you like crusade or space battles you should enjoy it. personally i can only give it 1/10.

a remake can be successful. an adaptation can be successful. it isn't relevant whether its a remake or an adaptation.a good movie is a good movie and a poor movie is a poor movie, regardless.sarkar, i am afraid, was a very poor movie. first of all, just by making characters look dangerous, or macho, they don't bring in an aura about them.what was so brilliant about nagre(amitabh bacchan's character) that we should have been in aura of his 'power' and what showed the 'benevolence' of the character? nothing.this fact was said by a commentator and amitabh kept giving facial expressions. now amitabh can give brilliant facial expressions but why should it mean any thing if there is no history or story to go with it.there wasn't proper charecterisation of the characters who worked under 'sarkar' too. just because a man had spectacles, why should we assume he is wise. ] the flow of the movie was generally dullbecause scenes from the godfather were created (like the policeman slapping abhishek bacchan), the older brother being killed by abhishek (like fredo was killed on instructions of pacino) but too much was sought to be packed into the movie with too little story and depth to go with it. that was indeed the problem.if you try to pack 3 hours of intricate detail like a godfather in 2 hours and that too with few dialogues, what you get is a highlights show from a cricket match, never making the full impact watching a full match will make.

what on earth happened to rgv? there are so many things wrong about this movie that one needs to stop and decide where to start- first and worst - the music. every scene was accompanied with this pretentious background music that was telling you the mood, quite pathetically, i might add. secondly, the lighting - do we really need such dark scenes where we are wondering if the projector is still working? and finally - if you are going to indianise the godfather and godfather 2 - please realize that a lot of us have seen in. nayakan was a ripoff of gf1 but better done, and more entertaining. i have seen a similarity in both company and sarkar and while rgv's ab tak 56 was brilliant, these two movies leave something to be desired. people will not be impressed any more by just corrupt politicians and the lot. maybe rgv should see maqbool, which is good enough to be rgv!!

at the beginning of the movie, ramgopal verma says that "sarkar" is his tribute to the godfather. this one feels more like an insult. it pales terribly in comparison to the coppola classic. although no one was expecting ramgopal verma to fill coppola's shoes, the movie did create a lot of expectation and buzz. amitabh bachchan plays "sarkar", a character automatically drawing instant comparisons to indian political party shiv sena's supremo bal thackeray. abhishek bachchan plays his son shankar who returns from abroad and gets caught up in sarkar's politics at home. just like al pacino in the original godfather. as most bollywood fare, incidents and characters are overtly simplistic and devoid of any kind of solid foundation. quick phone calls and sudden announcements turn the film from one direction to another. abishek takes to mumbai's murky underworld politics-crime nexus like a duck takes to water. amithab bachchan as sarkar is supposed to look magnificent and powerful, he just ends up looking old and clueless. most of his acting is centered around constantly staring at different things around the movie set - the actor in front of him, the floor or in some other random direction. however, kay kay performs exceedingly well as the wronged elder son vishnu. so does zakir hussain as rashid, the dubai based dope smuggler who wants to gets his footing in mumbai. this actor has awesome screen presence and can send chills down your spine with just the way he looks. the moment he enters the screen, you want to run and hide under the bed. all its obvious flaws not withstanding, the film did well at the box office. the buzz and the big star cast obviously helping. also verma manages to hold your interest albeit mildly towards the later half of the film. he is actually making a sequel to this one which i am sure will be more of the same fare.

dear mr ram gopal varma, i don't know in which capacity i am writing this letter to you. i am a never-say-he's-finished amitabh bachchan fan, having sat through his cock-chasing act in jaadugar. i also demand some important designation in the godfather fan club, having watched the coppola classic more times than you have delivered flops from your factory. and, of course, i have been a big admirer of yours, right from the time you had nagarjuna wrapping the cycle chain around his knuckles in shiva.when you announced sarkar and called it your take on godfather, all one wanted to know was the date the first look would be out, the sunday the promos would go on air, the friday the film would be released. it was sheer wish fulfillment at work knowing that you, and not someone hovering between the mustard fields of amritsar and the tulip gardens of amsterdam, had taken up the task of recreating the puzo pages on the bollywood big screen.your cast couldn't have been more you  working for the first time with the legend, casting abhishek as his screen-son, giving kay kay a role he has deserved for years, bringing back forgotten faces like supriya pathak and rukhsar, and picking complete non-actors like katrina and tanishaa to join the list before july 1, you had made sarkar the most-awaited film ever for any godfather freak who worshiped bachchan.the opening credits stoked the hope that your stunning sepia-tinted promos on the telly had kindled. but now, you labeled sarkar your tribute to godfather instead of the word "inspired" which you had been using all along. probably you don't want the two creations to be compared but when the medium is the same, then a kaante would be compared to reservoir dogs and a reservoir dogs to a city on fire.also, when your first and last sequences  the heart of any screenplay treatment  are all about the establishment and the transfer of power, you can't keep the nagares and the corleones apart, even if you replace the american mafia moves with maharashtrian political power play.but you got it wrong, mr varma you wanted to show amitabh in his 70s avatar, as rustled up by the pens of salim-javed. you wanted him to lurk around larger than life. you wanted him to be his own brand(o). then how could you steal his voice in the name of using silence? how could you keep him rooted to his chair in the hunt for interesting camera angles? how could you leave him stranded without his voice and stature, the two things that have made his b so big? coppola's godfather cameraman gordon willis masked brando's eyes throughout the movie because it didn't have the power to match that drawling husky voice or that sudden snap of the fingers. but you tried to repeat the malik act from your very own company. but bachchan is no ajay devgan  his forte doesn't lie in the stagnant stare and the suffocating silence. you made the man look like a comatose patient, who's reminded from time to time to look at the cue cards and mouth those predictable one-liners. for that, agneepath's there, any given saturday.which bachchan fan would go and watch kay kay menon stealing the thunder from under his nose in the scene where sarkar asks vishnu to leave his house? which amitabh aficionado would go and watch him focus on achaar and carom, in a film that talks about power with a capital p in the promos? we can't handle so much in the name of restraint and understatement! you don't even allow the camera to rest on him for five seconds when he learns that his son wanted to kill him. give me the old-school camera-only-on-bachchan style, any given saturday.kudos to you, of course, for making an actor out of abhishek, first in naach and now in sarkar. you also allow him to show mallika sherawat that he can run as well as his father. even in the short prison sequence, you really make the bachchans come out of the text, an opportunity shaad missed in bunty aur babli. wish the film could have been more a father-son story rather than a chaotic conflict between caricatures in the name of characters, who pop up like the ad windows on the internet.you also let the women more into the script than puzo and coppola did and again, you deserve all the brownie points for squeezing them in so effectively. pathak is a welcome return as the mother in the middle, tanishaa lovable as the lovelorn girl, katrina a revelation as abhishek's confused lover and rukhsar's silence speaks volumes.but sub-plots do not a classic remake. when your free-flowing camera tries to make every frame look hatke and your loud background score irritates incessantly, we keep getting reminded that we are in a factory. well, maybe not a nino rota score but sarkar certainly deserved better than those govinda, govinda chants and uncalled-for flute interludes.mr varma, some of your factory directors tell me that you are involved with every project, from overseeing the shooting schedules to supervising the editing sessions. perhaps, in the middle of all the various storyboards, the bhiku matre scream is being muted by the subhash nagare silence. perhaps, you need to bring the shutters down on the factory and work on a single homemade product. otherwise, your products would remain products, to use and throw, not treasure. and movie buffs like me, for whom there are no hits and flops, only good cinema, would rather choose a film without factory finish, any given saturday.

it is disappointing to see as talented an actor as amitabh bachchan in such a weak role, especially when he was beyond sensational in black (which i highly recommend). one line in the film states: "sakar is not a mere man, he is a thought and a philosophy." director ram gopal varma credits the godfather as an inspiration for this movie, and perhaps that is the problem. it seems like a badly mangled american movie set in india. the left elbow index considers seven elements of film-making--acting, continuity, plot, character development, dialogue, artistry, and production sets--on a scale from a high of 10 to a low of 1, with 5 given as a average score. the film continuity seems high, an 8, by maintaining a violent tone infused with drama in places, and using justice outside the legal system as motivation. however, there seems to be a lack of emotion connected with the evil of organized crime. the acting rates a 4, it appears too weak, even when someone is being beaten or murdered, it seems hoohum. for example, when one character is shot in the forehead, i found myself wondering if, or when, he was going to fall. he does not, and ala ronald reagan he is placed in an automobile, with his bleeding face cradled ala john f. kennedy. the plot rates a 5 as an example of american-style gangsterism, with a family oriented robinhood at its head. character development appears static, and the characters seem like chess pieces on an abandoned chess board, thereby earning a rank of 3. the dialogue seems stilted, and appears to be forced to fit some bowery pattern of speech--a 4 for dialogue. production sets look to be below average--a 4. and, artistry is puzzling, with far too many close-ups, too rapid panning, and too many group scenes where the actors seem over rehearsed--a 3. to me, too much camera movement is disruptive. the average of the left elbow index is 4.4, and with a slight deduction based on poor derivatism it moves down to a 4. two questions continually arise in the film: one, why are so many people eating so often: and, two, does not india have its own brand of organized crime? do films like this have to be so dependent on western cultural examples? as much as i like amitabh bachchan, i cannot recommend this film.

i was expecting a lot from mr.amitabh bachan's role of sarkar, but am disappointed. being a ram gopal verma's direction i was not ready for this kind of a movie. sarkar is supposed to be a strong character, but the movie shows that amitabh is too dependent on others power rather than his. there is a movie in tamil called nayakan based on the theme of god father and kamala hassan has played the lead. the movie is well directed and the power till the end remains in the hands of kamala hassan, not his son. amitabh bachan seems to be too helpless in the movie and he just accepts everything instead of changing things. the movie fails to show the strong impact of god father.

yet another version of mother of all gangster flicks-the classic "godfather" and yet another case of over-hype due to media circus. sarkar, the 13th hindi film of ram gopal varma as director is also the weakest in his underworld trilogy including the other two being the excellent-satya and company. the charisma, the magnetic persona of the two bachchans playing father-son duo on screen for the first time is definitely a treat to watch out for. not just strong performances but their perfect chemistry is the biggest scoring point here for which varma should be applauded. however, the same equation of the duo is missing with the other characters in the film. reason-the other characters look more like cardboard caricatures esp. the villains represent the typical bollywood baddies. a character who attracts attention is elder son played by kaykay but again not able to hold due to half-baked characterization. . the drama and conflict is brought alive by the excessive use of close-shots, which brought a claustrophobic effect rightly needed to construct an ambiance. the haunting score (amar mohile) and the sound design (kunal mehta, parikshit lalwani & anup dev), together with dark, murky background overlapped by shinning powerful images (camerawork by amit roy) contributes to visuals so typical of ramu's style. but there is an overuse of music though fortunately no songs are there in the film. but can interest of today's "intelligently growing" audience be sustained just on shoulders of two performers and strong visuals ? i don't think so. surely, audience "maangey more" and here film fails to deliver. in any adaptation, in order to add a new dimension, the biggest pre-requisite is the screenplay, which is sluggish here not being crisp at places, and therefore the pace slackens quite often. what finally audience is subjected to is a highly predictable, very commonplace drama with very little surprise elements. top stunt director allan amin ghani is also not in his best form. some scenes which require a different treatment includes- a minister is talking foul about sarkar and the son is overhearing; a very amateurish shoot out in the jail on sarkar, sarkar jr. escapes from the clutches of his enemies, a son easily motivated to kill his own father, a son is secretly entering his father's room to kill him, a police commissioner slapping sarkar jr-all this requires a more realistic, hard-hitting approach which is the back-bone to create the required conflict. the dialogues are weak for eg. look at an amateurish line where a cm says to sarkar jr. "wo jo police commissioner tha na usay maine hata diya".. the women folk take on sarkar's working is completely ignored. the uninterrupted negotiations about criminal activities while sarkar is with his family also look slightly out of place in fact, the film follows a graph quite similar to ramu's own production-ab tak chhappan. in depicting the battle between good and evil, the other side of life-the law, police, administration, politics is completely ignored. certainly, more is expected in content. here the film definitely falls short and could not rise above an average fare. dear ramu, agreed that now you are laughing your way to the bank, you definitely need to take some drastic overhauling measures in your film production factory, before it is too late.

this movie was obviously made with a very low budget, but did they have to make it so obvious? it looked like they made no effort to make the "future" look in the least futuristic. for example, the first scene takes place in an 80's office building and all the cars that get blown up are from the late 70's (i assume they didn't want to blow up cars that cost more than $500). additionally, its pretty obvious that don "the dragon" is driving his personal car during the movie (after all, he did partially fund the film). finally, they point out at the beginning of the film that all kinds of drugs are now legal in this new "cyberpunk" society. not only does this never become important in the film, but later when don needs surgery without anesthesia, why doesn't he just go out and get some legal heroin or morphine? the whole movie is sloppy like this and completely anticlimactic since don easily blows up an "unstoppable" cybertracker about 25 minutes into the movie. however, if you find this movie cheap or free i'd watch it, the last scene is almost worth putting up with this whole film.

cybertracker is set in los angeles sometime in the near future where bodyguard eric phillips (co-producer don 'the dragon' wilson) saves senator robert dilly (john aprea) from an assassination attempt by a group known as the uhr, the union of human rights, who are angry at dilly for spearheading the computerised judicial system in which robots called cybertrackers are sent out to determine & dispense justice on the guilty. anyway, eric saves dilly who is very impressed & decides to see if he can trust eric in his shady activities like the cold blooded murder of a traitor, being the fine upstanding guy that he is eric isn't impressed when dilly kills a woman & he is asked to keep it quiet. eric escapes & sets out to bring dilly down, however dilly has lots of powerful friends & he uses his influence to frame eric & have his cybertrackers sent out in pursuit of him...co-produced & directed by richard pepin i think films like cybertracker give films a bad name, i didn't like it that much at all. the script by jacobsen hart is pretty predictable, it doesn't excite, it steals most of it's ideas & theme from other better sci-fi films & the heady mix of martial arts action & sci-fi don't gel that well. there a few fights, some car chases & a couple of shoot outs but it's all rather bland & forgettable. the film lacks imagination considering the film is set in the future & it deals with robots, technology & the way society is run & it's judicial system in particular. speaking of which the fantastic robocop (1987) mixed it's violent action & clever social commentary brilliantly but cybertracker doesn't even try to make any relevant social statement or try to portray any meaningful moral message about law enforcement, the script basically uses the concept to have robots & shoot outs which robocop did as well but also managed to include a good story. there is very little in cybertracker that i can say was entertaining & that's what films are about right?director pepin does ok but nothing stands out, it's all rather forgettable & it's not particularly exciting. the sci-fi elements are nothing more than the robot side of things & as a whole the film doesn't look that futuristic. the action scenes are alright, there's some exploding cars & some shoot outs but nothing spectacular.technically cybertracker is average, for a film supposedly set in the future it already looks dated & the special effects are poor. the acting was bad, i wonder if don 'the dragon' wilson signs cheques with that name?cybertracker was a waste of my time, there is nothing here original or exciting & the action is instantly forgettable. poor & that's all that needs to be said, not recommended.

eric phillips (don wilson) is a secret service agent who prevents the assassination of a senator however along the way he finds a conspiracy and has a tracker on his tail. the tracker by the way is bent on terminating phillips. the most obvious inspiration for this low budget cheeseball action flick, is of course robocop and while that film had some imagination and real energy, this just has a real life kickboxing champ running away from a robot. the movie isn't so awful as it is just empty and repetitive. the story is written in clichés and the characters are set up to be cut down by the various gunfire. don wilson, as usual, is terrible in the lead role.*1/2 out of 4-(poor)

the first 1/3 of this movie i loved and thought it was going to be one of truffaut's best films. i loved the plot where a pen pal marries a man from half way around the world--sight unseen. especially when this woman turns out to be a fraud and was responsible for the death of the real pen pal so she could take her place! she then cleaned out the husband's huge bank account and disappeared! i was really hooked and wanted to see more,...and then, the movie fell apart and became just plain dumb! despite her coming from new caladonia (an island in the pacific) and he from reunion (an island in the indian ocean), when he goes on a trip to the south of france, he stumbles upon her almost immediately. hmm,....odds are 187,000,000 to 1 but he finds her. then, instead of either killing her or turning her over to the police, he forgives her--even when she acknowledges what she has done. okay--this is tough to believe, but okay,...but then he helps to hide her from a private detective by murdering him!!!! no one is that stupid! yes, the character catherine deneuve plays is quite beautiful but come on folks--this is just silly. plus, if he only wanted her as a sex object, then why would he do this for a woman who is often frigid and completely selfish and evil.this movie, due to it's very ridiculous plot, does not deserve such high ratings! unless you are a die-hard truffaut fan, try another film--even one of truffaut's--just not this one.

i'm trying to find something of value here. the best i can muster is that truffaut wanted to make a movie as tedious, painful, puerile, annoying, illogical, and brainless as the experience of being in love. if that was his goal, then he succeeded, but the solution to his exercise is really a drag to watch.there is one scene that screams for a spoof: belmondo compares the features of deneuve's face to the features in a landscape . all i could think the whole time was "glacier," "ice floe," "two lonely fishermen wearing army surplus on a frozen lake in minnesota."the only other point of interest was the resurrection of buffoon's theory of climatic determinism. the tropics are presented as paradise, and things get progressively worse as they get colder, hell being calvinist french switzerland. that was kind of funny.

...if you've been laughing too much for a long time, and need to take a break.after reading about 25 unfavorable reviews of this show, i decided to turn it on and check it out for myself. everything that each of those people have said about this show is absolutely true. mind of mencia is like a half hour version of mad tv, but with somehow worse jokes.one skit i had the displeasure of watching was "the second annual stereotype olympics". what's funny about black guy who has trouble swimming, or gay guy named "sparkles" that wins a banana eating contest? neither of these concepts is particularly novel, insightful, or amusing. do we really need a joke about star wars every episode? that movie came out like 30 years ago. mencia's solution to funny things up is toss in some stereotypes about hispanics and throw a few "beaners" in there; and call it a day to go home to roll around in his pile of money. pure comedic genius.then he blatantly ripped off jeff foxworthy on a second show i watched, with a "your gay if..." bit. you could just imagine the roaring laughter he got when he snook in a ryan-seacrest-is-gay joke. it's not like either of those has already been done to death.unless you're a big fan of jason friedberg and adam seltzer movies, please stay away from this show. especially when there are authentic comedians like dave chappelle out there who can joke about races and racism and still be insightful.

i'm surprised that the comparison hasn't been made yet between mind of mencia and the television program the awful truth, which ran a few years ago. helmed by controversial director michael moore, the show would begin, in the exact same manor as this show, with moore interacting with the audience, and introducing segments, namely short documentaries and skits, which had been put together in an attempt to provoke thoughts about current issues. the difference? mencia rarely delves past the superficial and the reactionary. what he says and does is often pandering and rude, and insults the ability of his audience to make decisions for themselves. there's a difference between being "edgy", which i have no problem with, but mencia tries too hard to accomplish this, and ends up coming off as arrogant, and with little backing. he does however, make points occasionally, but often in order to get to them, one has to sit through some pretty mind numbing attempted shock humor.

this is a great example of what happened at comedy central after dave chapelle left. here's the problem with carlos mencia. firstly, his birth name is ned holness, and was known that until he was 18, when he switched his name to ned arnel mencia. he was born in honduras, though he acts like he's from mexico. he grew up in the united states, as well.i might be able to forgive all that crap, but...he's been caught stealing other peoples material. joe rogan has been his most vocal critic in this way. the stereotype olympics was an idea he ripped off a couple of dj's from miami. he has stolen jokes from bill cosby. he stole george lopez's material in his own hbo special (13 minutes of it).he thinks what he's doing is so original, but dave chapelle and lisa lampanelli have been cracking on race for years before this idiot (amoung others).this show will crash and burn. the word beaner can't last that long before it gets old. he hasn't done anything new since the first episode."wanna hear a joke? a beaner jumping a fence!! that's funny for 3 seasons!" not.awful.

carlos mencia just plain isn't funny! his show is painful to watch because of that. his sketches/parodies are all very horrible, and this really just feels like a filler for the chapelle show, which while i'm not a big fan of that, it is much funnier than this trash. carlos mencia gives the stupid speeches and he all too often depends on finishing his monologues with a retarded voice and going "der, der der." it's just not funny. he often, when talking to others, makes puns. they are horrible and painful. when people don't laugh, he blames them...why would anyone laugh, he's not funny. he has an immature sense of humor in everything he does on this show, it's amazing that anyone but 3 year olds watch this. one of my least favorite things he does, is water down every topic and make it seem like a joke! i hope that this racist idiot gets taken off the air as soon as possible because he's dumbing down a station that doesn't need to be dumbed down anymore.

what is it now-a-days that minority comedians feel its okay to slander their minority and expect to get away with it? carlos mencia is no george lopez. there is a difference. when watching comedian carlos mencia, i think he hates his own people. and more than that, i think he was forced to pattern his show as the "hispanic/latino/spanish" version of the dave chappelle show. what a horrible mistake. (note to mencia: please do not do a "block party" movie. as much as i would like to see santana, tierra, el chicano, christina agullaria, jennifer lopez, shakira and the reunion of the cast of "xica da silva" on one stage, don't.) carlos mencia likes to use the word "beaners" as much as dave chappelle liked using the "n" word. neither is funny and neither is acceptable, even if it's from 'their own people'. carols mencia also likes to say, "if you're offended, too bad". it's not the offense, it's the defense because of what is being said and asked to be accepted.carols mencia goes further - he disrespects everyone for what he assumes is comedy. it's not comedy, it's not funny. there is a finesse to being able to look at yourself and make others laugh out of comedy and not laugh out of enforcing stereotypes that other races believed in the beginning.mind of mencia needs polishing because carlos mencia needs polishing. find out what is funny and not what will set more prejudices in motion and then - do it. until then, the show, mind of mencia is a pass.

kinda funny how comments for this film went consistently downhill, now add mine. i think the script could have been saved by better acting, and the acting by a better script. together, it was difficult to watch, and i don't flinch from such subject matter.sigourney was the best part (i thought the relationship between her and her surviving son was pretty much the only new thing this film offered to its genre) but even she lagged. can't blame her, who knows what takes were left on the cutting room floor by the director and/or editor. the whole movie had an "okay, that's good enough, let's move on" feel to it, when i know there was more to be mined from the actors and the script, which did have some good lines and some interesting themes.i don't think this counts as a spoiler, but a perfect example is the scene where sigourney marches up to her son's supposed tormentor's house and has this look on her face and i thought "that's the face of someone who is overacting what it's like to see someone living in a mobile home" and sure enough, next shot, meant to shock us i'm sure, bully lives in a trailer as opposed to a nice house, like hers.as many other posters have pointed out, there are so many better movies with similarly airy scripts about similarly messed up families that hit the notes better -- "celebration" probably being the ultimate example that i've seen.

i just finished watching this horribly depressing drama and realized that, in light of recent dramas such as these, the only ones who could be considered abnormal are those who are least aware that life is nothing more than tragic. i would suggest how nauseatingly defeatist and counter-productive this conclusion is, even if relationships and outlooks like those presented in this movie are grounded in fact to some degree. but, instead, i realized that these films have made the very determination of the great "tragedy" trivial when the same boring situations, the same suffocating dysfunctional families and friendships continue to play out just have they been over and over again in some sort of attempt to knock out previous distortions of family life (much of it existing in the 1950s and earlier with personality and character aberrations being made ever so subtle), supplanting it instead with the "reality" of how things actually are. that in fact, what we are watching is no longer the dysfunctional, but in fact, a normal existence and set of circumstances that has actually existed all along, but of which we may have been previously been unaware and thus, have ignored or at least denied.only problem is, that too many films have been trying to make this point. and by doing so in nearly identical form. when i had read the synopsis for the film, i immediately thought of 'ice storm.' while watching the depressing lifelessness of the travis family, which seemed to endure repeated emotional berating, i immediately recalled 'american beauty.' and, in some regards, the interactions between the parents and the middle child, tim, i drew similarities from 'igby goes down.' 'imaginary heroes' may be a novel experience, maybe a refreshing one deemed so for an honest portrayal of character that, as said before, is often not permitted to exist in the films of family (which is idiotic to think anyways, considering we were already seeing these kinds of relationships displayed in films like 'ordinary people' as early as 1980 and which go back even further than that). but, to the well-versed viewer, these films may offer nothing new. they have in fact, become a rather tired testimony of too many filmmakers who may try to out-do the other with the amount of trauma and apathy they can pack into one family (and here, it extends to neighbors and friends). in fact, 'imaginary heroes,' the latest in this genre (i do think there have been enough films to accurately declare it a 'genre'), crams so many disasters and surprises into one family, that they would make prize finds for a daytime talk show host. it is the story of a family who is tested by the suicide of the eldest son, a talented and decorated swimmer who hated the sport with a passion. the youngest son knew this, the father was in a daze and blinded by the push for competitiveness in his all-star son. and it's not clear that the mother and sister had much of a relationship with the young man.granted, it is no less entertaining (to some extent, for those who find this material exhaustively depressing after a while), and the performances are quite good, especially by sigourney weaver and jeff daniels. but, i sure hope that filmmakers in the future wishing to add to the commentary of struggling familial relationships (which coincidentally or not always seem to be upper-middle class white suburban families) intend to offer something new by way of material and insight. i should see no distinction (and consequently, no purpose) otherwise.

this wretched psychodrama uses every shabby device in the book to wheedle attention and sympathy from us for its characters, who, with one exception, are not worthy of any notice at all, let alone two precious hours of filmgoers' time.as in robert redford's "ordinary people" (a superb film that, in comparison, clearly shows up the vacuity of "heroes"), a late teenage boy has died, leaving his family in the throes of bereavement. in this case, the death was a suicide, an event that nearly always poisons the emotional well of the survivors in a particularly corrosive way. we follow these people over the next 8 or 9 months.the father (jeff daniels) becomes a withdrawn, virtually mute, usually drunken stiff who secretly takes leave from his job for months, sits instead on a park bench all day, and insists on setting a full plate of food at the deceased son's place for every meal. he treats everyone else in the family with unerring nastiness. he sees his doctor regularly but the issue of therapeutic intervention in his obviously dysfunctional state never comes up.the mother (sigourney weaver) yells at the neighbor woman, among others, gets busted when she stupidly tries to buy "marijuana" (her term) at a head shop (what adult in reality would ever try such a dumb stunt?), and, near the end, swoons into coma with a lung condition that everyone in the theater assumes is cancer (she's a heavy smoker). ms. weaver has a few flip lines but generally behaves too unintelligently to merit much empathy. it's not that there aren't people out there who behave in these silly ways when severely stressful circumstances arise. but why make a film of such drivel? what can anyone learn from this pair's conduct? the deceased's older sister (michelle williams) is away at college and all too happy to distance herself from the family zoo. the younger brother (played by emile hirsch) is the only credible member of the family. his suffering is genuine, its causes multifold, and his conduct is coherent within the circumstances. but hirsch's character is too soft spoken, too morose and beaten down, to carry the movie. the other bit players, subtexts and cutesy, unreal dialogue don't help.the suicide theme is echoed in an almost nonchalant manner in the case of two other minor characters. so what is the writer-director, dan harris, trying to say about this subject? that it isn't a serious matter? why jeff daniels agreed to play the sap of a father as written in this screenplay is something only his therapist might possibly be able to answer. avoid this dog. instead rent redford's classic. my rating: 4/10 (c-). (seen on 2/17/05). if you'd like to read more of my reviews, send me a message for directions to my websites.

this was a character's movie. the plot wasn't that hot when it was there, but the characters were interesting and very well-acted. the story focuses on the travis family in the wake of the eldest son's suicide. i say that loosely, because the story is mostly about the surviving son and the mother, because if the father was supposed to have the story focus on him too, they edited the movie pretty poorly. the acting on all parts was very good, particularly emile hirsch as the surviving, confused son. the characters were all very interesting and i didn't mind watching them until late in the film, when it just seemed to drag. my big complaint, however, was the story. the son killing himself was supposed to be the center of the plot. however, it really wasn't. it was something that happened at the start of the story, but then everything went every which way. then they'd mention that the son killed himself to remind you that that was the central thread. the other thing was that the big plot twists, of which there were plenty, were never really explained or built up to, but just thrown in there randomly and often from far left field. in fairness, the ending was very, very cool. but it was also clear where the inspiration for the story came from: about half of it (the half that wasn't padding) was pretty much lifted from the story in the pearl jam song alive. which reminds me... there was a "poem" in the movie that was supposedly written by someone who killed themself. i could not have been the only one who recognized that said poem was lifted, word for word, from that very same song. i dunno, this was a movie i had hope for, and they really, really dropped the ball.

===========big spoiler================================== this is a terrible movie with no likable characters. so many clichés and senseless scenes. it needs a good editor but then there might not be any movie left. please save your two hours. the only decent and unpredictable scene in the movie was when the younger brother refuses to stop his brother from killing himself. the description read "moments of dark comedy". perhaps i missed those when i blinked. the horrible characters start right with the funeral. the funeral goers are laughing and complaining about the food while at the funeral of a very young man who has committed suicide? then the father makes digs at the only son left? right at the funeral? how is it that the next door neighbor whose husband cheated on her with sigourney weaver's character is the bad guy for telling the husband? the father doesn't even know his son can play the piano though everyone else around him seems to know he is a great pianist. the movie tries to shove every dramatic cliché possible into one movie: father over-driving athletic son to succeed, dysfunctional family losing a chosen son to suicide, the son left feeling lost and alone, drugs, marital affairs, child conceived via affair but raised as husband's son, incest, homosexual tendencies, bullies, possible terminal illness, etc, etc, etc. do not waste your 2 hours.

viewers of independent films know that once or twice a year they are going to see stories about dysfunctional families and they have come to expect them and it's becoming more of a challenge to keep them fresh but here despite the good cast it just seems more of the same. story is about the travis family who is trying to recover from the suicide of matt (kip pardue) who was a very promising high school swimmer. ben (jeff daniels) is the father who withdraws from everyone and has never treated his other son tim (emile hirsch) as well as matt but he does communicate (of some sort) to his mother sandy (sigourney weaver) who finds his stash of pot and starts to smoke it.*****spoiler alert***** sandy also starts to flirt with much younger men like the check-out cashier at the grocery store but when she attempts to buy more marijuana she gets busted and hauled off to jail. she doesn't tell anyone what happened but she does discover bruises on tim's body and also that ben has taken a leave of absence from work. after all this happens sandy falls ill and lands in the hospital where her life is in danger which forces ben to realize that he may have to come to terms with losing another part of his family.this film is written and directed by dan harris who has worked with bryan singer on "x2" and also the upcoming superman film and while his script allows these characters to have genuine moments of expressing their pain and confusion the story (for me) just has too many things thrown in. the script touches on so many different areas that you need a scorecard to keep track of them all including drugs, sex, love, infidelity, abuse, neglect, experimentation with homosexuality, and a life threatening illness. if all those scenarios weren't enough for you harris then tacks on a plot twist at the end that's supposed to sum up and explain most of everyone's feelings towards tim. while i did roll my eyes at least 2 or 3 times with the way the script kept unrolling one thing after another i must admit that i didn't hate this film and i have to credit the actors for that. everyone has at least one good scene somewhere in the film but i wish the story would have concentrated more on weaver and her character than hirsch. weaver is exceptional and with a sharper script she could have had a role that maybe would have led to an oscar nomination but instead we get endless scenes of hirsch at parties or his shenanigans with the neighbor next door. harris shows he can be a good writer/director but with this effort he just throws so many different things at the audience that the material just becomes labored and contrived.

the somewhat-belligerent brother of a suicide finds that he and his mother grieve in much the same way (by acting out) but that dad is morose and blaming himself. writer-director dan harris gives us a dysfunctional family torn at the seams, characters with question marks hanging over them, and then lays all the story-points out in the most obvious terms: suicide! secrets! gay shame! family sickness! ultimately aiming to wrap things up with a tidy bow, harris wants to make sure we don't miss a trick, initially giving us thoughtful material to ponder but then spelling everything out in an elementary, sentimental fashion. sigourney weaver's bemused performance as the family matriarch is dryly disengaged and she's a joy--that is, until harris gives her a make-over (complete with sensible new hairstyle). it's the cinematic equivalent of a condescending pat on the head. ** from ****

combining serious drama with adequate comedy is touchy at the best of times. looking for comedy in the muslim world pulled it off thanks to a topical subject and a fantastic script; not to mention albert brooks' excellent broodish character portrayal. but man of the year can't come close by comparison. it has a messy message folded in with forced jokes and a twisted love story that is completely unbelievable.the premise initially seemed very promising. put a jon stewart-like comedy news guy up for president of the united states and see what happens. this independent runner is tom dobbs (robin williams, rv), a successful tv personality who is pressured into running by his audience. along with him comes his manager jack (christopher walken, click), and his writer eddie (lewis black). seeming to have very little chance at a successful run, tom dobbs amazingly wins the election.but did he? eleanor green (laura linney, the exorcist of emily rose) is a computer whiz at the company who designed the new software for electronic voting at polling stations. she finds a glitch in the system that is quickly swept under the rug by the company's owner and his dark attorney alan (jeff goldblum, independence day). poised to lose billions of dollars if word of this gets out, the company's evil men decided to discredit and/or kill eleanor to make sure she never tells anyone. but eleanor is able to get to president-elect dobbs and finally spill the beans (this is where the unbelievable love story starts blossoming, too). dobbs goes onto saturday night live and explains everything to the world, thus removing himself as the newly elected president and ending the careers of those at the computer company ...oh, and saving ms. green's life.does any of this sound funny? the comedy is forcefully wedged into the story and is often awkward. robin williams blazes for a few moments during a debate but is quickly doused as the gravity of how he became president bears down on him.the message of the film is interesting and debatable, too: that special interest owns presidential candidates. i'm sure there's substantial truth in this, and if you wanted to make a movie about it you could. if you wanted to make a comedy about you could. but man of the year isn't it.

i was aware of man of the year's critical pans and unremarkable gross, but was prepared to give the film the benefit of the doubt because i know good pictures can fall under the radar during the crowded release schedule of the fall months.what i found out was that the movie is surprisingly uninspired. surprising is an understatement considering barry levinson's gift for political satire (demonstrated in good morning vietnam and wag the dog) and robin williams' obvious comic gifts. robin williams, in fact, is mysteriously underused. on the "making of" featurette that comes with the dvd, barry levinson talked about how sometimes he let robin williams improvise off the script, like it was some naughty secret of his. umare you really that much of a moron, barry levinson? whenever you have robin williams in your film and want to use him for his comic abilities (basically, every movie he's been in other than insomnia or one hour photo), don't cage him within a script. let him ad-lib whatever he wants because he is the funnier than anything anyone else can write for him and his uncontained comic rants can instantly raise the bar on any mediocre movie like rv or patch adams. what i found even more baffling in his failure to make use of robin williams was that back in 1987, levinson used this exact formula to perfection in good morning vietnam, injecting robin williams' bursts of comic zaniness into a war picture to make a resounding political piece.so the film isn't as much of a laugh-fest as it could be and feels awkwardly lost in its tone. if the film had potential to work as anything, it might have made one of those thrillers from the mid-'90s in the style of the pelican brief, the fugitive, or one of those jack ryan films. its plot centered around an employee at a silicon valley company uncovering a glitch in a system that reveals that the country elected the wrong president and the efforts of the ceos to eliminate her before the secret gets out, so if you replaced robin williams with some harrison-ford-type actor, or perhaps even harrison ford himself, added a couple more explosions, and maybe that's where the movie was trying to go. i'll never really know and it's not worth it to try to find out.

i usually enjoy watching laurel and hardy, but this is obviously one of the films they made while they were on their way to becoming a successful comedy team.the plot is all too simple, and is mainly based on one joke; how strange kilts and scotsmen are. and that's all. okay, there are some other jokes, but i didn't find them very funny at all; they are outdated and (i guess) were not very entertaining when the movie was first released.still, the movie has got two of the most charming faces in history, and they make the best out of the awkward story (which i expect was filmed without a proper script) and the scenery is nice to look at. in my opinion, watching this is only worthwhile for laurel and hardy fans, other people should stay away from it.

an annoying group of ex-students from 'monte alto international high school' decide to spend a night in the now abandoned institution where a 'mystery' killer called the watchman played by horror legend paul naschy murders them off one by one."school killer" features some references to such teen slasher staples like "scream" or "friday the 13th".the climatic twist ending looks like lilted from "the sixth sense".the uncertainty about whether the homicidal watchman is alive or dead provide some mild interest,but the characters are one-dimensional and the endless scenes of walking through dark school corridors really got on my nerves.the presence of charismatic paul naschy almost saves this clichéd slasher flick.there is also some decent gore on display including a splendidly bloody beheading.it's nice to see manuela velasco of "rec" fame in a small role.4 out of 10.

a whole bunch of teenagers gather around to discuss their fears, but an uninvited guest has showed up and is killing everybody off.probably the worst horror film of the 90's, camp blood (1999) is the only film that could challenge it for that title, has some of the dumbest characters and situations to ever grace a television screen. the so called surprise ending is awful, as is the rest of this film. mildly entertaining on a sooo bad it is good level. my rating: 2 out of 10.

this film is truly execrable in all departments. script, acting, plot, direction and editing are all uniformly awful. i give it 1 out of 10 simply because people turned up to make it. i would have given it 2 out of 10 if they had all stayed at home instead. avoid at all costs!

this movie really sucked.....hard! it was just stupid with a terrible ending. i love a really cheesy horror flick, but this was terrible! the "trick" ending totally contradicts everything you've seen in the movie, if you last til the end. take my advice and steer clear of that dirty old hag the granny.

granny is definitely one of the worst horror movies ever made in the history of cinema.the script was diabolical, so bad in fact that i was almost crying with laughter at some of the things they came out with. the acting was almost as bad, they would have been better off casting traffic cones to play the roles (they would have done a better job). the murders were laughable, the suspense was non existent, the camera work was ineffective and the "major" plot twist at the end was disgustingly inappropriate, it just gets worse and worse."the granny" is possibly one of the most unthreatening "villains" caught on film, she looks like she is wearing a cheap mask from the supermarket (the nylon hair caused endless amounts of laughter) and a frilly nightgown. would you be scared by that??? i certainly wasn't.if you like watching bad movies (see manos, troll 2, michael bay films &#61514; ) then this is a must see. those who don't like bad movies and don't enjoy laughing at shockingly bad dialogue, avoid like the plague.

this home movie is basically scandalously rubbish, but you have to give them 3/10 for trying. the blood is rubbish, but the granny that kills them is quite funny, and i think the concept is good, and make-up is ok for a home movie. however thank god it was only 55 minutes long, and the twist at the end is quite literally fight club (as in almost as trash as the film). just read this comment, don't watch the film.

this one features an interesting way of handling a camera,espercially for a dtv movie - the version i saw was full-screen- but it falls short on the scenario department. first you getaround 20mn of talk, talk, talk in a would-be-hip, post-"trainspotting" way, then it's slasher city. and then comesthe most dishonest cheat ending i've seen, much worse than"april fool's day" - where at least it made sense. so, all inall, it's the old song and dance : interesting director trieshard, but deserves better movie. funny : usually, it is the actors which are in desperate need ofsomething better skip it anyway, for your time

oh my god, this movie is incredible, it's the baddest movie ever and i know what i am talking about! i am a scary movies fan!the story is totally silly, a group of adults decide to make a party and a silly guy with an awful mask comes and kills everybody... the dialogs are a kind of parody, worst, they're just talking about sex with a so bad accent. the end is (oh!!!!!!) discover by yourself! you will be really really surprised... (not possible! yes it is!) and surprise the movie is just 58minutes. (not possible (bis) yes it is!) worst than house iv and howling v.to put it in a nutshell, forget it forever!!!

no way ! i hated granny. first, she is way too tall -of course she is, it is tom, whoever's brother, who's playing her- and i hate that thing she does when she brushes her fake silver hair back, but : there are funny parts in this movie. for instance, the fact that every single actor looks v.g. (very german), and also that they think that, even when left alone, they should pretend that that guy (tom) is their actual "granny" or something. i specially liked -not- that moment where charlotte leaves and starts walking to the nearest gas station to ask for some help. she suddenly finds herself in the middle of some woods (where were these before? nobody dares explaining) and turns, turns, turns a-r-oun-d like a ballerina, looking at the stars...and...ignoring the fact that granny's behind her, ready to strike !!! but, anyway, the music wasn't so bad, the haircuts were okay and the ending terribly provocative... mmmmm... wish i had the german version.

i love low budget movies. including those that are intentionally or un-intentionally funny,excess fake gore,violence etc.this,however is beyond stupid. once you see the ending you'll say,what the hell was the point of all the killing scenes with no one around(except in a couple) to witness them.and how did the ending actually come about(i won't give the whole story away for those dumb enough to actually watch this) granny is like a psychic jason. first she's outside the window with a body and 15 seconds later she's in the living room knitting. the whole thing is a setup for a newcomer. they pull off graphic kill scenes,the knitting needles in the eyes,that only chris angel mind freak could pull off. and again,the very end was pre-posterous. 56 min waste of time. i've seen one of the directors other films and it was almost as bad. give me 20 grand and i could do better. this really deserves a big fat 0.

an object lesson in how to make a bad movie which masquerades as horror. without going in too close i would imagine this is the results of a bunch of film school students all adding bits to the story and then actually acting in it! its like a film workshop of some kind and its a film badly in need of an editor-in which case it would have lasted 10 minutes! the director of this garbage probably had more money than sense. consider the number of submitted scripts or even unreleased films which would have benefited from this. the so called granny who was killing people in some pretty stupid ways looked like christopher lloyd in back to the future-or maybe the musicians johnny winter/edgar winter. it starts off with 20 minutes of crass boring nonsense spouted out by the students-something about paranoia. giving this rubbish 1 is because it can't get any less. it has not one single redeeming feature-and when one of the girls thinks the body on the floor covered in blood is the guy fooling about she has to actually taste the red stuff before she knows its not tomato ketchup! its an insult to the intelligence of an idiot

ok end of the story is - all the kills were a joke on the main character and no one is actually dead. yes i know cry wolf did it and did it well, but this isn't "cry wolf", it's "scream crap"! even though the "characters" don't apparently die, we see them get stabbed to death (and other ways they are killed) even though these "kills" do not take place as anyone can see them. mr. director, if you're gonna show people getting killed, someone needs to see it, if they're off camera and the character getting faked killed is alone it doesn't work - and until the end i liked a couple of scenes but your end ruined the whole thing.the acting is horrid (especially the kid at the beginning who really thinks he tricked his friends into believing they were playing with his dead grandmothers brains) the script is less-than half baked (though if you're half baked you might like the movie) the only reason i gave this movie a 3 is because a) they actually made something b) they got it released and c) they shot on film yes you read right, they wasted (at least) $5,000 on film stock for this crap. sad, if they'd shot dv they'd had some cash for a better cast and another writer to go through the script and make it good.i admire the fact that the director made something (as most don't) but hatwe the fact that he comes on imdfb talking about how "original" the movie is.avoid the movie if it means buying it to see, if a friend has it, it might be a funny movie to borrow.

this film is so awful it is funny, not quite to troll 2 levels of hilarity, but funny nonetheless. the acting is awful, the music is atrocious and the story does not make a blind bit of sense. the story revolves around a man dressed in an awful granny costume killing a bunch of people at a party. the death scenes are so badly done they are hilarious. one girl is stabbed repeatedly in the chest, but does not scream, try or defend or self or run away. she also manages to remain standing despite being stabbed repeatedly. another death scene involving a rope is also extremely hilarious. no thought seems to have been put into the plot. the granny seems to magically move from one area to another(e.g. be hiding under leaves in a woodland just where the victim just happens to stand, appears in front of someone even though it had been behind them ten seconds earlier), people kiss at extremely inappropriate moments(would you stop and kiss someone if you were being chased by a homicidal maniac) and the double twist at the end is utterly ridiculous, it seems they just threw it on just to confuse people. i would advise people to watch this film if they love awful horror movies like troll 2, the dreaded or blood gnome, but do not watch it if you are expecting a scary horror movie, you will be disappointed

i watched this movie at a party, we were very puzzled by the ending, it ended rather poor. even though the entire movie isn't too amazing, i was expecting something slightly better. this movie is pure trash, but i suggest you watch it if you find cheap horror films with a weak script quite funny. personally i loved the advert, it was my overall highlight, the fighting scenes were basic, a shot of a knife, some shadows in a window, fake blood. i must say the granny costume was quite scary, this film is a mixture of kill joy, camp blood and boggy creek 2,except this film has slightly better camera wok and colour treatment compared with camp blood.

granny, directed by boris pavlovsky (who?), sees eight friends experiencing a night of terror when a psycho-killer dressed in a old hag rubber mask and a nightdress interrupts their party.they say you can't judge a book by its cover, but it appears that the same is not true of dvds: i was in the mood for a really bad horror film last night, and since the cover of granny featured a shoddily photo-shopped image of the titular killer swinging an axe, terrible typography (they even use the system font sand, a definite design no-no!), and credits featuring absolutely no-one i had heard of, i reckoned it would be pretty lousy.it was!when a film clocks in at just under an hour long, it really shouldn't waste too much time before getting to the action; granny, however, spends the first 20 minutes or so with its unlikable group of friends indulging in pointless games and extremely banal conversation. anyone who actually stays with the film long enough for the killing to begin (and i doubt most sane people would bother) will be treated to several dreadful death scenes featuring amateurish gore, loads of awful acting, and a surprise ending that comes as no surprise (if you've seen april fool's day, then you'll guess what the twist is way before it is revealed).granny is uninspired, unexciting, and almost unwatchable. avoid.

truly awful nonsensical garbage. this movie does everything wrong except make the running time under an hour. the gore fx defy gravity & logic. there are no scares. the acting is abysmal, with everyone appearing to be reading their lines. there's a surprise ending that's just silly where we find out that things we saw happen didn't even happen. boy do i hate cop out endings! they pad this thing out with long drawn-out shots of people doing nothing interesting(like putting on make-up or talking for what seems like forever). they have to pad out a movie that's under an hour long? ridiculous. the story itself is pretty freakin' thin. i mean it's just a variation of the movie april fool's day, if i remember that movie correctly, and that film wasn't all that great either. the only good thing i can say is it seems to have been shot well. too bad nothing happens that's very exciting.

got this off of usenet, so i wasn't prepared for the heavy (and i do mean exceptionally heavy) religious theme. not that i'm one of satan's disciples or anything, but it was very heavy handed.on top of that, the acting stunk. it might be because they had to get good little boys to play bad little boys, but it didn't work.there was some pretty cool filmmaking involved, so any fan of directorial style might want to check it out, but be ready with the fast forward buttons.there was some sloppiness to the editing. in particular, a black mustang (probably a representation of satan?) squares off against a white 240z. wheels spin, camera changes, and whattya know, that white 240z is transmogrified into a white civic.i gave up early on, so i can't vouch for the moral impact of it. but i would like to point out that this sort of film is totally preaching to the choir. if the director/writer/producer was trying to bring religion to the unwashed streetracing masses, they went about it all wrong. i think i'd rather watch an adult diaper commercial than listen to a steely-gazed bible thumper rant about jesus' dying for us. yawn.

(as a note, i'd like to say that i saw this movie at my annual church camp, where the entire youth group laughed at it. i bought it when i saw it on a shelf one year later, if only for the humor i derived from a bad attempt at making an evangelical movie.)lay it down falls short of many movie fans' expectations on several different planes. most of the problems lie within the impersonal acting. regardless of the nice cars in the film, or the truth in christ's sacrifice for you, as a movie and witnessing tool, lay it down hardly delivers. most good opinions of the movies are supported by christians agreeing with the message. while it's easy for a christian to agree with the points delivered, the audience hardly ever witnesses life outside a cliché. the fighting scene between ben and his brother is horribly dubbed. and there are at least three blatant typos in the subtitles.i encourage anyone to watch the movie a second time with the director's commentary on. it really helps you understand just why the movie was written how it was. the director's views on secular society are practically opposite of what would cater to a movie-goer's needs: he shows a pedantic understanding of nonchristians, as well as some points of religious conflict; most of the editing, he admits, was rushed, but "satisfactory"; he thought the over-used transitions and themes to be effective; and was completely happy with the acting. he also inserted motifs that he was rather proud of: -all (read: most) of the names are significant. ben destin = "been destined", gus pelman = "gospel man", nicky d = nicodemus. -the car doing donuts is symbolic of the circling nothingness that is a life without christ. -when ben leaves on pete's motorcycle, he crosses his crutches to form a "cross".i'm not making any of those up. he throws around things like this in between saying while street racers and the like "blow their brains out with guns", and how "god is in control when your born and when your die". yes, that was not a typo. he really says that.i have (little) forgiveness reserved for this movie. the "cool cars" and "good message" don't do jack to make this movie good. however, the movie was made from a group of unprofessional individuals on a budget less than 1/100th of "the fast and the furious's", and the time limit was unforgiving. with that in mind, i give it a score of 2/10, instead of the 1/10 i so dearly think it deserves.

as a christian, i found this movie to be completely embarrassing. the actors sucked, the writing sucked, the cinematography sucked, and the story was so typical. i couldn't say this is a great witnessing tool, because i'd be too embarrassed to show any of my unsaved friends. hollywood has much better stuff, and that's because they invest the best into it. christians put out sh*tty work and think it's ok because "it's for the lord". in the old testament, people spent huge amounts of money to bring offerings to god. david (or saul.. i don't remember) spent what would be equal to about $50 billion in todays money on building a temple for god. but these days, spending what would appear to be about $30,000 tops on making a movie to "witness" to people with is just pathetic. it's the person, not the product that affects someone. don't waste your time trying to convert your friends with this waste of an hour and a half. if you want to make a positive impact with people, show them movies like the matrix, american beauty, braveheart etc.. movies that have something to say and actually get it into you.

apart from the fact that this film was made ( i suppose it seemed a good idea at the time considering bottom was so popular ) the one thing that puzzled me about guest house paradiso was what happened to the lighting ? there is absolutely no artificial lighting used in this film whatsoever , and i watched it on network tv so it wasn`t a case of watching a dodgy tape. in fact the film was shot so darkly it was impossible to see what the hell was going on . but if the dialogue was anything to go by that`s maybe not a bad thing

this should have been a short film, nothing more. the length of 1,5 hours is much too long, because after 10 minutes you have seen almost every joke. it's getting more and more on your nerves untill you finally kick out your brain to endure that movie.to do yourself a favor, don't mention to see that movie...

yep, this has got to be one of the lamest movies i've ever seen. it's utterly tasteless, has no style whatsoever, the story is so thin that you can watch television through it, and the whole film has so many holes you could drive an oil tanker through it.sure, i appreciate a good b-movie as much as most male white homo sapiens do. but this has got to be the worst i've seen. in fact it's so b that it lacks everything that makes a b-movie interesting.the whole movie is based around such charming artefacts as the characters beating the crap out of each other, various bodily functions and the complete lack of sanity of anything on-screen.it's not even funny. in fact it's quite the opposite. i found it even boring at times due to it's extreme predictability.i find nothing good to say about this movie. it was a waste of time watching it, and i hope others don't do the same mistake. if you also pay for it you should get a serious brainscan done.

the unthinkable has happened. having first witnessed it a few years ago, i have had a film that has been my benchmark for awfulness and that film was called "mccinsey's island". a family adventure movie with hulk hogan and grace jones (i'm not making this up), it plunged to new depths of movie making and is still the only film i've seen that made me wonder what else the film's budget could have been spent on. like new schools or cancer-treating drugs. however, for sheer and unadulterated levels of crap, any film will be having to lower their standards even lower if they wish to trump "guest house paradiso" to the distinction of being one of the very worst movies i've ever had to watch.based loosely around the puerile but amusing tv show "bottom", this film introduces us to two of the biggest losers imaginable. richard (rik mayall) is a hotel manager, as unfriendly as anyone you can imagine and so twistedly lecherous as to almost ooze slime from every action. his buddy eddie (director adrian edmondson) is an alcoholic waste of human life and together, they try to run britain's worst hotel situated upon a cliff-top next to a nuclear power station. between them, they indulge in cartoony violence (with sound effects) at regular intervals, steal anything remotely valuable or interesting from the fools who stay there and stare longingly at any woman at all. the plot, such as it is, involves the arrival of fabled italian screen goddess gina carbonara (vincent cassel) who is fleeing from her wedding and attempts to lay low at the guest house paradiso, much to the astonishment of richie and eddie. and... that's it.i used to think that the carry on films represented everything bad about the uk film industry and god knows, we've spent so much time and money trying to escape that god awful legacy. we've had films like "trainspotting", "28 days later", "four weddings and a funeral" and the brilliant "shaun of the dead" (also starring simon pegg) but this... this drags those films screaming and kicking back to the days of sid james and barbara windsor's top flying off with the aid of a bicycle whistle. "guest house paradiso" is so low in its ambition that it insults you the minute you watch it. i kept watching, waiting in anticipation for the jokes to start but they never came. just an endless stream of trapped knob gags, unimaginative scenarios that defy explanation, slightly amusing violence with frying pans and fridge doors and almost nothing raising so much as a smirk. come the first ad break (it was on tv, you see) and i was ready to switch off but my loyal duties to you, my readers, kept me going. "i'm watching this so they don't have to" became my mantra so you guys better remember how much you owe me for this because this was about as much fun as having sand kicking into my eyes and being force-fed dog food.trust me, i used to love the "bottom" tv show. the combination of suitably grubby acting from mayall and edmondson with ott juvenile humour worked... for half an hour every week. certainly not for an hour and a half, as edmondson and mayall indulge themselves in their little private joke and bore and depress the rest of the audience. honestly, this makes mayall's "drop dead fred" seem like "the godfather" and should you happen to meet either of these two people (who are pretty much solely responsible for the chaos on screen pretending to be a movie), feel free to swiftly deliver a boot to their testicle region. they'd probably enjoy it. pegg and bill nighy (both as guests at the hotel) are dragged down with this sinking ship but at least they survived. mayall and edmondson should not be so lucky. the movie equivalent of chernobyl and should be avoided as such.

wow, this film was terrible. it is as simple as that. it is actually the first time that i walked out early, as far as i can remember. this turned out okay, though: i had a very nice chat with two most charming girls while we all waited for the rest to finally give up on that crap they called a "movie".where to start. bad acting, bad jokes. faecal humour, which i simply cannot stand. sorry, but snot, pee and scat are *not* funny. you have seen the title picture? that scene actually drags on for about 5 minutes, with the two "heroes" hitting and mutilating each other, which is supposed to be humorous all by itself. it is not.apart from body fluids, violence and cross-dressing, i do not remember much about this. at least not much good. i was really, really disappointed by this piece of garbage. or let us be honest here: given that i am actually a big fan of "british" (i.e., black) humour, i was angry.so, want my advice? three words: do not watch.

i have always been a fan of bottom, grabbing as many videos as i could find of the series here in the states. the chemistry between rik and ade is always genius, and the combination of smart writing and utterly stupid humor seems to work without fail. i thus sat down to watch this movie with great eagerness... and was utterly disappointed by the end.the first 3/4 of the movie can best be described as uninspired and poorly directed (sorry, ade!), but with some utterly brilliant moments. unfortunately, these laugh-out-loud moments make you realize how less-than-brilliant the rest of the movie is. the slapstick starts off funny but eventually becomes a bit boring, with only the perverted sex jokes to keep things humorous.the end of the movie (the 'green' scenes, for those of you who've seen it) was... perhaps the worst ending i've seen in the past decade. honestly. it was one joke repeated about thirty times, followed by an abrupt ending that made no sense (which didn't bother me) and wasn't funny (which did).to sum up, i was sorely disappointed by this movie. i shall cling to the few brilliant moments in it, to retain the fondest memories that i can... but i have to warn you, if you're about to overpay for your ntsc conversion tape from the local importer, don't. there are far better things to spend your money on.

the premise of bottom crossed with fawlty towers sounds great! however, ade edmonson & rik mayall have managed to create a film that raises barely a titter. ten years ago, rik mayall's mad stare and ade's idiocy were funny, now they are just annoying.the film had promise - though the most horrendous hotel in britain is not a new idea - but failed to deliver. the saving graces were competent performances from simon (spaced, big train) pegg and helene mathieu, and the film is only 90 minutes long. sorry, guys, but you really have hit the bottom

being a huge fan of the bottom series i was really looking forward to the release of this film.i was eagerly anticipating a laugh a minute roller-coaster ride......alas.where to start on this mess?i think its a good start to say that its hardly richie and eddie on our screens in the first place as none of the jokes and one liners they usually deliver so well are funny.i was still waiting for the first laugh after a good 20 minutes of viewing.many aspects of the story were pathetic and it was as if the film was full of those bad moments they rehearsed and decided to leave out of the final cut.the overall sets and atmosphere surrounding the film is dark and dingy which i suppose is good if they want to portray the 'terrible' guest house the 2 buffoons attempt to run,but to me its just puts an even higher dampener on a sorry state of filming that should never have been created.the acting,at times,is pathetic.fenella fielding is wasted as the loony mrs foxfur and i've seen simon pegg have much better outings.i'd recommend guest house paradiso to anybody who is blind drunk because they might appreciate the terrible puns much more.but to any bottom fan who hasn't seen this film and is expecting true richie and eddie action you have been warned

i had seen rik mayall in blackadder and the new statesman, so i thought i'd give this film a try.at around 4 pm i bought it, at around 8pm i started to watch, at around 8.15pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain... but there wasn't. at around 8.45pm i threw the dvd into the dustbin. and that's where this "film" belongs.what ever happened to british humour? the humour so fine and witty, intelligent and artful that you find in yes, minister, blackadder, vicar of dibley, fawlty towers or the fast show? the black humour britain is so famous for? i don't want to insult anybody, but i presume even stupid children wouldn't find this funny. they deserve more intelligent fun. and rik mayall, you can do better, so please, do!

possibly the worst film within the genre in existence. it was announced as a comedy, but is simply tragically pathetic. i don't think anyone could have achieved anything more terrible and irritating if they were specifically requested to. it is toilet humour at its very poorest, i would avoid even watching the trailer. i only went to see it because it was announced that if you like monty python, you are bound to love this. whoever wrote that was either biased or seriously deranged. i am still bewildered how one can honestly believe such a statement. rarely do i leave the cinema, really it takes a lot of effort for a film to have that effect on me: this one did it in just 30 minutes.

i jumped for joy to learn this show ended. this show's characters were extremely irritating. none of them had one singing redeeming quality. damon wayans is probably the most standable one. kisha campbell is... kisha campbell. she's just as annoying as she was in martin.the kids are all very annoying as well. the oldest is an idiot, the oldest girl is a stuck up brat, and the youngest is frustrating to listen to.i guess i did like the intelligent little boy. but that's about it.it did the world a favor by ending.let's pray that a wayan never stars in another show... ever.

this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life. it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen. everything about it is just bad.synopsis: different situation comes up each week for the parent to handle their kids.i could not understand, what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season. the script is bad, very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc-17 movie. especially for the young boy character where all he does is pleasuring himself, is that what one called family show humor? the casting is also horrible, cause all you see is a really really bad actors, period.final word: this show is a real torture!! this show provides an image of how irresponsible parent can be (using power wrongly rather than understanding). it is zillion times away from reality. listen to kenny g would be a god sends compare to this. watching washing machine twirling around wouldn't hurt your eyes as much as this show.rating: 0/10 (grade: z) note: the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show.

i recently waisted 8  by going and see this movie in the cinema. it was a waste of time and the only feeling you get going out of the theater is a slightly nauseous of all the disgusting social pornography. it could have been interesting if it had a quite absurd twist but it hadn't so it was just plain awful with maybe one or two scenes which could have been taken out and made to very nice short movies.another thing i thought about is the way the director uses all the finish stereotypes as characters. it is quite extraordinary how you as a finish director can make a movie with the worst stereotypes of your own nationality. it was sad to sit and and hear the audience sitting and laughing at things that they thought was typical finish but in general just is making fun of people.

if this is what's best in the finnish cinema at the moment, i'd say those big tax euros spent at supporting "culture" have gone to waste here in a horrible way. paha maa is the worst kind of example of trying to make a finnish "european film" for big audiences. i'm sure they wanted it to be all state-of-the-art, smart and touching at the same time. the result is crap.to make it short: - the story is pretentious, naïve and not credible. the same goes for the characters. i can imagine them brainstorming about making a film where "everything would, like, turn to ***t and people would be hurt and feel, you know, really bad inside, because finnish people are so notoriously depressed, too, and their self-esteem is so bad", which brings us to the fact that...- the film is loaded with clichés, mostly about "the finnish mentality". the way the it deals with people's problems and their causes could be straight out of a regular women's magazine or a cheap bull-psychology-self-help book. ("we feel so bad inside!") i'm sure they watched some kaurismäki, too, to find out what it is about his films that people like, misunderstood him completely, and came up with a boring, depressing story about people going through all kinds of s**t for no other artistic purpose than perhaps social pornography. it's a crying shame they threw in tolstoy here. it's just a sign of trying to be smart. and of not being.- i think the worst fault, however, is the complete lack of vision and depth. the film is highly unoriginal. it is also frustrating to watch endless sulking and suffering without any real revelation brought to it. i can go through this kind of mind**ck if the film is funny or ends up being an elaborate joke, or better yet, something sublime like in e.g. von trier's breaking the waves. there was none these in paha maa. actually though, i did start laughing at some point because the turn of events was again just too predictable, over-the-top and incredible.who does this crap? and who likes it? i hope they're pretending.

let's see. this movie is many things to different people. to finns, as shown by the comments, it can be ok or dreadful or boring. to other folks, it can be something different. first off: if you do not speak finnish (i do), you will understand half of what is going on, as subtitles are dreadful and even the title is translated incorrectly ("paha maa" would probably be idiomatically translated as badlands in uk english).why did i not like it? because it is a tarantino-style movie: it simply takes a very harsh reality and throws it back at you, as brutally as possible. i, however, am not american, and thus i am not particularly fond of this proceeding, because all it does is show that the director has really nothing new to say. technical prowess (camera work is brilliant), script (not that unoriginal) do not rescue this movie from the bottom where it belongs. should you wish to see a finnish movie, then go for any of the kaurismäki brothers' movie, who match talent and directorial skill, with very good actresses and actors. this director ought to review his intention and priorities: none was intelligible, and thus this film failed. by not watching it you won't miss much.

please don't waste your money on this sorry excuse for a motion picture. the only way i could see someone watching this is if they are a die-hard fan of erika elaniak, but you would be better off surfing the internet than to watch this piece of crap. i would rather watch paint dry than go through watching this. they lure you in with casper and erika and lead you to believe it is a sci-fi dracula movie, but it quickly works out to be a farce about van helsing's great-great (you get the point) grandson, here ironically for one last show-down between himself and dracula.the movie also tries to make a political statement, i believe, when it appears that none of the characters in the future know who god is, that they have not been taught about him and don't understand when they see a cross. could have done a lot more with this idea. it's a shame it turned out the way it did.

it is quite rare that a movie comes along that is so useless, that i with imdb allowed the use of negative scores. in fact, i reflect back upon this movie and i truly cannot think of a movie that had so little going for it. acting: your kidding right. direction: no. a plot: no. this movie has nothing going for it if you take it as a serious movie, this is often the case with movies of this genre, but most movies of this nature can be watch as if they are a comedy and you can laugh at how pathetic the characters and situations are and almost get your times worth. this movie is so empty, that it cannot even suit that purpose. i have to give this a -1/10, three points lower then any other movie i have ever rated. i truly feel that the staff involved in this movie should pay me for the 83 minutes i spent watching it. i do not really have the words to describe how bad this is. no one should ever watch this for any reason again.

i won't reiterate what so many others have said about this film; i'll try to add a few new points. the coolio-as-vampire bit is a nod to fans who are familiar with his turn on the blondie song "no exit" in which he assumes the role of a rapping vampire (it actually works as a musical concept and is in fact a great song). casper van dien is no worse than brad pitt and is actually more handsome. and really what does anyone go to a brad pitt movie for other than eye candy? same here, although this is poorly filmed (check out "starship troopers" instead). and of course udo kier, after having played dracula in the morrissey/warhol film, has little more than a cameo. enjoy it if you can.

this was by far the worst movie i have ever seen! me and my husband own over 600 dvds, most of which are sci-fi and horror b-movies that aren't top quality, but still entertaining. dracula 300 had absolutely no redeeming qualities at all! the writing was horrific, and the acting was even worse. it took us a 3 tries to get through the entire movie, because we could only tolerate it in 30 minute intervals. we thought surely it must get better...we were wrong. i would rather watch a corpse being embalmed than to have to sit through that again!!! when it ended me and my husband just looked at each other like "uh..is that it?" the ending seemed like there was supposed to be more, but they ran over their apparent $500.00 budget and were like "oh, crap...we are broke..end it now...quick..roll credits!"

hey if people thought ed wood was a bad director then they totally have not seen this movie. i mean there were gaping plot holes and under utilized cast. shoddy special effects. i mean i cant believe that this movie came out from a hollywood studio. a high school drama club could probably come out with a better product. i mean they had erika eleniak who is gorgeous casper van dien and under rated actor. their agents should be shot to ask them to sign on to this dribble don't they read scripts. i still cant believe that tiny lister was a survivor in the movie i was banging my head the whole time at why him and not a descendant of van helsing be the last man standing. i am a fan of vampire movies and this is by far the worst they should stake it so that it never sees the light of day.

wow, there's a lot of venom directed at this movie, and a lot of it is deserved, but it's not the worst movie of all time. (that's probably "zoolander".)anyway, if you're high on something, really drunk, or just in the mood for a "b-minus- minus" movie that you can make fun of, this may be your cup of tea.yes, as others said, the first part of the movie makes you think you're watching an updating of the bram stoker novel. two of the main characters are named van helsing and mina, the ship is the demeter, and they're in the carpathian galaxy. you later find that van helsing is a descendant of the original, and he just happens to be on a ship in the 30th century with dracula. suuuuuuuuuuure.oh yeah, and to add to the originality, this "spooky ghost ship" movie has another character named ash. sound familiar?there's paper-thin character development and anachronisms like the aforementioned manual wheelchair, and coolio and tom lister talking 20th century black slang. but what really makes the movie ridiculous is the ending. if that's what happens to the characters, then the previous two hours have been a waste.like i said, it you want a dumb movie to play "mystery science theater" with, and your mind is in approximately the same mode required for viewing the "great vegetable rebellion" episode of lost in space, then you may find this diverting. otherwise, put a stake in it, it's done.

well it is about 1,000 years in the future and we have finally breached traveling the vast distance between galaxies!! but sadly we still use guns that shoot bullets, black men are still calling each other brothers, and getting high, stoned, fighting etc.. common stereotypical urban black men are still getting the short end of the stick! babes in tight black rubber pants that look like they're from baywatch share close quarters with the captian and crew. crippled people still require wheelchairs to move, no fancy cures, implants, or robotic legs. dracula still looks and acts gay. need i go on... in short this move was shot on a typical sci-fi set low budget props, actors, and no real special effects to speak of. the beginning, the middle, and the ending was pathetic. i have to go off and shoot myself now there is nothing left to live for.

...an incomprehensible script (when it shouldn't have been) dependent on a rather flaky voice-over.the animation, however, show real talent.quite visually impressive.

there is a reason to call this a teen flick. out of 100 possible points i would put it somewhere in the teens. it is predictable, the acting is horrible, especially the minor roles, and above all else it is super predictable. the ending is so hokey that i should have left early and maybe it would have passed. by the way, could you call the male lead a pervert? i bet if it really happened, someone in my school district would have said so. finally, in the school i grew up in, even though the average class had over 1000 students, we could have picked out a chump like josie as being a fraud and we would have singled her out of the crowd. my final word is save your time, when it comes on tv watch something better, like the stock quotes.

i had nothing to do before going out one night so i didn't want to watch anything too heavy, i picked the perfect film. this must have been a gift to barrymore from someone she slept with, the director raja gosnell has made nothing but silly crap and the writing on this one is just atrocious. in what high school can you register without a parent present and no proof of age or former schooling? they let kids all come to the prom with no shirts, in skin tight leotards, ass shorts and one girl was dressed as eve wearing only fig leaves? she announces that she's 25 and her brother is 23 but there is no reprisal from the school, parents or lawsuits of any kind against the newspaper for fraud or spying? the newspaper boss wants to catch the teacher in an underage sex scandal but doesn't realize the teacher is coming on to a 25 year old so any case would be entrapment? they allow a camera in and record peoples private conversations with under age kids? i wonder if i hired my younger sister to go back to hs with a camera on her and filmed under age girls for my personnel use i would not get in some kind of trouble??? nahhhh no problem. didn't she have to take gym or go to the bathroom at some point? the secondary characters in this were like cardboard cutouts of what high school students are thought to be and everybody was a stereotype. jessica alba is just embarrassingly bad in this mugging for the camera at every chance. in what world do the parents not get suspicious when their uber-geeky daughter is miraculously asked out by the school stud to the prom? and they don't ask the guy inside to meet him like every other parent in history. if some guy in my school or any other school for that matter had conned my sister and thrown eggs at her in her prom dress he would have been in a body cast for the rest of his life. this movie is so contrived and predictable it's nauseating, and why at the end is everybody (the alpo girls included) cheering for this chick when two days before they hated her????dumb, dumb and dumb.

brilliant acting, excellent plot, wonderful special effects! this is what i would say about this movie if i had been watching it with a bag of diarreha on my head for the entire film. instead, i endured a 2 hour crap-o-rama. our "brilliant" story begins with some billionare who has nothing better to do than look in volcanoes in a vain attempt to find his lucky charms. instead, he finds a 5'4" man in a cheesy rubber dinosaur suit and some queer cave-folk.in his infinite wisdom, (along with his infinitely large nose)he decides to go inside this volcano with a team of "special" people. to travel to this underground land, they go by plane? no. boat? no. they use this giant soup can with a "solid metal" drill on the end that i swear i saw wobble. in summation, this movie was faker than....oh that's right! this was the fakest movie i've seen! for those of you who haven't seen it and are thinking of sitting down on a sunday afternoon with this wonderful movie; i warn you! if you watch this movie you should be prepared to cut of any shred of your manhood and give yourself a full frontal lobotomy.eccchhh!! the rating system only allows for a minimum of 1/10. i give this a -10/10!

kinda boring, kinda gross, kinda unsettling, this wasn't horrible, but not too good. there's a good creepy bit when the statue comes to life, though, props to this scene. not much happens, and the movie just feels sort of scummy. i was happy when it ended, and don't believe anything about this being a true story....very surprised this is averaging around 6.

an art student in rome is possessed...or something. she has dreams of being nailed to a cross and satan himself raping her. he possesses her (i think) and turns her into a sex addict. that's about all i could take and i turned it off.a pointless "exorcist" rip off. i caught this on cable back in the 80s and was horrified...and not in a good way! this movie is supposed to be a horror film but turns into nothing more than a sex film disguised as a horror movie. there's tons of pointless female nudity and the actress playing the lead has to degrade herself more than once. we see her being raped by satan (a hot-looking guy), masturbating, coming on to her own father...gotta give her points for bravery. add to that bad dubbing, editing (the rape scene looks like it was cut a bit), lousy acting and a story that makes next to no sense. the one disturbing sequence (her being nailed to the cross) almost works but the lousy "special" effects ruin it. this is one of the few horror film that was so bad i stopped watching. skip it.

wow! what a horrible, hideous waste of time this celluloid atrocity turned out to be. i remember seeing it years ago and thinking it was fun but now...it's just plain silly. not to mention the fact that it is a blatant rip-off of "the exorcist" to the point where it was re-released at one point under the title "the sex-orcist". the only real difference is that the producers have the gall to further discredit themselves by slapping on the claim that the events in the film are real! who in their right mind would actually believe such a bold faced lie? to make matters even worse, there was a video release in circulation with cover art that blatantly tried to cash in on the "rocky horror picture show" by throwing a pair of lips on the cover! how low could one possibly sink? do not be fooled by the false claims, blatant lies or title rip-off because you will be sorely disappointed if you do!

i just can't get it, freaks out on the planet are talking about this one as a must seen, they even dare to call it a (s)exploitation because the possessed girl is seducing priests and is masturbating all time. don't let me laugh. i watched the movie, seducing is only at the end of the movie and don't call it seducing,it's just bad language that's she is talking. and the masturbationscene is a big laugh too, she tries to seduce her father while masturbating, let me be clear, with her clothes on you perverts out there. it isn't gory or bloody at all, everybody is vomiting on beyond the door, well, let me tell, that one is for me better than this flick. only the last 5 minutes the possessed one is vomiting and having weird eyes. if i had know that this is so bad then i would never caught me a copy. if you really wan't to see a (s)exploiation about exorcism watch angel above, the devil below or other cheesy ones. a waist of time this is.

out of the handful of alternative titles in english, "the sexorcist" is definitely the most appropriate one, since this is basically just a shameless rip off of william friedkin's classic horror film in which they replaced 13-year-old linda blair with the 19-year-old stella carnacina only so that she could gratuitously show her ravishing naked body. i'm not sure what exactly satan tries to accomplish here, but he exclusively seems to possess the young girl to play sexual tricks on her! poor danila masturbates around the clock and tries to seduce priests and even her own father into having sex with her. the young girl is introduced as a smart and ambitious theology-student with an odd-looking boyfriend (driving a stupid yellow car) and loving, albeit adulterous parents. when she takes a peculiar crucifix home to renovate, the ancient relic comes to life and no less than satan himself (played by ivan rassimov of "jungle holocaust" and "planet of the vampires") starts to torment her. the overlong masturbation sessions and some bizarre nightmare sequences cover about three quarters of the movie, and then finally director mario garriazzo begins with the actual exorcism. that final segment is even more embarrassing and amateurish! the priests don't really do anything apart from saying some vague prayers but, somehow, danila seems cured all of a sudden. there isn't much gore, the dialogues are horrible and the producers seem to compensate every little flaw by adding more sleaze! this is one of the strangest italian exploitation efforts of the seventies (why the hell are they referring to "the rocky horror picture show"?), but definitely not one of the best. if you fancy clones of "the exorcist", i recommend "demon witch child", "beyond the door" and "the antichrist".

the film is somewhat entertaining, but the greatest feature is shalom harlow's laughable performance. it has been 4 years since this movie was released and hopefully harlow has gone through more training. perhaps she should stick to the more worldly, somewhat corruptive characters that she has generated in other performances.

as the film reviewer for a local gay magazine i automatically get sent any dreck if it happens to have a homo in it. chicken tikka masala is churning on in the background as i write this. i gave it my undivided attention for 53 minutes before i found myself involuntarily shouting - like a tourrette's sufferer -"this is the sh**test film i have ever seen". we're just coming to the emotional climax where the son is giving some coming out speech to his father at his wedding. father seems to be taking it quite well. an attempted honour killing at this point would at least have livened the film up a bit. and made it funnier. i didn't particularly like beautiful thing, for example, but could at least see why other people did. it was made with some professionalism and i seem to remember it had at least a couple of good lines. the lack of wit in this film is quite astounding - even the most mediocre sitcom will tend to have recognisable jokes. the nearest this movie got to being funny (at least in its first 53 mins) was the subtitled comment delivered to the fat unattractive female lead "look at her with her legs wide open - she's like the mersey tunnel." completely witless and i didn't crack a smile but i could imagine someone with a low iq (who perhaps works in a chip shop) enjoying it.i'd imagine it's some lottery-funded atrocity. if not i can at least console myself with the fact that the backers will lose a substantial amount of money as even a low-budget british film will still set someone back a couple of million. seriously, if i met the most handsome bloke in the world and, on going back to his place to make sweet love, i found a copy of this in his dvd collection ("man, i love this film") i'd probably kick him in the nuts and leave forthwith. and this from someone who's gone about six months without any of the aforementioned sweet love. oh lord i hate this film.

for those expecting the cover art and story outline to indicate another entertaining bollywood indian production, beware: no musical dance numbers or songs of production value exist to brighten the mood in this rather tired story of arranged marriages in the british indian culture - with a few variations thrown in. as written by roopesh parekh the script jumps around topics worthy of discussion only to cover them up with routine avoidance tactics. harmage singh kalirai directs like a traffic cop, trying to hold together the disparate subplots to the point of keystone cop tactics.jimi (chris bisson) is a medical school student who is gay and has a lover jack (peter ash) and they live with jack's obese, alcoholic, loose morals aunt vanessa (sally bankes) and sally's chubby daughter hannah (katy clayton). jimi's family is visited by the patel family from delhi who bring their beautiful daughter simran (jinder mahal) to england to find a husband. jimi's parents (saeed jaffrey and jamila massey) and his grandmother (zohra sehgal) decide simran is the girl for jimi to marry and arrange an engagement and wedding in the custom of indian ways - without consulting jimi. jimi discovers the plot and is too spineless not to go along with it, a decision which enrages jack and infuriates vanessa. hannah tells a 'little lie' to simran (that she is jimi's daughter) and the wedding is off. when jimi's parents visit jimi's house they discover the drunken vanessa, are repulsed by her, but eventually decide that for jimi's happiness they will go along with the fact that vanessa has given them a 'granddaughter' and decide to use the marriage preparations as a wedding for jimi and vanessa. jimi convinces the very reluctant vanessa to go along with the idea and before long vanessa is dressed in a sari, prepared for a wedding, and jimi, terrified at what he is doing just to please his parents, includes jack as his best man. at the wedding the truth comes out and to jimi's surprise his family adapts to jimi's true self and the day is saved by simply being truthful.the cast copes with this silly bit of nonsense rather well and there are some good performances: chris bisson and peter ash are attractive men and play their roles well, albeit without any indication at all of a loving relationship (the director seems terrified of showing the least suggestion of intimacy between the two men); sally bankes provides most of the laughs as vanessa; the rest of the cast repeat the stereotype roles they've played countless times in indian movies. this is not a bad film - it has its moments - but it is just too superficial and tired to make us care about any of the characters.

the plot for a movie such of this is a giveaway. how can you go wrong with a gay plot line and all the colors and music of india - a story like this writes itself. i'll watch most anything, but this was unwatchable. the sad thing is, the white folks are the most colorful in the film. vanessa was a riot with a mouth like a sailor, and jack was great eye candy, but everyone else was so boring. saeed jeffrey, who was exceptional in my beautiful landrette, did what he could but the story was so boring. the saving grace was really the background music, which made it ok to laugh at the film, instead of with the film, or not at all. there are many other better gay movies, ethnic movies, just plain movies. i give a lot of low budget movies a pass, but this shouldn't have been made, or should have been made by someone else.

another bad spanish picture. this is very baaaad. i only save the photography and the music of josé nieto. the rest of the film is the worst i've seen in years. paz vega is horrible. don't see it.

another pretentious film from vicente aranda. if "juana la loca" shinned of the same, at least its quality was superior (mainly thanks to the great performance of pilar lópez de ayala), but "carmen" is boring and full of topics (ardent brunette with a dagger in the stocking, poor man dragged to madness due to passion, sierra nevada gangs, "toreros",...)obviously paz vega is a pretty woman, but about its talent there're more doubts, and sbaraglia role is so stupid that results almost incredible. the script is weak and and aranda's presumptuous character influences the entire film. with these ingredients the result could not be good.not the worst film i've seen, but a complete failure, in my opinion.

dull acting, weak script...worst spanish movie in years...i wasattracted by the (naked) beauty of paz vega, but as an actressshe's useless, you almost can't understand what she's saying...about the story there's not much coherent to say...we heard of itbefore, but as this is a "modern carmen" we find a few changes: -the french soldier is now a basque soldier. -merimee himself is a character in the story. -carmen is a dangerous "bandolera" in love with a famous"matador" and she can speak fluent basque...can anyone understand this mess?

with matthias hues on the cover and only $3.00, i had to buy it. i enjoyed some moments, like hawks annoyance with the pleasure droids, but i only really watched to see matthias hues' scenes. i particularly enjoyed the showdown at the end. it was a cross between clint eastwood's "the good, the bad and the ugly" and "for a few dollars more" (a 3 man quick-draw showdown, with a musical pocket watch used as the countdown timer). apart from that, there's really nothing more i can add. the actors gave good performances, (all except the "assassin droid" whose performance was nothing outside of comical) but the movie really lacked depth and purpose; simply not enough to fill up 1hour and a half of standard movie time, so we're stuck with the main characters aimlessly wondering around from place to place for an hour or so, until the ball gets rolling. for example, the main character returns to the same strip club about 4 times, taking up two-fifths of the movie.the scenery really lacked depth and creativity, probably due to the films budget. i don't think we ever did get to see this "perfect city" of new angeles that was always talked about, in fact, when the main characters finally reached new angeles, its set in a factory or warehouse full of pipes and walkways; hardly the kind of "kingdom" the owner/creator of an entire city would dwell in. the "super-high security" of new angeles was also always talked about, but only a total of 15, maybe 20, security guards were counted, even when the alarm went off; not even close to matthias' approximation of "at least a hundred men out there".if you are a fan of any of the actors/actresses in this film, then you may want to watch it, simply to "add it to the list". however, if you value 1 and a half hour of your time, or $3.00 of your money, you may want to give this one a miss.

troma founder, lloyd kaufman is the crapkeeper in this anthology film made up of two films that were such celluloid feces that llyod tried to salvage them by combining the two into one anthology film and throwing in copious amounts of nudity whenever possible. does it work? nope, it's still crap that i'd have to scrape off my boots if i stepped in it.will anyone like this mess? sure, young teen aged mongoloids with the combined iqs of a vienna sausage have to laugh at something, i guess. for those who have brains that are even semi-functioning steer clear though and watch something less insulting to your intelligence, even "dude, where's my car" would do.my grade: f

"tales from the crapper" is gory, disgusting, tasteless, offensive, lowbrow and scatological. but that's ok, i was prepared for all that from my previous troma experiences. what i wasn't prepared for is that it's also witless, unfunny and boring. very little of the genuine anarchic spirit of films like "class of nuke'em high" has remained intact; in its place, we get endless fart jokes (to the point where you start wondering if lloyd kaufman is going senile, thinking that adults find loud farting so darn hilarious!) and a cynical, shameless exploitation of the viewer, who is essentially investing time and money to see a "film" that even kaufman himself seems to know should never have been released in the first place. oh yes, there is plenty of female nudity on display, but let's face it: the average porn film probably offers a better storyline, higher production values, funnier humor, and above all more respect for its intended viewer than this atrocity. p.s: kelly powers aka suzi lorraine (the blonde lesbian student in the "how to make your own movie" segment) is one of the most beautiful women i have ever seen.

i understand that this was llyod kaufman's attempt to save a movie that was the pits. the whole movie is voiced over since the audio reel was junk. the voice overs were so bad and terrible quality. as much as i love troma, they tend to be a little heavy on the voice over work. the acting was terrible. one thing i did enjoy from this movie was the quick cameo of trey parker doing the aristocrats joke with a goofy wig on. there are a lot of big director dudes in this movie like james gunn and eli roth (friends of lloyd kaufman). again i think this was llyods attempt of saving a crappy movie and trying not to lose 1000s of dollars. i won't go on and on but this movie was a mess. check out other troma titles.

while the writing was terrible, the acting was atrocious, the only thing that saved this "turd" was the breast count, but that wasn't enough to make me watch this again. all said and done i'm actually dumber from watching this movie. this was a new low for troma. lloyd kaufman starting the movie wearing a garbage bag and making fart noises should have made me realize what i was getting into. this was by far one of the worst ever put out by the troma team. the best place to show this movie would be to invalids, sense they can't get up to change the channel. to conclude this is not a swift recommendation to watch this movie just for the breasts.

when voting i was going to give a 2 but when seeing that 1 meant awful it hit the nail on the head.the portrayal of native americans as blood thirsty savages is deeply disturbing to me.this is the third film i've seen of d.w. griffiths where races of men are stereotyped in ugly ways.the man isn't able to tell his side of the story so i'm going to try and keep away from attacking mr. griffith personally.in my opinion the three films probably influenced the thinking of millions of people and their children's children.films like this probably made for many of the resentments that are still with us..some may say the camera work was great,the action a first for it's time.the positives are far outweighed by the negatives,it's like someone taking $10 from you and giving a dime back to make up for it.

this movie is such a piece of unbelievable crap. first let me talk about the pros: sandra bullock in a black bathing suit.now the rest of the story which is all pretty much bad. we have said computer programmer angela bennett (who's online profile is angel - how witty!!! i bet the directors cheered over that one for an hour) who basically checks other company's software for errors/glitches etc. so we start with her ordering pizza on the internet and then putting on a fireplace on her monitor (extreme computer skills shown thus far). this is after she finds some virus on a macintosh program which crashes the whole system after hitting the escape key. this is apparently a huge problem yet the virus created to do such could be done in about 1 minute with a simple batch file.any event, we move on. she gets this call from some other bloke (that works at the same company) and this fool says to go click this symbol which apparently opens up some secret internet gateway to a bunch of unprotected 'top secret' data woohoo! angela saves this crap on a disc and now the people that created this loophole are out to get her. this of course is only after she hooks up with one of the bad guys only before he tries to kill her before she jumps in the ocean off his boat, before she winds up in a random hospital.problem #1: you can't create a loophole on the internet to gain access to a bunch of top secret fbi data. where the hell did this come from? since when can a group of hackers control the basic flow of the internet (even in 95)? problem #2: angela would need proper identification before a hospital or clinic would release her. she could not just pack her things and go.then these 'hackers' or whatever change angela's id so she can't get help from anyone and conveniently enough all her id is gone. so she returns home and a cat and mouse chase goes on and on and on.apparently all police and fbi people are stupid and don't believe her. so then she has to utilize a bunch of tactics to enter into the building where she works (where the person who is now filling in for her is) and get back to her old computer. she starts talking to some other random bloke and finds out who is behind everything through some bs ip address that the director knows the audience is too stupid enough to believe.then she runs to some center to mail all this information to the fbi. she apparently has to use a mainframe to email stuff to the fbi. but then the same fool that tried to kill her before throwing her in the water catches her and easily hacks into the fbi again (wtf?). but remember that cool virus? well somehow she luckily gets that and even though the virus only worked on software, it now works on the entire system too. it brings down the whole mainframe which has all the fake information because the mainframe was just sitting in the middle of some convention... what the hell is this crap! anyway, the now uber virus works and angela (the real one now) runs away and later kills the evil dude with a fire extinguisher. he of course has a gun, runs up to her so he's like 2 feet away and then decides to aim. classic hollywood.all in all this movie is so full of bs and crap. anyone who doesn't know a lot about computers will be wildly fooled into thinking this crap is possible but not one thing is accurate concerning computers or the net. and i honestly doubt i'd see a multiplatform virus for mac and a mainframe computer (*cough lmao*).

i am a huge randolph scott fan, so i was surprised and disappointed to find he is barely in this film! the movie really belongs to robert ryan, who is the hero in the jam, and the one embroiled in the love triangle. good grief, gabby hayes gets more screen time than mr. scott in this movie!! for many viewers, that is not a problem, but i am from the walter brennan school of sidekicks, not gabby hayes...although i will say that his lines were a bit more humorous than annoying in this film than in many of his films with randolph scott and john wayne.personally, i found the movie very slow going, with a convoluted plot that was muddied even more by the unnecessary romance subplot. by convoluted, i don't mean impossible to understand or figure out, i just mean too messy for its own good.the direction is uninspired, and the two main bad guys have the most unsatisfying come-uppance at the end. the whole movie comes across as fake, unrealistic, and poorly filmed.just so you don't think i can't find anything good here...on the plus side, anne jeffreys is very sexy in her all-too-brief parts of this film. not sure if it is actually her singing, or someone else, but whoever it was had a very pretty voice. ms. jeffreys also had a couple of nice acting moments. the script needed either a lot more of her, or to remove her character altogether. as it was, her nice few moments weren't enough to help the film.lastly, there is mr. scott. he looks fantastic in this film and is the no-nonsense lawman out to set things right. some folks complain that his characters prior to 1950 were too goody-goody perfect, but that's never bothered me at all. i'll take him goody-goody pre-1950, or gritty and violent post-1950...either way, randolph scott was a real western hero.it saddens me to have to say it, but i would have to recommend passing this film by, unless you are a die-hard fan...there are so many better scott films out there that this one won't be missed.

this was a modest attempt at a film, though it appeared more like a tv pilot extended.some may find this unfair, but it looks like someone saw "the brothers" and "save the last dance", and thought "hey, i could do that too." well, not quite.while i personally found the movie predictable, somewhat poorly acted, and contrived (watch for the cookies), carl payne shows that he can carry off a lead role, and should be back on television. the leading lady (can't remember her name, sorry) was plausible too, but you keep thinking of julia stiles (she was the one in "save the last dance", right?) because this one was really stuck in "white girl" mode.

i would rather have someone cut out my eyeballs with a razor blade than have to watch this movie again. i watched it from start to end thinking it couldn't get any worse....but it did. the writers and producers should be slapped for putting this kind of crap on television. the actors are all terrible. get out of hollywood you fools and go work at mcdonalds sweeping the floors and emptying the trash. anyone that thinks this movie is even remotely decent should be hung. they are an embarrassment to humanity. to think we have soldiers putting their lives on the line for anyone that produces this kind of inane garbage. makes me embarrassed to say i'm an american.

poor casper van dien, his career has slid a long way from tarzan and starship troopers.in meltdown he's a policeman who just happens to be dating tv reporter stefanie von pfeten and her brother is a scientist who's trying to deal with a speeding comment headed for earth. but in the runaway comet business, even a near miss causes some real problems as the earth's orbit goes out of kilter.from the survival of the earth we go to the survival of van dien and his immediate family. his daughter's gangbanger boyfriend, ryan mcdonell actually proves to be of some use especially when he suspects a guy he knows as a crooked cop might mean the van dien group a lot of harm.my only question here is, why didn't they have bruce willis, billy bob thornton and the rest of that crew to deal with the nasty comet?pass this one up folks.

warner brothers social responsibility at its most ham-handed, with sermonizing every five minutes or so about how we're americans, we don't run from trouble, we face up to our responsibilities. it also suggests that if you're willing to perjure yourself to protect your family from clearly deadly gangsters, you're un-american. walter huston, looking bored, is the frustrated da, and the "average american family" includes such familiar faces as sally blane (looking a lot like her sister, loretta young) and dickie moore, as an allegedly adorable moppet. both are regularly crowded out of the frame by chic sale, only 47 then but playing an octogenarian civil war veteran, ponderously jumping and "amusingly" nipping at prohibition hooch and moralizing about how we're americans, dag nabbit. his st. vitus dance old-coot performance is tiresome schtick; it's like walter brennan based his entire career on it. william wellman directs efficiently and quickly, much like his earlier "public enemy," but he and the screenwriter neglect to show what happens to this family after the happy fadeout -- i.e., they'd probably be rubbed out by the mob.

aside from a few good moments of fairly raw violence, this painful film is most notable for making 68 minutes seem like two hours.it starts with an interminably long intro where the leeds family is introduced, including two insufferable tykes and their adult brother and sister, completely clichéd pa and ma, and incredibly annoying grandpa (played by charles "chic" sales). while sitting down to dinner the family is disturbed by the sounds of gunfire, and rushes to the window in time to see two men gunned down by mobsters in the street. the mobsters flee through the family's house, leaving them as witnesses to the crime.the rest of the movie consists of walter huston as the crusading da occasionally interrupting long anti-crime speeches to make half hearted attempts at trying to protect the family from the mob. it all winds up in a predictable manner.good points about the movie include a couple of decent shootouts and a truly nasty beating, nat pendleton as one of the mobsters, and the gorgeous sue blane in a small role as the leeds daughter. if you want to watch huston play his early trademark crusading lawman, try 1932's "beast of the city." avoid this one if at all possible.

all those who criticize the sopranos for its stereotypical portrayals of italians haven't seen anything until they've gotten a good look at this cornball gangster film which focuses on a family so irritating, you almost want them to be rubbed out.the parents in this clan aren't so bad, but their two little boys--one a total brat, one cloyingly cutesy-poo--are insufferable, while their older good-for-nothing son and pollyanna daughter ably compete for audience contempt. but the granddaddy of them all is, well, granddaddy. as played by chic sale (in full "dag-nabbit!" mode) he serves as the films moral compass, throwing in lots of diatribes about "dang, dirty foreigners" for good measure. if these are the good guys, it's no wonder the actors of that era who played baddies became the big stars.not that there are any stellar performances to be found among the criminal actors, but they at least acquit themselves better than the grating leeds family. the incompetent police officers aren't even given enough screen time to bring things down any further. only walter huston, as the district attorney, elevates the cliché-riddled material in his futile attempts to breathe some levelheadedness into these dolts.the film deserves credit for being an early entry in what would prove to be a very popular silencing-the-witness formula, and it doesn't flinch in its depiction of the hard-bitten underworld lifestyle, but there are quite simply better--and less xenophobic--examples in the genre.

a few of my fellow writers have covered this movie's plot elements so i will stick to some of the cuff remarks...1. this is entertaining - but not for the reasons you'd think. it's cheesy but somehow still watchable.2. tamra, daniel's love interest has to be about thirty. the christian girl that dan ignores is way cuter.3. muriel stole his shirt from mr. spock. also, if my guardian angel looks like muriel i'm going to have to apply for a transfer.4. okay... so apparently... dan is responsible for his parents' divorce! what kind of horrible guilt trip is that?! muriel says that it was dan's prayers that kept his parents together. i just thought that was absolutely ridiculous. listen, i can pray for my parents as much as i want but the only way they'll stay together is if they decide they're going to do it.5. i'll echo the atheist's comments on how this movie portrays non-christians. apparently they're all slovenly bullies.6. for something positive - david white is a decent actor. he gives the movie a little bit of credibility, even if he is the only one. he pretty much holds this film together on his own.

the glorious edward gets to move up in the world when his supervisor tells him that he can drop those filthy swedish drama movies and head up stairs to the splatter and gore department. excited along with his big anticipations for the new type of movies he soon will be going to edit, he asks all sorts of questions, about the wage, his workspace and lunch brake. well, not really. edward is maybe quite the opposite. calm, stuttering guy, on top of that, he got glasses. with the exception when he's insane. i guess that created a much creepier atmosphere.evil ed is with all reason a swedish movie, but somehow a magical force came across the good actors and turned their lovely swedish accents into stereotypical american voices. i guess that's some of the expertise an actor needs these days. the acting is very.wooden, as in they are inflexible, not bendable (well hey, what did you actually expect?). on top of that the movie has a jamming techno theme song, sounds like its e-type. in any case, this only makes the movie experience worse. since i'm fairly harsh against this movie so far, there will usually be a breaking point where i tone the level of happiness up. but there's really not much to say. the blueprints look good, but somehow 'hanz' spelt coffee over it and partially destroyed it. that's how i look at this movie. if the movie ended where edward is taken to a mental institute and they refurnished the parts from where he goes insane and kills people, the result would have been much better, but that's just my radical view. i would also like to see more footage from the lose limbs movies.there are also illogical things to discover in this piece of movie. let's to say that the actors really are american, living in america, why would they then work on a swedish movie, like edward did? and also, that delivery man, why is it that he never uses the doorbell which is located directly beside him? instead he goes away with tapping softly at the door. good old edward really got some good ears to hear all that while he is editing.anyway, this movie had its moments, it's just a shame there were not that many. but that doesn't mean i would not recommend it. it's a rather cheap movie, go ahead and buy. it's almost like i see a pattern for the price and the movie. on the other side; if you like watching dubbed movies getting crappier by the second this might be it. my verdict would then be a rock solid 4.

you know, i really have a problem with movie lists. i was reading maxim magazine a while ago and they had a list of the 50 greatest b-movies of all time, and knowing me, i of course have to go through and watch them all and write reviews of all of them. this is why you see reviews of movies like gator bait and barb wire and coffy on my list. so i noticed h.o.t.s. at the video store the other day and recognized it from maxim's list of the 50 greatest b-movies, and i decided to rent it and check it out. my only consolation is that i rented it because i recognized it from a list of b-movies, so i already knew it was going to suck. given the type of movie that it is, i can't say that h.o.t.s. is a total failure, since it is nothing more than a late 70s t&a film, and it never pretends to by anything else. the only place where it strays widely from its objective is in a ragged subplot involving a couple of ex-cons who have stashed a lot of stolen money in the house that the self-named h.o.t.s. move in to, because this subplot has absolutely no place in the movie. despite the fact that the rest of the movie is as well, this subplot is completely superfluous and unnecessary. the story is based on a couple of rival sororities at the beloved f.u., which exists as one of those universities that contains a grand total of one sorority until the rejects form their own in order to get back at the snobs in the other one. this new sorority, help out the seals (h.o.t.s.), is a sorority supposedly based on helping seals (the seal subplot is another one that doesn't really belong in the movie, and little attention is paid to the meaning of that name beyond having a seal running around here and there throughout the movie). this is going to sound weird, but there was actually one scene that i was pretty impressed with in this movie. one shot that i was impressed with, i should say. about midway through the movie, one of the girls in pi, the rival sorority, is pouring alcohol into the punch, and she pours some for herself in a glass and drinks it. oddly enough, what she does as she drinks that alcohol reminds me of something that charlie chaplin would do, which really brightened up the movie. obviously, nothing in this movie comes close to anything that chaplin ever did, but that shot alone raised my score for the movie from a 2 to a 4.as a whole, however, the movie is exactly what you would expect it to be, a lot of people running around looking for excuses to take off their clothes (i liked how the remove-one-piece-of-clothing-for-every-score in the football game at the end was one of the girls' ideas. riiiiiiiiight), and not much thought is put into much of anything else. there is, for example, a scene early in the film when a couple of the pi girls pour hot sauce into the refreshments at a h.o.t.s. party, accidentally getting caught in an incriminating photograph (the girl taking the picture didn't realize that she photographed them at the time), although the photograph never comes up for any reason later in the film. i've seen movies like this before, it's kind of like gator bait but without the violence and the rednecks and coffy wasn't far off. even barb wire is much the same, just with a bigger budget and more silicon. thankfully, maxim's 50 b-movie list contains only a few more comedies, because while these cheesy teen t&a films are entertaining every once in a while as bad movies with the occasional semi-nude scene, after watching h.o.t.s. i think i've decided that i like the bad horror movies better than the bad comedies. i'd rather watch a lot of terrible actors pretend to be scared than pretend to be funny.

when my mum went down to the video store to rent a film for the night my sister and i learned a lesson, to always company my mum to the video store! in fact the only reason why she chose it was because colin firth was in it and she *cough* thinks he's a good actor!it starts off with some beautiful veiws of africa and then goes down and down and down, and down. after this film i was very surprised that colin firth got as far as he did since this pointless film could destroy any actors career.the story is about a divorced women who's son is trying to matchmake her to a man called matthew fields who he met whilst impressing his friends because of his large house.nimi the divorce does not like matthew at all and is going out with the local vicar who does not like her son john.... and the same with him!i am sorry if you disagree with me and i hope i haven't offended you but to all the people who haven't seen this film, i leave you with one word of warning, don't watch this film!!!!!

this extremely bargain-basement blaxploitation/kung-fu hybrid was in my country released by a questionable dvd label that usually speaking just occupies with the transfer of pure crap onto disc, so that wasn't exactly a favorable herald. several other titles were released in the same series, like "the black six", "the black gestapo" and "the black godfather" and judging by all their low ratings and negative reviews none of these belong to the elite of the 70's blaxploitation hype, neither. "tnt jackson" is a pretty lousy film, completely lacking a significant plot but featuring far too many laughable fighting scenes and horrible acting to compensate. apparently roger corman  never too embarrassed to make some easy money  assigned two of his most loyal acolytes to rapidly invent a simplistic story that would appeal to fans of both oriental kung-fu movies and contemporary trendy blaxploitation flicks. the result cirio h. santiago and dick miller came up with was "tnt jackson"; the tale of an arse-whooping black babe traveling to hong kong in search of her missing brother. she quickly discovers he was killed by a criminal network of drug-smugglers and swears to avenge him. mrs. jackson smoothly infiltrates into the underground and encounters macho pimps, helpful undercover agents, loads of vicious kung-fu fighters. only one thing's for sure; they all want a piece of tnt's ravishing body in one way or another. i sincerely doubt movie concepts get any more elementary than this, but  unfortunately - all the other aspects suck too. the battle scenes are overlong and moreover pathetically staged. jeannie bell and the other poor suckers try really hard to stare menacingly and assume a tough position, but eventually all they ever do is kick in the air and stupidly leap across rooms. the cinematography is horrid, the soundtrack is vastly disappointing (whatever happened to soul music?), the few dialogs are poorly written and the acting performances are inferior. speaking of which, jeannie bell is undeniably a beautiful woman, but still she can't hold a candle to tamara dobson or pam grier. there's only one really good and memorable scene in "tnt jackson", namely the famous hotel room battle where bell, entirely naked except for panties, repeatedly switches the light on and off whilst kicking the hell out of some goons. amusing scene ... i just haven't figured out yet whether it's thanks to the light switch ingenuity or bell's perfectly shaped breasts.

now any blaxploiation fan will recognise the ingredients: big afros, topless babes, surreally bad fashions and some 'jive' talk. in this case add in a lead who can't act, a plot that makes little sense, editing by someone with no hands who has been blindfolded and the most god-awful fight scenes and you have 'tnt jackson'. not quite bad enough to be good, but not good enough to be bad, this is a wonderful mess from start to finish. i especially loved the endless continuity errors and the lead's white stunt double.this is so '70s bad far eastern martial arts meets black power that it hurts, but boy it hurts so good! i am ashamed to admit that i almost enjoyed it.

a young woman nicknamed "t.n.t." for being virtual dynamite in a fight and a knockout in terms of looks to boot, goes to the most lawless part of hong kong in search of her missing brother stag jackson. when she learns he has been murdered, she decides she will bring the killer to justice in a fashion only she can.sounds good, doesn't it. well, there's really nothing wrong with the basic premise as a starting base for a martial arts/blaxploitation action thriller, which is what this aims to be. the leads actually prove pretty good too with jeanne bell fitting nicely into the role of "t.n.t." and stan shaw doing well as the ambitious, power-hungry charlie. where this fails miserably is in terms of the fighting action it offers up. the fight scenes are totally and completely unconvincing and/or sometimes so completely over the top it reaches the point of ridiculousness which doesn't at all help when the basic focus of your movie is a kung fu action heroine. also the poor lighting, actors sporting accents making them hard to understand, the confusing camera-work and the sometimes poor sound doesn't help this obvious low budget effort out either any. this does deliver in one area which may delight some fans, it does offer up plenty of the t in "t & a", in fact practically every fight scene in the film is proceeded by some type of nude scene and jeanne bell actually does have one extended fight scene in which she is completely topless.in the end, this fails to be something you want to revisit because the fight scenes are so pathetically, laughingly bad.

leonard rossiter and frances de la tour carry this film, not without a struggle, as the script was obviously hurriedly cobbled together out of old episodes. when it came out, this must have been a real disappointment as it's also done on a bus ticket budget. attempts to move it out of the house - which is jarringly unrecognisable, a bad job all round there - with a picnic, fantasy sequences, rugby and a boxing match in the local gym simply don't work. most of these are just character-light setups for a solitary not-particularly good gag. that said, the interplay of rossiter and de la tour (and anybody else with him) is mostly hilarious; they even manage to make a soda syphon gag work, but you can see the struggle with recycling a literally uninspired script that changes plot half way through. don warrington has very little to do except 'be black', and due to the random script hacks christopher strauli changes character at least twice. and in the end, as he often did in the tv series (though you might not remember - read the scripts), eric chappell lets you down with a 'time's up' ending. were they that cynical, or just too desperate to be in the film business? rossiter and de la tour are always funny but as a film, it's a terrible postscript to a fondly remembered tv series. rip.

i did a screen test and read the script for this turkey in 1988. it was awful then and even worse now - i spotted it on vhs at the local hollowwood video and said, "oh, what the hey, for auld ang sine". yech.they had to shoot most of it in mexico after they ran out of money, a couple of the "stars" pitched bitches because they ran out of some kind of exotic fruit drink crap. the movie's plot is ok, i suppose, but i happen to know that the writer intended for it to have a spy catcher thread running throughout.dr o ended up being a cartoon character. he must still be whirling in his grave over in the kremlin wall.technical errors were all over the movie, not only with the infant atomic technology but with the uniforms, insignia, and military jargon. they were too cheap to hire a professional military adviser, of course. even mr. newman's august and expert presence couldn't have saved this bird from being stuffed for thanksgiving.

this movie is a definitive 5. i finally caught it on hbo the other night. i remember when it came out in theatres telling a friend that it would never be a hit because americans didn't want movies about history, especially movies that were more about ideas than action. i don't know if that was the reason fmlb didn't do well, but now, having finally seen it, i can add a few observations of my own.first, while dwight schultz has been fine in star trek and the a-team, as the lead in this movie he is off-putting. i kept expecting him to shout out jon lovitz-like, "i am act-ing!" he phrasing and tone of voice sounded like he was trying very had to be an act-or, on a stage where he had to emphasize strangely various words and phrases. second, i enjoyed the sly positioning of paul newman's character as a manipulator who, at every turn, strives to herd these cats (the scientists) along to get to his goal. third, there was some discussion of the moral implications of creating the a bomb, and whether the us should use it. probably not enough of this, or as in depth as warranted.finally, there seemed to be an awful lot of twists thrown in for dramatic effect. i don't know how much of the events in this movie are true to life, but things like having the test bomb slip in its chains or having a lab accident caused by a spilled coffee cup (and a scientist killed as a result) were stretching the bounds of believability. maybe that stuff, or events that were similar, really happened, but it sure felt like various scenes were added solely for dramatic effect, which undermined the whole tone and purpose of the movie.fmlb was ok. i need to read more about the actual events to know if it was over the top or just mostly accurate.

while everyone does a decent job in this film, i agree with the other comment: it's too loose and scattered, too much like a script-less experiment with really talented actors. as such, it isn't enough to hold your attention. having said that, there are a few really funny moments, one involving dylan mcdermott and a flaming shot glass that i think anyone who's been that drunk would find as funny as i did; the other is a split-second with an inflatable dinosaur. crispin glover does his usual nutty twitch-fest guy and does it fine, harry dean stanton does his usual nutty patriarch (repo man, anyone?) etc. good cast, not enough to keep it going. just a few gems, seconds long.

man, are you serious? did you read the book or watch this movie? well, if you did, let me warn you, it is bogus. mark furhman has been seeking a job since losing his job with the lapd. you remember him, don't you? he was the guy that lied on the stand and gave the oj simpson defense a foothold they were looking for. well, he has written three books since then. i have read all three of them. no, i am not a fan, they were given to me. however, i will tell you one similarity in all three, they grossly distort the importance of mark furhman. he shamelessly exaggerates his stature in all three. in "murder in spokane", he pretends that he had something to do with catching the killer, when he had nothing to do with it. in all books he takes great delight in running down local law enforcement efforts. kind of like his efforts were run down in the oj trial. in this movie, there are plenty of slow motion shots of ladies looking at furhman and lusting after him. many other shots have him at the center of attention, when in reality, i am sure the only thing people were thinking at the time was "hey, isn't that the racist that caused oj to get off?" this was an interesting real life story, but not a good movie over it.

i can't believe it! were they crazy in filming a movie about connecticut in southern california? for god's sake, there's palm tree's everywhere. in one of the opening scenes a guy says "welcome to connecticut" and throws down a newspaper, the newspaper says something like "greenwich herald". greenwich connecticut doesn't have a "herald" it has a "times" as in "stamford advocate and the greenwich times." (refering to the stamford, connecticut newspaper). maybe the film makers should have done a little research, i mean my god, at least get the name of the newspaper right, or film in locations that look at least remotely like connecticut.

this movie is trash because, out of many reasons, it is based on mark furman's book, which is also trash. let me must say that mark furhman is a racist pig that is just looking for another way to get himself into the spotlight - and others that right this type of trash belong in jail. for the movie itself, being based on the book, was horrible as well. the only reason that this murder case became such a big book and movie was because the guy is related, thru his aunts marriage, to the kennedy family and it is ridiculous that people still believe that this family somehow has the ability to make and cover up murders - they are just a family and middle america needs to get over the obsession. this poor guy, and his family, have been hounded by the police for years, they couldn't get tommy so they went after micheal. its amazing that he went to jail with all the evidence that supports that he didn't do it, besides the facts that the statute of limitations, among other things, should have kept this trial from being brought back after twenty years for the love of god, don't watch this garbage

i was so disappointed in this movie. i am very familiar with the case, having read not only mark fuhrman's book but also the far superior "a wealth of evil: the true story of the murder of martha moxley in america's richest community" by timothy dumas. anyone who watches murder in greenwich should be aware they're watching the mark fuhrman story, not the martha moxley story. this film is nothing more than an ego-trip for fuhrman. just watch his character strut around as if he is the second coming (yes, even being ogled by women). the actors playing the kids look way too old for their roles and the flashbacks to the 1970s are totally unconvincing. if there is any hero to this story, it's martha's family, her mother dorothy and brother john. they kept this case alive for two decades before fuhrman walked into it in order to make a name for himself. they, and martha, deserve to have the true story told.

i just saw princess raccoon at the asian film festival in new york. the gentleman who introduced the film congratulated the audience on their fine taste. "you could be at herbie: fully loaded," he said with a smug smile, "but instead you're here to watch seijun suzuki's princess raccoon." the audience applauded and cheered. well let me tell you, i would have rather watched herbie: fully loaded twice in a row. princess raccoon, an allegedly whimsical musical based on japanese folklore, easily qualifies for one of the ten worst films that i have ever seen. it is so wretched that its wretchedness actually makes me dislike other seijun suzuki films, which is quite a feat.there is such a vast expanse of things wrong with princess raccoon that i hardly know where to start. perhaps its worst faults are being both aggressively unintelligible and mind bogglingly monotonous. if the reels got mixed up or if half of them got lost in shipping the audience would not know the difference. if you don't believe me i dare you to steal a print and have someone run the reels in random order. if you can tell me which one goes where i will give you every penny i have.the first third of the film features a mishmash of scenes, songs (including a cringe inducing rap number), and images that don't seem to be related in any way at all. horribly integrated computer animation is thrown into the bargain, adding yet another brick to the immense, and rapidly growing, wall of incomprehensibility. it wouldn't surprise me to learn that the writer wrote down any japanese folklore that came to mind of on a bunch of note cards, stacked them up, shuffled them, dealt the cards out on a table, and then wrote the script according to their order.about thirty-five minutes into the film some semblance of a plot arrives on the scene. something about a shape-shifting raccoon princess (in human form) and a regular human falling in love. i hoped that this was be a portent of the film being something other than a series of perplexing scenes, but no such luck. the film continues in the same absolutely baffling manner. i wish i had gotten out then, but i was trapped in the middle of a narrow row. in retrospect it would have been worth the awkward scene.i'm exhausted just thinking about the last couple of reels. i spent every moment hoping and praying that it would be over. every big dolly move, swell in music, or scene that looked remotely like it was concluding things renewed my hopes that the credits were about to roll. for agonizing minute after agonizing minute it went on. and on and on and on. finally, after dozens of false alarms, it cut to what i was sure must be an abstract pattern over which credits were about to appear. then, in defiance of all reason, it cut to another scene. how could i forget? the completely unrelated subplot concerning a ninja being captured, urinated on, and boiled in a soup hadn't been wrapped up yet.i'm never going to get those 111 minutes back, but you can spare yourself the pain. unless you want to taint your memory or future enjoyment of great seijun suzuki films like youth of the beast and tokyo drifter do not see princess raccoon. i would have rather spent my time vomiting.

weird with unnecessary singing and backdrops. randomly much of the action will occur on stage giving the feeling of an opera performance. none of that explains why this is such a bad film.it's the impression that either not enough rehearsal took place or that no experienced choreographer was available. the acting is flat. even the sparkling ziyi zhang looks like she's just waiting for her next movement or line. you may notice the trivia on this site stating that she spent half a month in japan learning to sign and dance. read that again as 2 weeks and things begin to make sense. even worse are the little kids who seem to be looking at their parents at the back of the studio rather than at the camera.the cheap and cheerful sfx are just cheap and cheap. the editing is staccato chops peppered with slices of just nothing that adds to anything except annoyance. just imagine all the silly dance scenes from the recent zatoichi - particularly the closing routine - performed by your local high school drama club with one famous actress who speaks in another language (but you get her in simply because she's so good normally despite being unsuitable), recorded on a cheap camera and then edited into three times its length in no artful order.

this movie starts off promisingly enough, but it gets a little to convoluted and caught up in its stylistic charm. the set designs, costumes, and music were wonderful- as close to perfect as one can get. but the more i got into the movie, the more i felt like all this effort was for the director's entertainment, not the audience. although, i loved looking at it, except for a few brief musical scenes, i can't say i enjoyed it. the director shows enormous imagination, but if he had fun with this film, he failed to share that with the audience, or at least with me. i didn't get a sense of whimsy and i didn't get sucked into this universe.a big cause of this was (surprisingly) zhang ziyi. you can tell she's trying very hard, but she seems to have been so miscast that she comes off almost amateurish. she's a capable actress but she has her limitations. i've noticed in her acting, that she has yet to truly react to her fellow co-stars, a flaw that creates a void of chemistry. the language barrier in this film seems to have only exacerbate matters. she and odagiri act as if they're on separate planets. she's also not a very good singer which made me cringe every time she sang, but thankfully there weren't too many scenes of that. odagiri was ok but doesn't make much of an impression.i didn't even care for the characters separately. there really is a sore lack of characterization. the only reason to care about them seems to be that they're good-looking royalty. without the compelling love story at the center of the film though, it's hard to care what happens. the film also takes detours into minor scenes that added nothing to the story and was actually distracting. i had to rewind because after going into a subplot i couldn't remember what the heck they we're doing in the main storyline. there were also scenes where it was hard to tell what the action occurring was because it was so stylized.mostly i'm just disappointed because i really like the concept behind this and there are a lot of things i do like. the music and dance choreography are really great.the supporting performances are uniformly excellent, fantastic in both the acting aspect and the singing. it's just too bad the lead actors were so bland.

i think the problem with some reactions to this film is that - with few exceptions - they don't focus on the main disconnect, hence the main split in the audience.on the one side, there are those who are taken by the visual design, pretty costumes, and variety of elements going into the film. some children's movie fans love the colour and animation, and all the un-scary 'magical' effects, shapeshifting animals, and so on. some culture vultures like the complicated references, the layerings of different folklore elements, and the fact that they can watch zhang ziyi singing and quasi-miming, in two different languages, in what really was intended to be a children's comedy.on the other side, there are those who say that a children's movie should still have a point, that a blend of folktales is not a tale at all, and that it's easier to believe in magic when enough thought and care has gone into the technical aspects to make it seem real.in other words, the ideas could be lovely; but when you put them onstage they have to deliver. here, they don't.a good folktale - from any country - has a clear story, a point, and characters who interact strongly with each other. this lacks them all. a few over-sophisticated gestures to opera, western and japanese, are no replacement for a solid theme.as a fantasy fan, i must say that i've sat through some turkeys and loved a few, but this one really tries to do too many things - cheaply. putting in zhang ziyi to try to add a little glitter smacks of exotic flower syndrome. the other problem isn't that there's no plot; there's half a plot, which means that you keep getting pulled in, then dropped again as another none-too-sharply-executed dance number kicks off.the characters all seem to know that they're starring in a movie. unless you really like watching other peoples' amateur video, this ain't good. i'd like to test this on real children; i think they'd drop it for uproar in heaven after about 20 minutes.

sherlock holmes and the secret weapon starts in switzerland as the world's foremost detective sherlock holmes (basil rathbone) outwits the nazi's & manages to smuggle a brilliant scientist named dr. franz tobel (william post jr.) out of the country & to the relative safety of london. but is london as safe as holmes thinks? dr. tobel has engineered a revolutionary new bomb sight that will change aerial bombardment forever & he has agreed to give it to the british government, but those nazi's want it just as badly & holmes arch enemy professor moriarty (lionel atwill) plans on stealing the secret of the bomb sight & selling it to the nazi's. add the bumbling inspector lestrade (denis hoey) of scotland yard, dr. tobel's love interest charlotte eberli (kaaren verne), assassins, mysterious scientists & a puzzling coded message & holmes has his work cut out to keep dr. tobel alive so he can deliver his bomb sight...directed by roy william neill sherlock holmes and the secret weapon was the fourth in a series of fourteen holmes films made between 1939 & 1946 to feature rathbone & bruce as holmes & watson. the script by edward t. lowe jr., scott darling & edmund l. hartmann is based on the short 'the dancing men' by sir arthur conan doyle & isn't the tradition holmes murder mystery as it's more of a wartime adventure story. to neglect what holmes is all about, the solving of complex crimes & mysteries is a big mistake as far as i'm concerned & the involvement of the nazi's & the war as a backdrop to the story feels out of place, awkward & just didn't sit too well with me. the dialogue isn't great, professor moriarty feels almost like an afterthought as if they couldn't come up with a villain for it & as a whole it's far less engaging than other's in the series. however, at least it's short.director neill does his usual efficient job but you have to cut it a little slack & bear in mind that it was made over 60 years ago. it has no real style or imagination & lacks both atmosphere & intrigue as well.technically the film is ok if unspectacular, the black and white cinematography is fine although i understand that a computer colourised version is also available. the acting is alright, bruce & hoey do their usual comic relief turns & rathbone's hairstyle in this looks ridiculous & i'm glad he changed it for later instalments.sherlock holmes and the secret weapon was a disappointment when compared to some of the other excellent entries in the series, there is very little by which i can recommend it & everything that made the other's so good seems to be missing here. leave this one till last & watch some of the better ones first, for die hard fans only.

abysmal indonesian action film from legendary arizal triumphantly sculpts a template for future cinemax pap like 'china o'brien' and 'do or die' with erik estrada while simultaneously burying poor rising action star pat o'brien with a hackneyed backyard script and three cans of hair-styling gel to perm his impressive 1984 mullet. this guy's physical prowess resembles a more femme mark gregory and his next credit would be second fiddle to chris mitchum as "tom selick." powerful. at least the action is mindless and non-stop with some daring asian stuntmen risking their lives for what is essentially a poorly constructed movie by teens and/or meth addicts with no concept of reality. one poor extra gets gorno-ly shredded by an electric hedge clipper and many more are killed by getting hit in the head by odd objects such as a motorcycle wheel or cardboard box. classic rape scenes are tasteless and priceless and quotable dialog such as, "i would rather trust a rattlesnake!" are delivered with such exuberance and fervor from the third-rate polizioteschi voice actors. random highlight: some crazy dude eating live lizards. movie also holds the record for most cars driven through walls. 2/10

anyone who will pay to see troma movies knows, and appreciates, what they are going to get. having said that, i didn't think it was possible to make a movie this bad, and still be compelling. i found myself watching just to see how much worse it could get before the end. first off, it's an indonesian action movie with an american main character who looks and acts like the bastard son of "taxi"'s christopher lloyd and rambo. he puts posters of himself dressed up like sly's "cobra" all over the place and even has a custom built firing range (with action-posed cutouts of his greatest enemies)in jakarta although he's in the cia and has just arrived days earlier. there is a lot of action involving gun-play(no muzzle-flashes on those m-16s, only sound effects), motorcycles(that bust through walls), karate(where no one makes physical contact) and even some sex(where all the actors are ugly). the main plot of an epic like this should at least be reasonably plausible, but not here. it involves the world's most dangerous drug cartel going all out to find a "drug detector device". why would they need it? that is never revealed, why not kill drug-sniffing dogs? makes no sense, but, it is taken seriously. the actors are to be commended because they really seemed to think this movie would make them all famous and tried hard to "act". best line? "now dance to your grave you dirty whore!" best scene? rambo jumps onto flying helicopter, pulls machine gun out of baddie's hand, let's go, falls, shoots helicopter as he's falling, helicopter blows up, cut to mannequin thrown in water. f**king genius! if you can't appreciate trash, don't watch it. if you can, it's awesome. one last thing, did i mention it was directed by the three punjabi brothers?

on a flight back from london, i watched she's the man; apparently air canada has a crap movie policy. perhaps that's not the best way to start a review of this movie. amanda bynes plays a girl who loves soccer so much that she pretends to be her twin brother to get on a team at a boarding school across town. even if you check your mind at the door (on a 6 hour flight you have to), the story is implausible and ridiculous. there are some moments of humor, mostly from comedian david cross as the principle, but the intricate love polygon doesn't really inspire emotion, although is is cleverly mixed (with the caveat of mindless plausibility). the ending is just as ridiculously mindless as the rest. i guess if i was a 12-year-old girl, i might have really enjoyed this one.

this movie was different from most of jimmy cangey's films of the 1930s in that it was not done by warner brothers/first national, but was a loan-out to a smaller studio. because it was a "poverty row" studio, the production values are lower than you might be used to seeing with cagney films. plus, the plot is certainly one of the strangest i have seen. instead of him being a gangster, he was a good guy in this one--fighting for the law. this isn't all that unusual because cagney frequently played lawmen--such as an oss leader (the forefather of the cia) of fbi agent. but, to make him an investigator for the bureau of weights and measures was indeed odd--especially since, at times, he acted pretty much the same way he did in the movie g-men! all in all, a time passer and that's about it.finally, the videotape i saw this on from memory lane video was perhaps one of the poorest i have ever encountered. the sound was terrible and scratchy and the print looked very white and had lots of torn film and gaps.

first off, this is the worst movie i've ever seen. that may make you want to see it, but it is not bad in a good way. it's boring, implausible, poorly shot, ridiculously scripted, and lacking in cool disaster effects.worse, it is intensely patriotic without a trace of irony or fun, wallowing in a sense of japanese uniqueness and victimhood. everyone abandons the japanese in their hour of need. particularly the koreans. the most noble characters choose seppaku -- going down with their ship as their beloved island sinks. "only japanese would think this way," says the prime minister.if this movie in any way reflects the japanese opinion of their place in world opinion, the first thing they should do to rectify the problem is stop making movies like this.

i have just finished watching this movie, and for me.... it takes ages to finish because it is so boring.....and the storyline is extremely bad.now... where should i start....o.... the movie is called "sinking of japan" ....yeah yeah... it does show that japan is actually sinking but the action part is very bad. compare to the movie "the day after tomorrow" i would have rate it at least 8/10.the "sinking of japan" does not show much about the disaster that actually happening right in front of our eyes. there isn't much excitement at all...boring... all i can say...one more point... i would recommend this movie to have a better title... maybe something like "the romance of sinking of japan" because this movie does have lots of talkings (waste of time... talk nonsense) & the love story is extremely boring & have been dragging too long...honestly.. i almost get frustrated.overall... this movie does not show enough details of the disasters e.g. many people running like hell to avoid death..love story part was extremely not touching enough for me.but hey... there is one thing we should appreciate about this movie though.... & its has got good songs!

due to rather dubious plate tectonics, japan starts to slip under the sea. initial predictions say it'll take about 40 years before the country is submerged, but a rogue scientist adds in some even more dubious science and determines it will actually take less than 1 year! the government think he's a crackpot, but evidence soon starts bearing his theory out.this big budget disaster movie follows the formula set by any number of hollywood films of the late 90's (i assume, having seen none of them), with the scale of disaster and tragedy bringing out the nobility of the human (well, japanese) spirit in acts of heroism and sacrifice, and proving the power of love or something like that. i.e. it's as naive in its psychology as it's geology... we all know that half the populace would be out raping and looting the minute they thought the police had their back turned, and the other half would just panic and be useless.the film does have some very nice special effects, but is not as slick or expensive looking as an equivalent hollywood production would be. it is at least as nationalistic, humourless and lacking in self-awareness as that hollywood film would be though, and probably has even worse acting. it does have the hot evil chick from battle royale as one of the leads... but she's not even slightly evil, and is therefore much less hot.the film is much too long at 132 minutes, and gets worse and worse as it progresses towards a conclusion that had me in danger of puking. i certainly didn't care in the slightest whether japan sank or not by the half way point, and well before the end i was trying to think of ways to expedite the process should i ever find myself in that situation for real.but, it does have nice special effects, and kou shibasaki is still pretty hot, so i magnanimously give it... 3/10.

this disaster flick is a remake of a 1973 movie of the same title, based on a novel by sakyo komatsu. japan is located right alongside the pacific ring of fire (active volcanoes) and also along the edges of plate tectonics, whose shifting will cause earthquakes and tsunamis (a japanese term in itself for tidal wave). naturally, this makes a natural premise for a disaster picture, what with hollywood having a field day with films like armageddon, deep impact, and more recently, the day after tomorrow, which tackles how global warming becomes the catalyst for natural disasters gone bonkers around the world.but i'll have to say this: the sinking of japan makes all the films mentioned earlier, look like classics. this disaster movie is a disaster, and a massive one at that. having to look at my watch every 10-15 minutes is a signal that the movie doesn't engage, and feels than it had over-clocked its runtime.the special effects are gorgeous to look at. from satellite styled outer space pictures, to the vivid recreation of every conceivable natural disaster that can strike the land of the rising sun, the effects are the star of the show. however, having spectacular computer generated graphics does not in itself make a movie palatable, as too much of a good thing just plain bores.if you had seen the trailer where you're enticed by the effects and specific scenes of chaos and mayhem, then yes, in fact those scenes are just that. there are no details, and everything is seen from afar, in a god-like mode. things happen just like that on screen, with nary an attempt to try and delve deeper to look at issues up close. it's akin to godzilla knocking over buildings, and it's as if there are no humans or loss of lives through that single act. morbid as it might sound, show us the victims! a populous nation like japan doesn't just suffer disaster after disaster with an extremely low fatality count, not when the filmmakers unleash mayhem in such an epic scale.trying to weave a romance into the movie, it stood out like a sore thumb. there are many characters in the movie, but each one of them lacking real characteristics, or humanity, and look like wandering zombies, without expression, without emotion, and definitely very stiff and unconvincing. heroes become stuck in generic control rooms issuing statements, instructions and form policies, and react to incidents like it was a computer game, all settled with a push of a button. these are characters that you don't give a hoot about.if i may just use the day after tomorrow as a comparison, while there are terrific effects, there is at least an attempt to provide a microscopic view of the entire disaster from different individual's point of views. and infused within are plenty of action sequences, big ones like the disasters themselves, and small ones with the focus on the triumph of the human spirit, that makes it relatively compelling.unfortunately for the sinking of japan, this movie should preferably be one to sink and tank, and hopefully undergo a short and quick death at the local box office to make way for better stuff.

this film has some nice special effects, tearing apart the japanese archipelago to a degree that would humble godzilla. the two leads also put in above-par performances. apart from that, it is all a bit ropey in this understated disaster flick. the incongruities in the pacing are bizarre. at one point we have hokkaido sinking into the sea and pyroclastic snow falling on the rest of japan, while osaka is buried under an immense tsunami. yet elsewhere in the country, people are still strolling around sightseeing and licking ice-cream when another tsunami rolls in... kusanagi also manages to travel great distances without any hindrance, or even a crease in his cream shirt. other people turn up with burns, ripped clothes and mud-streaks on their faces. the japaneseness of the film is both touching and repugnant. kusanagi's sacrifice in his final evening with shibasaki is a touch of chivalry seldom seen in this genre these days. however, the ill-fated pms musings on the japanese psyche and the seduction of death, and the fact that japan is abandoned by everyone and has no friends in the last instance, hint at a darker paranoia that infects japanese concerns regarding their status in the world.sadly, the final sequence is a rip-off of armaggedon, edited with a cookie-cutter.finally, my own particular bug-bear - the heavy handed product placement for cigarettes. this time around, it is mad(-or-is-he?) scientist toyokawa who gets to be the poster boy for japan tobacco. at one point, he manages to light up 5000 meters below the ocean surface, in a miniature sub the size of a phone box. gimme a break.

may be spoilers so do not read if you do not want to just like watching the tv news , everything is already happened, a great tsunami looms over a city bay and cut , no more to see, tokay suffers a large earthquake , did anyone see more than the 5 seconds i saw? if you want to make a love story , make a love story but if you want to use a disaster movie title , do please be kind enough to show me the disaster , pd after watching this movie watch jishin retto or any godzilla film to satisfy the part that was willing to see people screaming and buildings collapsing that did not get a chance to do in this movie. don t take me wrong i love disaster movies and i love the original nihon chimbotsu and jishin retto, i even like the latest poseidon , not to much of a story there but a very good and graphic disaster sequence , new nihon chimbotsu looses the point as many times as pearl harbour or the day after tomorrow but at least this two movies do show good disaster sequences, and also enough with the expensive fx that did not show anything , give me fake buildings if you like as long as you do destroy them properly , i know i must sound like a sadistic freak, however i did go to see love actually when i felt like going to see a romantic film , grrrrrrr even kimpachi sensei makes me cry and this movie didn:t . there is also a tv series called napping chimbotsu made in 1975, i have on dvd and it is much better

what a terrible movie! it represents perfectly the state of degenerateness of french society, where the most elementary respect for wholesome values and traditions has completely disappeared. the plot is nonsensical, the movie is not funny at all and the characters are completely shallow and uninteresting. to say the least, the direction and the cinematography are very poor and uninspired. catherine deneuve is as bad an actress as she always was, even when she was directed by bunuel in belle de jour. the rest of the usually good cast (vincent lindon, line renaud, jean yanne) seem completely lost in an ocean of vulgarity, platitudes and restlessness. i cannot help to draw a parallel with the wonderful james ivory's "le divorce", with its thoughtful depiction of french and american mores, its superlative cinematography and stellar cast put to good use. having watched "le divorce" you can feel a kind of empathy with the french, regardless of their foibles. "belle-maman" leaves you with only a nauseated contempt for its morally bankrupt and clueless protagonists.

i rented the matrix revisited with a friend of mine. we both loved the matrix and we both love filmmaking so we wanted to see what was going on behind the scenes of the matrix. it turns out that the matrix revisited tells you hardly anything about the art of filmmaking or even how the matrix was made. it is basically a huge commercial for the matrix, a movie that the target audience of the matrix revisited has already seen!if you really want to know about the process and the troubles and the stress and the detail that went into making of the matrix, look no further than the bonus features on the original dvd of the matrix. there are things they show in those documentaries that i had not even realized had to be done or was done. the matrix was such a difficult and challenging film to make that it deserves more credit than a "documentary" that's about as informative and interesting as an mtv special.

to quote one critic's review of the movie, "it started off slow and stopped." the plot was believeable enough (although some of the characters' actions seemed very, very random), the script was fairly well written (in that the dialogue did not seem forced), but everything went way too slowly. there were too many pauses between lines, and the way the lines were delivered was not all that great. this movie had potential, but blew it like a teenager turning to drugs. my advice? wait for it to come on tv before you see it.

harrison ford plays sergeant dutch van den broeck of the district of columbia police department. he tries to get the bad guys, but doesn't do a very good job. when we meet up with him he's trying to catch a corrupt undercover officer. kristin scott thomas plays a new hampshire senator, kay chandler, trying to get reelected. she's running against a candidate who has plenty of money. the last thing she needs is the death of her husband. she's a politician- she can't be bogged down by feelings.this story moves slowly and painfully. i was looking at my watch every five minutes wondering when it would be over! the story gets lost in details the director, sydney pollack, didn't need to put in. we don't want to know about dutch's police investigations. they throw in some insight to politicians and the spin control' they do for campaigns. after seeing the movie i'm still wondering why they got involved romantically. doesn't anybody mourn anymore? don't you need more than two weeks to even consider going horizontal' with someone else?it was good to see actress, comedian, chicago native and second city alumni bonnie hunt. her role isn't necessarily comic relief, but she was the only one i wanted to see more of. do yourself a favor, wait for it on video if you want to see it at all.

two things -- too long and totally lacked credibility. this movie didn't make any sense and was excrutiating to sit through. i am usually pretty patient, but man... it just doesn't keep your attention at all! i think i am being nice here even! you keep thinking it's almost over only to find out it's still got another half hour! good actors.

i really like harrison ford so i eagerly rented this movie only to be disappointed minute after minute. mr. ford seemed to be walking through very warm water looking for a place to urinate. his co-star was very good and had the better lines. the story intrigued me but the mistake - big mistake - as everyone is identified via driver's license or passport before they board any american commercial aircraft left numerous plot questions in my mind. i could have cared less about these people. in fact, the sub-plot of the internal affairs investigation was more interesting than the two lovers killed while flying first class to miami.i am disappointed in the director, sydney pollack who gave us the classic tootsie and other films. this one is a waste of time and energy.

i clerk in a video store, so i try to see the movies we're about to put out each week. i don't have a problem with this; in fact, i sort of feel it's a privilege. not so with this film . . . after an hour and a half of our hero whining and growling his way through scene after scene, i was truly wondering if they planned to get to the point. i felt like i should be getting paid for watching this at home, in my free time. and if i'd known there was another hour to be endured, i might have given up right then. i didn't care about the characters, the filming was unremarkable, and ford made kissing look like a chore. even the score was incongruous and jarring. what a waste.

being a harrison ford fan i am probably being kind. it was predictable, sappy...my husband made a lot of gagging sounds while we were watching it. what a disappointing movie. our local newspaper (san jose mercury news) actually gave this 4 stars out of 4 stars!!! hard to believe that the reviewer saw the same movie we did.

motivations of the characters was completely unbelievable. many times throughout the movie you find yourself thinking that the characters' actions were totally illogical, making it impossible to identify with the characters. possibly, the writing / direction were completely out of sync making the movie painful to sit through. i wanted my money back from the video store...

why is it that such "romantic" movies that never actually go anywhere, always start (and probably end) with crappy jazz? it's not clever and it makes it look like a bloody tv-movie. this film was sappy, slow paced, boring, unoriginal, wooden and did i say boring?harrison ford was probably trying to be mysterious and crude, but he was just a crawling, mumbling cop that seemed to walk into the congress-woman's home like everything was fine, when he behaved like a pervert - staring at thomas with a pervy glare, hardly ever bothering to speak.and why the hell do they always get british actors to put on crappy accents - they're casted because they're famous, and everybody knows they're british precisely because they're famous!

so much great chemistry between kristen scott-thomas and harrison ford, but every time the story about their relationship began to gather momentum the script cut away and dealt with some irrelevant sub-plot that did nothing to advance the story. indeed, the subplots had nothing to do with the story at all. they were like commercial breaks in which you watched a trailer for another movie. the writers (or someone who controlled the writers) obviously didn't trust themselves to write compellingly about relationships and the interior lives of their characters. they seemed to be uncomfortable unless they threw in some gun battles and bar fights. or perhaps they didn't trust the audience to pay attention to a story about a man and a woman trying to understand their relationship under difficult circumstances. after all, we all know how boring "casablanca" was. perhaps if the relationship between kay and dutch had been developed more and had been allowed to play out, the writers would have know how to end the story. this film is a disappointment for not doing more with its wonderful actors, who gave good performances but could have done more with a better script.

it wasn't until i saw sidney pollack in the picture that i ever connected him to this film. this is his worst possible movie. absolute dreck. the dialog is wooden and unbelievable, the plot is unbelievable.kristen scott thomas is wasted in this movie. there is nothing about her character that makes you even want to believe in this story.harrison ford is like on valium. there is no life in his eyes.i blame sidney pollack for the failure of this movie. the script is awful, and he is too smart to not see that. so it smacks of some kind of payoff, whether of a studio obligation or something else, but this is just bloody rotten!

nothing could be more appealing than the idea of a good love story featuring kristin scott thomas and harrison ford. the cool, refined english beauty and the warm-blooded american male -- what could possibly be more lovely? well, this is not that movie. right away they ruin it by casting kristin scott thomas as an american congresswoman. that's like casting hugh grant as babe ruth. or colin firth as al capone. kristin scott thomas is exactly the sort of woman you don't picture shaking hands with greasy ex-junkies in filthy slums, or squeezing into smelly crowds and kissing babies. she would have been far better cast as the english born widow of an aristocratic senator, the kind who belongs to the hunt club and goes to flower shows but has no idea how the other half lives.then there's harrison ford as a regular guy cop. certainly he's tough enough for the role. but the idea that he's going to romance this stunning high society beauty is a bit hard to swallow. why couldn't he have been, say, a tough but wealthy reform politician with blue-collar roots who inherits kristin's late husband's senate seat? the two of them are initially quite cool to each other, but for duty's sake kristin is cordial to him, and he in return starts showing her some of the rawer side of life -- things her husband sheltered her from. her political awakening coincides with the jolting passion of a newer, more blue collar, lover -- one who appreciates her polish and refinement far more than her aristocratic husband. now that's a love story! instead of that, though, you get a blank, meaningless "thriller" where the action drags and nothing happens. well, there is one ghetto style "drive by" scene where harrison almost gets killed, but it's so abrupt and unexplained it's really more like welcome comic relief.the sky is always gray in this movie, and our refined, lovely kristin always looks a little chilled. when she's supposed to be dreaming of passion, she looks more like she's dreaming of a wool blanket and a cup of tea! she also looks a bit sleepy most of the time, like she'd really rather be napping in the bed than screwing harrison ford.all things considered, i'd say you can't blame her.

unusually cold and silly drama from director sydney pollack. soapy plot revolves around adulterous couple perishing in a plane wreck, leaving their spouses to find eachother and connect on their own intimate level. romance-novel writing gets sluggish treatment, although i thought the performances by leads harrison ford and kristen scott-thomas were fine. slick production holds interest, even though the plot keeps covering the same ground, and never builds any emotional momentum. as a result, the climax in the airport is a big 'so what?'

did you ever see the film "marathon man"? the part with the dentist? i would rather have that happen to me than to sit through "random hearts" again. it wasn't simply uninteresting, or uneventful-- it was horribly, painfully, and agonizingly boring. at one point, i momentarily lost conciousness. to the average layman, i may have appeared to be sleeping, but the other movie patrons knowingly realized i actually blacked out from the bordom. i thought i was going to die. when the film finally ended (i think it was twelve hours long, but i'm not sure), i let out an exhasperated "thank you jesus, it's over!!", to which all other movie goers cheered. if i had to listen to harrison ford drone on one more second in that monotoned whine, i would have been forced to search for something sharp to jam in my eye to divert my attention. this is 136 minutes of my life i will never get back.

a friend gave me this movie because she liked it. i decided i would finally watch it. it was sooooooo long. i kept waiting for the suspense to happen but it never did. i kept waiting for something to happen after the opening scenes, and it never did. i stopped the movie and came back later. i actually forced myself to watch the rest of it hoping it would get better. it got worse. i kept asking myself, who are these people? do they have feelings? are they just robots? i'm glad i didn't pay to see it or pay to rent it. the end would have been better if dutch died from the gunshot wound. at least we would have gotten some emotion from the audience. or maybe not.

james cagney plays richard gargan (nicknamed "patsy"!), a former gangster now overseeing the surly lads as the new superintendent of a state-run reform school. tepid genre entry wherein cagney's the whole show; he dominates the picture, but only because there's not much else of interest going on. jimmy gives just what's expected from his hard-boiled persona, which can be satisfying if you're in for a quick fix. the direction (by archie mayo, though michael curtiz was said to have helped) is straightforward without being particularly gripping, although the narrative slips in the second-half, grinding the film down to a messy conclusion (with even cagney's patsy getting lost in the shuffle). remade in 1938 as "crime school" and again in 1939 as "hell's kitchen". ** from ****

the stranger jack (matthew lillard) arrives in the studio of the crook collector of antiques max (vincent d'onofrio) and tells his ambitious companion and specialist in poisons jamie (valeria golino) that he is jack's brother. jamie does not buy his story, dominates jack and ties him up to a chair. when max arrives, jack proposes us$ 100,000.00 for each one to protect him in a negotiation of the antiques "spanish judges" with a wealthy and dangerous collector. max invites his stupid acquaintance piece (mark boone junior), who comes with his retarded girlfriend that believes she is from mars, to compose the backup team. however, jack double-crosses the collector and then he intrigues jack, jamie and piece.the low budget "spanish judges" is a movie with a reasonable screenplay with an awful conclusion that wastes a good cast. valeria golino is astonishingly beautiful but together with the good actor vincent d'onofrio, they are not able to save the stupid story. further, the scenes that are supposed to be funny unfortunately do not work, and actually they are silly and not funny. my vote is three.title (brazil): "tudo por dinheiro" ("all for money")

michael myers, the deranged, not-so-young-anymore psycho, who seems to get beefier with every appearance, is resurrected by his druid brothers to wreck more menace upon his family members, and any one else who gets in the way. gaps in logic seem to be ignored in favor of a healthy body count. michael, who originally preferred strangulations and kitchen knives, learns to swing an axe and use whatever means necessary to off his victims, and the result is an awful, patchwork, dollar store film virtually unhelped by a few genuinely creepy sequences. donald pleasance, who died shortly after production, seems to have been injected into this story simply so *somebody* could be billed as the star. you won't want to cover your eyes during this one, but you will shake your head at the downward slide of john carpenter's classic creation.

ok, just what the hell is all this supposed to mean??? halloween 6 (let's just call it that, ok?) is, without a doubt, the most confusing film in the series (and from what i've heard, seeing the original "producers cut" doesn't sound like it makes things any less bewildering than the "official" release). what a mess.this isn't a really bad film, as some have said. it has its scary scenes and some rather intense moments - it just doesn't make any sense! don't tell me that michael was "engineered" from the beginning to be evil and kill and destroy, and blah blah blah. it was bad enough when they turned michael into jamie lee curtis' brother (just so they had an excuse to keep her in the second film) - this is too much.it would seem this is another case of the creators of the film trying to be "too smart" by coming up with a new premise that will shock and impress us all. bad move, guys. we're not looking for an explanation of why michael kills, so please don't try and feed us this crap. show me michael looking menacing and killing a bunch of people. show me dr. loomis trying to track him down and, as always, coming up just short. don't waste (what turned out to be) the last performance of donald pleasance by telling me (in the most confusing way possible) that michael was "created" by some cult from hell and that his "seed" will be passed on to another and... oh, brother.halloween 6 has its moments, don't get me wrong, and we all know there have been far worse sequels than this (hellraiser, anyone?) so get what you can out of it (the scene toward the end of the film with michael charging down a deep red corridor is particularly effective) and try to ignore the screwball plot. hopefully one day we can all see the "producer's cut" and maybe get the chance to make (a bit) more sense out of all of this. till then, this will have to do...-ftm

by far this is the worst halloween movie ever made. the acting is bad, except for paul rudd, and donald pleasence. the girl who played kara (forgot her name) was ok, but overall this movie was basically a big letdown. nothing moved the story forward, it lacked substance, and the scares that made halloween and h20 so good. all and all, skip this movie, it's not worth the price of rental.

scanning through the comments, there doesn't appear to be a lot of love for this movie, and it's not very hard to see why, it's rubbish.now, i will start by saying that the finished product was hurt, in any number of ways, by the death of donald pleasance (dr loomis) in post production. this required a re-jigging of the film's conclusion with loomis buying the farm and took away what was supposed to be a double twist at the end with micheal swapping places with mysterious "man in black" and i do not mean johnny cash.now to the story. the fifth movie ended rather unsatisfactorily with micheal myers escaping from jail with the mysterious man in black. it turns out (aggh) that this man knows the origin of micheal's evil and is also a colleague of dr loomis named dr wynn. they also kidnapped jamie lloyd (played by danielle harris in parts 4 and 5 but here played by jc brandy). jamie, pregnant, escapes from dr wynn's lair and so micheal follows her and kills her. but she'd had the kid so now he needs to track the baby down so he can kill his great nephew.we hear some ludicrous explanation to micheal's evil involving gaelic curses down bloodlines and mysterious symbols. a radio show is broadcast from micheal's home town for some reason, which gives micheal some more hapless victims.in the end the movie, just like this review is vague, confusing and directionless with a very anticlimactic ending.some sex scenes and nudity. poor plot, passable effects, with some good run of the mill slasher kills, but severely lacking in motivation. for what was supposed to explain everything, this only stirred up some new questions, made parts 4 and 5 pointless and was a poor way for a great actor in pleasance to end his life and career.

man, the '90's really were an horrible decade for movies. the movies are lacking in a good style and also the storytelling is often lacking.this 6th entry into the long running halloween-series is certainly a bad one. you just never really get into the story because it isn't a very well constructed and build-up movie.it's simply a poorly done film, that also suffers from its imagine-less writing and non-compelling characters that are in it. dr. loomis seems to be in it just for the sake of being in it. it's a real shame that this had to be donald pleasence last film-role. it's nice and also sort of suiting that his last role is in an halloween movie but he definitely deserved to be in a better one.there is never a sense of real danger in the movie and the character of michael myers just never comes across as threatening or scary. perhaps it's because he's featured too prominently throughout the movie, from pretty early on already. he does his usual stuff again but without too much class or originality. also the attempts to uncover myer's past don't really work out, for the main reason that it just doesn't get explained very well. it's obvious that the script went through various re-writes before- and also very possibly during filming. several scenes even got re-shot or added after the first cut turned out to be far from pleasing. the movie more often looks and feels like a made for tv one. this is also due to the lack of some real good gore. as an horror movie it really is lacking in basically everything to make this a good or even original one to watch.so far the worst out of the series!3/10

all ambiguity about michael myers has withered away thanks to this series' chronic habit of arseholing about with its continuity and pulling relatives out of nowhere. this entry introduces the potty angle that he's not just a psycho killer but is actually controlled by runes, which appear as a star constellation every halloween, and a cult is using him to... erm, well, this film is far from coherent and i lost track of the plot after a while. the movie hemorrhages credibility so profusely it doesn't have a drop left by the end. why does michael put one victim's clothes in a washing machine? why does an otherwise empty corridor have a deadly spike sticking out of the wall? does getting electrocuted really make your head explode? and so on. it's left to donald pleasence, in his penultimate film role, to produce some wonderful little moments from the pile of dreadful dialogue he's given.

taste is a subjective thing. two people can watch the same movie with one of them loving it and the other one hating it. as it concerns 'halloween:the curse of michael myers' i fall into the latter category.i'm of the opinion that john carpenter, in 1978, made one of that decade's finest fright films, which despite its flaws, still holds up well into the 21st century. it reused many of the old horror film devices but utilized them in original and effective ways. it had no pretensions that it was anything other than a movie about an escaped mental patient stalking babysitters on halloween night. and yet there were 'ideas' in the film but they were subtly introduced and not hammered into your skull. it juxtaposed the myths of the macabre festival with the reality of what was taking place in the story and it did this with a wonderful ambiguity. the 'filmmakers' of this 'film' probably wouldn't even understand that previous paragraph. that's why we're saddled us with this miserable and inept piece of disposable celluloid. direction, script, acting are of the lowest strata imaginable. this is the type of film that is so mind numbingly dull and nausea inducing as to make you want to crawl back into the womb and die. it is also truly, truly sad to see veteran british actor donald pleasence wasting his acting abilities with this saliva puddle of a movie. he seems drained of all his energy and resigned to the fact that this may be his last film. maybe that's what killed him.

okay wait let me get this street, there are actually some morons on this site who reckon this is one of the better if not the best halloween sequel. i even read someone saying it was just as good as the original. pah what nonsense don't believe them i've watched every halloween and clearly unlike some people knows what makes at the very least a good horror movie and this shower of s is one of the worst horror movies i have ever seen in my life. frankly if i was john carpenter i would sue the person who wrote this either that or go around to his or her place with a hunting rifle. seriously halloween sequels in general are nearly all rubbish, two was crap, three was stupid, four is alright, five is well five, h20 alright, resurrection painful. yet, in many ways i find this to be the worst of a very bad bunch of sequels. why? well let me just embark on some kind of rant not so much a review but a mindless rant on why halloween 6 the cure of michael myers is one of the most abysmal movies i have seen in a very long time. ok where should i start, ah yes the plot oh boy the plot. basically the plot is a heaped together mess containing cults, signs of thor and some other crap. it's just stupid it really is, the film tries to be flashy and intelligent yet, its heaped together in such a horribly made way. why does michael myers got to have a reason for killing people? simple enough explanation micahel likes to kill his relatives that would suffice, but no we have to have a man in black and mysterious cults and signs of thor and utter crap. god its so bad it made me want to cry it really did, the writers have tried to add to the character of myers but have actually managed to do the entire opposite. apart from wearing a mask and a boiler suit < which is a completely different colour by the way, myers just isn't the same guy from the original or even two, heck maybe even four. thats another thing why has myers become a jason voorhes parody? i thought it was meant to be the other way round, yet myers is so similar to jason, all he does is endlessly kill people in gory ways. in the original he teased his victims took his time and as a result the whole thing was far more suspenseful. in this he just walks around hacking people to death. i mean in the space of half an hour we had equalled the amount of kills in the original it was just ridiculous. oh and myers in this seems to have a really big head, i mean its huge and hes put on loads of weight. what else is crap, oh yeah the return of tommy jarvis thats pretty bad, in fact all the characters in this film are crap bar dr loomis of course. i can't stand the little kid, i wish he had got it he's really irritating. our heroin is boring and not interesting. and her whole family are a terrible bunch of actors. the mother is rubbish, the brother is bad and the father i mean was this his first part or something? he was like a cartoon villain for gods sake he was actually more evil than myers < by the way his death is one of the most abysmal i've ever seen i think even friday the 13th wouldn't come up with something so entirely laughable. what else is rubbish oh yeah tommy jarvis, don't know the name of the guy but he really can't act, he tries his best to be serious and all that but i just wanted to laugh at him. i wish he had died in fact if everyone had died it would have been quite good really. there is dr loomis a horribly aged and dieing donald pleasence by all account. despite him being on his last legs pleasance is still the stand out in the brief amount of time he features. its such a pity that such a corner stone of this franchise had to say farewell in garbage like this. what else is rubbish, oh yeah the bit where the radio dj gets it. firstly how the hell did michael manage to get in that van when five minutes ago he was in his house? secondly it was just a pointless kill which may boost the body count but is just another peace of nonsense which adds to the drivel that is this film. its in fact that death which said it all for me in that it was pointless a lot like this film.

after loomis gives a quick recap of micheal myers we flashback to 1989 where jamie is kidnapped by the man in black before the burning police station explodes. micheal returns to haddonfeild once again to find jamie and his baby. in this version the loomis character gets more scenes and seems much more pro-active than he is in the final cut. the score is much better, more in line with parts 4 and 5, none of the electric guitar bs. and the ending makes a tad more sense. for these reasons coupled with the fact that this cut has more characterization and suspense, and cuts back on the gore factor (halloween, unlike say the "friday the 13th" franschise, was never about blatant gore) is why i prefer this bootleg producer's cut. not to say that the cut magically turns a turd into gold, it just polishes the turd a little bit and makes it more comprehensible. the whole cult plot is still very stupid, as is micheal fathering a kid my producer's cut grade: c- my theatrical cut grade: d-

"cover girl" is a lacklustre wwii musical with absolutely nothing memorable about it, save for its signature song, "long ago and far away." this film came out before gene kelly really hit his artistic stride, and while there are evidences of his burgeoning talent here, mostly he plays sidekick to rita hayworth. and there's the problem. rita hayworth is gorgeous, no doubt about that. but she's simply not a compelling screen presence. i've always found myself wanting to like her more than i actually do, and this movie is no exception. she's simply not a very good actress, and she's not even a very good dancer. good looking as she is, there's something vapid about her, and this movie suffers because of it.grade: c-

man i loved ocean's 11.smart movie. all eleven characters were crucial to the heist as each had their own specialised skill that was necessary to pull of the grand finale.what on earth was oceans 12? what was the purpose of the twelfth person? i assume it's supposed to be zeta-jones but she wasn't really a part of the 11 as she was trying to trip them up and working against them the whole film?? it was more like the story of brad and zeta-jones' characters boring relationship with some bits from the original movie thrown in just to get some bums on seats to watch the movie.with o-11, the gang were always a step ahead of benedict (garcia). they were always able to outsmart him. what happened here? he catches up with them after a tip-off and suddenly they're all wusses? the whole movie is so that they can raise the money they stole plus interest to repay back benedict for the heist they pulled on him 3 years earlier. so next movie they're going to develop courage and brains again and get him back for making them pay him back for the first heist? puh-lease...this movie could have been achieved with just brad pitt, zeta-jones and 5 mins of matt damon for the switcheroo scene.slow moving movie, not the energy of the first one. i tried hard to like it and i'm usually very easy to please but i'm really disappointed.spoiler!!! the twist - the whole movie didn't need to have been made as the real heist was done before everything you just saw over the past 2 hours.end spoiler.wait until it comes on tv or if you're a fan of the original from 2001 please don't watch this.

i was watching this movie and getting increasingly bored with the silly plot that was going nowhere, when suddenly, the story takes a surreal turn for the worse and has an actor playing herself. oh how i guffawed. because it's sooooo funny, isn't it? we know julia roberts is playing the character of tess, and here they are, in the film, cracking the joke that the character of tess looks a bit like julia roberts. so julia plays someone impersonating julia. how well she does this, we'll never know, because 99.999% of the audience don't actually know julia roberts personally (and reading about her in hello magazine doesn't count). and then bruce willis turns up! apparently, he's julia roberts' best friend. well, he is in the film... how would i know whether or not bruce willis and julia roberts even know each other? i'm not in the least bit interested in the personal lives of actors - i just pay my money and expect them to do the job they're paid to do. anyway they start cracking jokes about the plot twist in the film where willis (rather unconvincingly) plays a psychiatrist... the one with the little kid in it... you know the one? i don't, i've forgotten what it's called. willis even drops in a comment about how well that film did at the box office - how modest of you mr willis!the problem is that, not only are these scenes pointless and horribly horribly self-indulgent, it also remind us, the viewers, that we're simply watching a bunch of actors strutting around and getting paid vast sums of money for very little effort. you see, when i see a movie, i want to suspend disbelief and forget that i'm watching actors - i want to believe in the story i'm watching. when you start pulling the scenery down, mid- movie, you simply ruin the illusion for me.you know that a tv series has jumped the shark when it starts introducing celebrities, playing themselves (stand up and be counted the simpsons, friends, etc.), but this is the first time i've seen a movie jump the shark. i usually stay away from movies like that (e.g. scary movie, the naked gun, etc.). the trouble is, i honestly never thought the ocean's 11 films would go in this direction. what a shame.so with suspension of disbelief thrown out the window, and the plot now languishing in the movie then cracks the most wicked joke of all on the audience - the heist actually happened way back in the story, and the final 90 minutes or so of the film was pointless posturing. yes, that's right: steven soderwhatsit and his actor friends all get up, point at us the audience and say, "ha haaa... you've all been had... thanks for your money!". then they give us the single fingered salute.well, right back at you. i didn't actually pay to see this movie... i downloaded the dvd for nothing. how d'ya like them apples? now that's a plot twist.

this was the biggest disappointment of a movie...:( sucks, cos i was really looking forward to it.all the twists were crap. they were all flashbacks!!! what makes a good heist movie is the believability of the the job. yes it has to be surprising so the audience is stunned, but if you walk away and go that's bulls#!t... what's the point? plus the main heist was a bag snatch anyway! you didn't get to see the team operating at it's full deceptive and brilliant potential. there was not even one good heist in this movie! they were all rubbish.. including that french idiot's break dancing crap to get through the lasers... it's easy to do that when they are composited in afterwards! plus that kind of stuff has already been done in at least one other movie.. and it was stupid then as well...also, there's no reason to have even half of the 12 or 11 in this movie! what difference do half of the cast really make to the outcome of this movie??? half the scenes don't even need to be there! the first one was classy. this was cheap! and it makes the whole team loose credibility. especially ocean himself for bowing down the bennett.

i had read the newspaper reviews of this film and i must say my expectations were very low before watching ocean's 12. i really enjoyed the first movie but this successor is one of the worst movies ever. i would rate it top 5 of the worst movie i have ever seen. why do i say that? first of all there is a story so thin that britney spears crossroads looks like the perfect action thriller. the fragments that could be assigned the term "story" is loosely held together at times but most of the time the movie just moves along with no purpose or drive. the entire story seems forced and the script surrounding the story is even more forced that it become farce at times.the actors show up but doesn't do anything to deserve any credit or appraise. most embarrassing are leading ladies (roberts and zeta-jones) that either overplay or are extremely plain. damon, clooney and pitt aren't brilliant either. to be honest i really don't understand how they would want to be associated with something as bad as this movie.=== may contains spoilers ==== camera and editing, sigh where should i begin. there are many unnecessary camera movements that just make the experience painful. combine that with extremely untactful editing and you start looking for a wooden spoon to carve your heart out. especially the scene where the entire gang is moved out of the prison to be transported away by car. the camera zoom to each person just get boring and when you are at number 3 of 12 you got the message: wow you are cool and can do simple zoom effects - not. i understand that the scene with tess ocean (julia roberts) playing julia roberts is supposed to be funny but it just gets extremely embarrassing and you turn away to avoid experiencing the mess. bruce willis. why? please explain it to me! why???to summarize ... if you have to choose between root canal work and watching ocean's 12 i recommend the former. make sure they do all the teeth while you are at it ...

rita hayworth plays a brooklyn nightclub dancer named rusty who specializes in cheesecake chorus revues; she manages to get herself on the cover of a national fashion magazine, but her impending success as a solo (with romantic offers all around) has smitten boss gene kelly chomping at the bit. terribly tired piece of technicolor cotton candy, with unmemorable musical sketches (the two worst of which are irrelevant flashbacks to the 1890s, with hayworth portraying her own grandmother). kelly, as always, dances well but acts with false sincerity; when he's serious, he's insufferable, and the rest of the time he's flying on adrenaline. the script is a lead weight, not even giving supporting players phil silvers and eve arden any good lines. *1/2 from ****

ocean's 12 starts off on annoying and gets worse from there on. like a celebrity awards presentation, each major actor/actress is introduced in short 60-second scenarios that seem to stop just short having a blinking "applaud now" sign. the first 60 minutes of the film are incredibly disjointed, poorly edited, and at times, utterly unrelated to the story and confusing. speaking of the story,...there is one, kinda,...but its barely visible for all the "look at me" shots and cameos. only matt damon seemed to actually "act" during this film...the rest of the cast appeared to only be there to participate in a rat-pack-wanna-be session. as for the heist, the action, the drama....it was put into the last 8-10 minutes of the movie and was pathetic and anticlimactic. horrible! horrible! horrible!

i felt compelled to write about this movie after i joined imdb because i thought it was the worst script writing i have seen in a while.the acting/direction/other-areas of the movie are fantastic. i love brad pitt with george clooney. it works. the witty banter was still there too from the first movie. my question is how in the world did they let this script out of the drafting process? i thought that not only did the plot develop like a slug racing to the end of the sidewalk, but that twist? (can i call it that) was so incredibly stupid that i wanted to go demand a refund from the ticket booth. i have never felt so played and used from a movie in my entire life. here i was expecting something similar to the first movie (good chemistry, good acting, good direction, amazing plot) only to find that they had taking my 8 dollars and made a mockery out of it.the part that gets me still is that this movie has now grossed more than 125 million dollars.in summary, i felt that this movie insulted my intelligence. i still feel like the only part the writers concentrated on was that little bit with julia roberts acting like julia roberts. this movie made me sad and angry.

terry benedict (andy garcia) catches up with danny ocean and his team and demands that they repay the money that they stole from him (in oceans 11) plus interest. he holds back from violent action however as he is under the instruction of the world's greatest thief, the night fox. the team then have to pull off a series of heists to pay benedict back whilst testing their abilities against the night fox who wishes to maintain his position as the greatest thief ever. put simply, this film is a complete mess. the masses may argue that it is "cool" and that clooney and pitt put in great performances but these are the same people who have a subscription to "hello" magazine and think that david beckham has the potential to be a great actor. the story is convoluted, it is not complex or clever and it does not have intelligent twists and turns, it is just a complete mess that spills out in multiple directions with the hope that the audience will think it is cool and intelligent (hello magazine readers). any respectable movie watcher will however see the film for the farce that it is. whilst oceans 11 wasn't a great film it had a decent pace, was stylish and had some decent twists and turns. this movie loses its way very quickly and then basically gives up. it is as if the director and cast said to themselves, hey this isn't really working out, lets just have a laugh! indeed the cast looks like they are enjoying themselves but i was not. i will not delve into the plot as its confused evolution does not warrant any examination. the addition of catherine zeta jones is largely annoying. the scenes where julia roberts impersonates herself (with bruce willis undertaking a cameo role) whilst mildly amusing appear to be a desperate move to keep the audience interested. the movie is so full of plot holes that it as if arnie has emptied an uzi 9mm into the film studio. credit can only be given to some scenes where the night fox uses caopeira to undertake a heist against the back drop of some funky music but this is hardly justification to watch the movie. the final scene features the team in a nonsensical drunken stupor; this accurately sums up the movie. stick with the original.

like 'singin' in the rain', 'cover girl' has a trio of two guys and a girl. in 'cover girl', phil silvers (genius) is the comic relief. he corresponds to donald o'connor's funny man part in 'singin in the rain'. in cover girl, gene kelly's love interest is rita hayworth and in 'rain', it's debbie reynolds. that's where the comparison ends.whereas "singin' in the rain' is a classic american movie musical, 'cover girl' is mediocrity incarnate. the story isn't very complicated. rusty parker (rita hayworth) is a dancer in danny macguire's low-rent nightclub in brooklyn. rusty decides to enter a cover girl contest sponsored by a wealthy publisher, john coudair, who made an unsuccessful play for rusty's grandmother years ago. coudair introduces rusty to broadway producer noel wheaton who makes her into a star. danny feels slighted when rusty starts showing up late for rehearsals at the nightclub and decides to close the club down and go on the road entertaining the troops along with his sidekick, genius. at the last minute, with rusty at the altar with noel, she realizes the error of her ways and runs back to danny. they live happily ever after.gene kelly has the least developed part in the movie. all we find out about him is that he owns a nightclub and is madly in love with rusty. coudair and wheaton act like besotted teenagers toward rusty and phil silvers delivers some thoroughly goofy but unfunny shtick. the most interesting aspect of rita hayworth's performance is the scene in which she gets drunk. this foreshadows what happened to her in real life. anyone who has read her biography will learn that she disliked hollywood, pined away for a normal home life which she could never attain but eventually began drinking and ended up with full-blown alzheimer's during the last years of her life.almost all of the songs in cover girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful. gene kelly has only one really excellent dance number and that's the scene where he dances with his 'alter ego'. earlier, the trio has another number which is a pale precursor of 'make em laugh' from 'singin' in the rain'.the most annoying thing about 'cover girl' is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal. a couple of decades later, raquel welch had the same problem. both actresses later in their careers would always try and find scripts that showcased their acting abilities. they wanted to be known as 'actresses' and not 'pinup girls'. unfortunately, 'cover girl' is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain.

i heard the stories of the ravers in the movie and thats great but that is only 1/100 of the movie. the problem with this movie is the cheesiness. i never really got the plot or why the guy was stealing girls. that makes no sense but hey...why they were in a club randomly was curious also. many parts of this movie make no sense but overall i was interested. it was confusing on many levels...maybe i am just not indie enough for this movie but judging from the b looking end scene they ran out of money, just cut some stuff in, and forgot about the plot. its low budget and appears so. i like the fact that they used little special effects which were bad, but they used none that were quality. i would say this film is the quintessential bad script, with alright production. it is definitely not as random as many movies i have seen but the pieces of the puzzle just don't make sense together. in effects, i would give exception to the final battle when all the effects went 1950's on my ass. sparks out of models and the like. watch it if you like an unintentional comedy from an action movie. mystery science theater has a candidate.

recap: simon leads a little team of special agents that has specialized in finding and returning missing people, against all possible odds. their latest mission is about the granddaughter of a friend of them. she seems to have been caught in the web of a particularly brutal criminal and everyone that has gone looking for her has gone missing. but now the librarians are on the case.comments: this is pure b-action, through and through. the key phrase for this is unlimited supply. there is unlimited supply of ammunition, they don't have to reload once. there is an unlimited supply of bad guys, so the heroes have something to shoot at. there is an unlimited supply of breasts, many of them bare, in an vain (and as always failed) attempt to distract from the plot holes. and there is an unlimited supply of bad acting (it is almost like erika eleniak's performance shines in this, what about that?), and actors that don't seem to care more than the paycheck (and why should they when no one else seem to?).and as in most b-action movies there are an unlimited supply of bad gunfights. but these almost seem to be of a ridiculously bad kind. i think i saw more realistic gunfights when i played cowboy as a kid.but then again i didn't really expect much either, how could i from a action movie named the librarians? and it actually delivers about what could be expected. 90 minutes of more or less bad action with some scenes to connect the dots between. but i am unsure if i can call it entertaining, it didn't keep my interest very long.3/10

don't get me wrong: i enjoy art-house movies, low-budget flicks, character studies, and foreign movies. unfortunately, i couldn't enjoy this one -- glacial pacing, complete lack of plot, and characters that you can't dislike enough to hate, but you can't tolerate enough to like.for me, distant was like watching the cutting-room floor footage of a reality show -- all of the scenes which were deemed too uninteresting which would normally not make the final cut, were the only scenes included. a camera in my apartment with two of my friends ambling around for hours does not an interesting movie make.distant certainly makes the watcher feel that way -- long stretches of no dialogue (nearly 10 minutes before the first word is spoken from the credits) can be made to work (2001 comes to mind), but for me, something else compelling needs to happen to draw me in.if you're the kind of watcher who can sit through a movie and be content with movie analysis, perhaps it will work for you. however, if you're somebody who chooses to watch movies to relax, expand your mind, or be entertained, you should probably look elsewhere.

there seem to be many fans of this movie here, but i found it boring, slow, meandering, and pointless. and i watch and enjoy plenty of art-house and independent films, so i wasn't expecting an action movie. i didn't sympathize with either character. the guy from the countryside was a bad guest and didn't seem to be trying very hard to find a job, and his relative in istanbul was humorless and closed off emotionally. in an interview on the dvd, the director says that the movie is about a common situation in turkey - the person leaving in the countryside because there are no jobs and coming to istanbul and staying with relatives while trying to find work. that in itself is interesting, but the movie wasn't.

rita hayworth is just stunning at times and, for me, the only reason to watch this silly film. despite the overdone 1940s lipstick, rita was one of the all-time glamor women of hollywood. in fact, for a couple of years i can't imagine anyone that looked better, except maybe elizabeth taylor in her prime.anyway, the co-star of the show, gene kelly, does not play his normal likable, at least the kind of guy we all know him from in "singin' in the rain." here, kelly's "danny mcguire" pouts much of the time. phil silvers, who i loved on tv at "sgt. bilko," is so stupid in here as "genius" you will just cringe listening to his dumb jokes....and they are stupid.the visuals are good with great technicolor, which almost looks terrific. you get to see a lot of pretty women in here, too, not just hayworth. unfortunately, the story isn't all that much. it centers around hayworth deciding about a career choice. along the way, we get the normal shabby treatment of marriage and we get an insultingly-dumb ending. all in all, an unmemorable film, except as a showcase for hayworth's beauty.

this movie is bad. really bad. so bad it made me want to shoot myself in the forehead. i hated this movie. first off, the plot went absolutely nowhere and anything shocking about this movie was seen in the 30 second teaser trailer. secondly, anyone who saw the original in 1979 knows that it was a bad movie too and completely unworthy of a remake. by far the best part of the movie is the house it takes place in. which is not saying much for the actual movie. there were parts in the movie when the music gets very suspenseful and you're positive someone is around the corner and it turns out to be the maid or the cat, but when someone actually is around the corner it is impossible to be even startled because you've been expecting it all movie. so save yourself the money, save yourself the time, save yourself the headache and just watch the trailer. there is absolutely no point in seeing this movie, not in the theater, not on dvd, not on tv, never.

this starts out interestingly, as there's a carnival right next to someone's house with an oil rig right there too and some kind of store-front church across the street with a neon "jesus saves" sign, all right in one tiny area....now that's pretty dazzling, if improbable...and then we go right into the movie which takes improbable to new levels. of course this is a lame remake of the 1979 thriller starring carol kane as the babysitter jill johnson....now jill is some chick that ran her cell phone minutes up so high her evil parents are punishing her by making her work it off, probably something that the audience this movie targets can identify with. jill is taken to this huge and fancy house on a lake in the middle of nowhere (of course) by her dad to babysit for the mandrakis family. the children are already nestled all snug in their beds when jill arrives, and the housekeeper is still there, huh, she couldn't babysit? of course, despite the remote location one of jill's friends pops by, one whom with which she apparently has issues as in "boyfriend stealing" or something. anyway, of course the alarm in the house goes off for no reason and then calls from someone start coming in, calls from someone that wants to kill her. of course jill calls the cops and since there hasn't been any actual threat on her life they blow her off, but tell her to call back if there's anything else they can do for her. check out the scene with jill calling her friends at the high school bonfire/pep rally or whatever it's supposed to be, it looks like some kind of "burning man" festival, ??!!?? there's all kind of contrived scares in this including the cool cat chester who of course pops up here and there, one of the tiredest "horror movie" clichés there is. i will admit that i dozed off at some point during this, and did i miss anything? hard to tell, or care, really. this is one of those films that makes me wonder how bad the remakes of "amityville horror", "house of wax" or "the fog" could have been. anyway, from reading online reviews, it seems like the folks that were the most scared by this were 12 year old girls, and i can only assume that from statements like "it made me pee-pee my pants". well, one can only hope that this will put an end to hollywood remakes of films that weren't exactly stellar to begin with, but don't bet on it. 2 out of 10 and i'm being overly generous.

once in a great while i will watch a movie that completely surprises me. one that comes out of nowhere to be a bit of rousing entertainment. one that is pure fun from beginning to end. well folks, when a stranger calls is not that movie. it is an unbelievable stupid and far fetched remake of the much better 1979 horror camp classic. our lead heroine jill is forced to babysit after going over her cell phone minutes and is harassed by telephone calls from a mysterious caller. every cliché in the world is used here from the stupid cat-jumping-out-of-a-hidden-spot to the car that won't start to the killer can be anywhere at anytime. this movie is bad...not even bad in a "so bad it's good way" more in a "so bad it's boring way." skip this godawful film and save your movie for something else. you'll thank me later, trust me on this. grade: d-

i'm starting to wonder if all these pg-13 horror movies are just glorified screen tests for young and emerging talent. get a first-time screenwriter, an inexperienced director, a few tv actors looking for their bigscreen break and see what they can do. 'when a stranger calls' is a little better than most such recent offerings, but is still completely by-the-book; riddled with plot holes and genre clichés.the story is unbelievably simplistic. the slim 87 minute running time is heavily padded with inconsequential friends and a pointless cheating boyfriend. the killer is devoid of even the token motivation of jason or michael or even the original movie's killer, and as a result is never particularly frightening. the police behave in such an unbelievably ineffectual and lazy manner as to verge on professional misconduct. simon west brings the same attractive banality to proceedings that he managed with lara croft, but his style of directing is decidedly generic, possessing no indicators of real talent or vision. the performances are routine, dark hallways replace genuine horror, and the scares are of the tired cat-in-the-closet variety.the cinematography and production design, however, are above average for this kind of film. the house is beautifully designed, all dark wood and glassy reflections, and there are a few moments that are of visual interest.though lacking an ounce of dramatic originality, it acts as a reasonably satisfying 'dark house' thriller, and maintains interest longer than most of its ilk.

before stan laurel became the smaller half of the all-time greatest comedy team, he laboured under contract to broncho billy anderson in a series of cheapies, many of which were parodies of major hollywood features. most of laurel's 'parody' films are only mildly funny, and even less funny for modern audiences who haven't seen the original movie which laurel is parodying. fortunately, 'mud and sand' lampoons a movie which is still well known: 'blood and sand', starring rudolph valentino. 'blood and sand' was released only nine weeks before this parody, giving you some idea of how quickly broncho billy's movies were ground out, edited and distributed.various sources (including imdb) state that stan laurel's character in this film is named rhubarb vaselino, with a final 'o'. i've screened a print of 'mud and sand' with the original titles (in hobo type font), so i report that laurel's role is actually cried rhubarb vaseline, with an 'e'. but i agree that 'vaselino' is funnier. laurel copies the elaborate sideburns which valentino wore in 'blood and sand' (he should've made them longer!), and there's a parody of valentino's dressing scene from that movie, which made female movie-goers swoon in 1922. a señorita named carmen in the original film is parodied here as caramel (a girl i'd like to sink my teeth into).this movie (like the original) apparently takes place in spain, yet there's a prohibition gag. laurel uses a distinctive hat-tipping gesture here which could have become a trademark for him (like hardy's distinctive necktie twiddle), but i've never spotted it in any other laurel film. there's some amusing dialogue: rhubarb vaseline tells the other matadors to 'save a bull for me.' when vaseline becomes a successful toreador, a lackey tells him 'the bull is without, sir' ... which is funny, but i was disappointed that laurel didn't reply 'without what?'.there's one funny moment here which almost certainly wasn't planned, when vaseline shows up for the bullfighter auditions. laurel swaggers into the bullring, and -- before you can say 'corrida querida' -- he tosses a bull over the fence, where it lands with a thump near the other auditioners. the bull is obviously a fake, but the gag is funny anyway ... and, aye, there's a title card with a joke about 'throwing the bull'. the serendipitous moment occurs when laurel repeats the gag, and vaseline slings a second bull over the fence. this one lands on its butt, and balances upright for just an instant before toppling. very funny! if somebody planned that gag in this quickie comedy, i salute the unknown gagsmith ... and the tech man who rigged the bull to land in that position. more likely it happened by luck, and the director and editor were smart enough to keep it in.during the silent era, whenever hollywood made a big-budget feature film which was set anyplace where the people don't speak english, it was a common cinematic device to show a piece of text or an inscription in the local lingo, then dissolve to a shot of the same text in english. i was surprised that this low-budget comedy spent the money to copy that device here: we see a notice-board outside the corrida with a message in spanish, then it dissolves to the same text in english. unfortunately, the photography in this cheapo movie is so dark that the effect is wasted.the actresses in this movie are attractive ... including broncho billy's wife leona anderson and stan laurel's common-law wife mae dahlberg; the latter briefly does a pretty dance. (mae had danced in stan's vaudeville act.) i was surprised to spot charlie chaplin's half-brother wheeler dryden in a brief role, since chaplin had nothing to do with this movie. in 'mud and sand', laurel gives a funny performance that's quite unlike his later familiar stanley character ... but this film is much less funny than his brilliant work with oliver hardy. my rating: just 3 out of 10. trivia note: twenty-three years later, in stan laurel's very last american film -- 'the bullfighters' (1945) -- he again played a spanish bullfighter (with his spanish voice post-dubbed). coincidentally, that film used stock footage from 'blood and sand': not valentino's movie, but the tyrone power remake. 'mud and sand' is funnier than 'the bullfighters', but not much.

it hurt to watch this movie, it really did... i wanted to like it, even going in. shot obviously for very little cash, i looked past and told myself to appreciate the inspiration. unfortunately, although i did appreciate the film on that level, the acting and editing was terrible, and the last 25-30 minutes were severe thumb-twiddling territory. a 95 minute film should not drag. the ratings for this one are good so far, but i fear that the friends and family might have had a say in that one. what was with those transitions? dear mr. editor, did you just purchase your first copy of adobe premiere and make it your main goal to use all the goofy transitions that come with that silly program? anyway... some better actors, a little more passion, and some more appealing editing and this makes a decent movie.

you know, i always fancy disturbing or strange movies, especially when they get shown at the fantasy film festival in hamburg, germany. but subconscious cruelty was probably the worst film i saw this year. will this comment contain any spoilers?no, because i just did not understand this movie. but well, what can you expect from a flick that was introduced to a festival crowd "we (the guys from the festival) know that not all of you will watch this one until the very end"...i like splatter movies and i also like movies with a strong graphical language. but this? there are a lot of bloody scenes in this one, but why? what is the director trying to tell us? is he saying that we lost all morality and all religious feelings? or is he saying that incest will always end in a disaster? who knows - i do not.if you want to watch a movie that keeps you thinking for quite some time - watch it. but don´t expect to think "wow, i got the message" - i did not get it...

this film seems well made, and more efforts should be made to promote films by women. that aside, this film is also profoundly disturbing in that it justifies the manipulative and psychotic machinations of a character that is profoundly disturbed. if you've seen any of the promotional material, you might think this is a poignant film about a relationship that's reached its end, but none of that suggests how really disturbing the central premise is:a woman threatens suicide unless her soon to be ex agrees to relive here most treasured memories of their relationship. when told how unfair (to say the least) that such a threat is, tessa (the purported protagonist) suggests that "life's not fair."huh??? this character also uses tears to manipulate her former lover into staying, and coaxes him into sexually oriented behavior (which she initially denies as a motive) all the while assuring him "this isn't sex."reverse the genders, have the leads played by tracey gold and brian austin-green and this could air in feature length on lifetime with a title like "hostage to obsession." there is no medically accepted definition of sound mental and emotional stability that would encompass tessa's behavior in this film.props to kristen thomson for playing a border-line psychotic, manipulative ex to a t, perhaps too well because there is no well-adjusted person, male or female, who could watch this and not have shivers run up their spine.

sorry, but jacqueline hyde (get it??? - jack l and hyde - jekyll & hyde) has some of the worst acting this side of hardcore porn, not to mention a script apparently written by a first-grader with undiagnosed learning disabilities.jackie hyde inherits an old mansion by a grandfather she never knew she had. guess who? yes, an inventor of the special formula that slowly takes over one's body and mind - yes, that mr. hyde! despite some nice skin scenes, this film fails to register any feeling or emotion other than uncontrollable laughter.as much as poor jackie tries she just can't stay away from granddaddy's special formula and the result is an hour and half of wasted time.

jacqueline hyde starts like any other normal day for telemarketing individual jackie hyde (co-producer gabriella hall) until her boss (robert donovan) fires her for taking personal calls at work, however it's not all bad news as the call she took was from a lawyer informing her that her grandfather (malcolm bennett) has recently died & that he left her his mansion & fortune (why doesn't stuff like that ever happen to me? sigh). very excited jackie heads on over there & makes herself right at home, while looking for the thermostat late one night jackie stumbles upon a secret room where her grandfather stashes the bright red formula that he invented that allows whoever drinks it to change their appearance. being a bit on the porky side jackie finally settles on the glamorous jacqueline (blythe metz), however jackie's better looking alter-ego starts to take control...written, co-produced & directed by rolfe kanefsky i thought jacqueline hyde was complete total & utter crap from start to finish & it's as simple & straight forward as that. according to the opening credits jacqueline hyde was 'inspired' by the classic robert louis stevenson novel 'the strange case of dr. jekyll and mr. hyde', frankly if mr. stevenson could see what was being done to his story here he'd turn in his grave. for a start i think jacqueline hyde was/is intended to be a horror film, the imdb certainly lists it as such but there isn't any horror in it at all apart from just how bad it is. i would say that jacqueline hyde is more a soft-core porno than anything else & extremely tame with it, why sit down & watch this softer than soft porno crap when you can watch you proper hard-core stuff that actually delivers the goods? why, that's the question i ask here. it's not even good porn either, besides being far too soft it's dull, boring & the not-worth-mentioning sex scenes are few & far between. the most intelligent aspect of this film is the title which would have been quite clever if not for the fact that another film used the jacqueline hyde (1998) title during the last century & judging by the imdb's plot summary it sounds a hell of a lot better than this piece of rubbish. this is one of those films you have to watch yourself to see just how bad it is but just hope that you never get the opportunity.director kanefsky was obviously working on a low budget but that's not an excuse these days, shot on a digital camcorder the film looks cheap & the few instances of cgi look like they came from a nintendo gameboy, the final 'shocking' twist has probably the worst morph effect i've ever seen & is pretty good for a laugh as is the scene when jackie's breasts grow via more terrible cgi. that's another thing, the film takes itself far too seriously. the subject matter sucks, is far too predictable & makes for a poor film but maybe if the dialogue had been intentionally funny with some dirty porn talk the film might have been more fun to watch, alas it isn't so it isn't. forget about any decent horror, violence or gore as there isn't any apart from a surprisingly bloodless decapitation at the end.technically jacqueline hyde is home made film type stuff, the photography is of the flat hand held point-&-shoot variety, the music, production design & special effects are of a suitably low standard to match the script. the acting was awful, seriously this is bad.jacqueline hyde in my opinion a load of crap, there is not one positive thing about this turgid film that i can think of. any proper film lover will have an almost impossible time trying to find any redeeming value in this crap, definitely one to avoid.

even with it's low budget this movie could have been worth watching if there was a story to tell here. it started out pretty good, and fairly engaging and believable. the actors and characters were interesting although there wasn't much character development. my favorite scene was when they were all eating their rations. some seemed to hate it, and some seemed to think it wasn't too bad. the story starts out very airtight. and then... and then it dipped into a little horror which is usually a death sentence for most sci fi. suddenly no scientific basis for any of the goings on. no real believable end game for the villain? no real explanation of what's going on. generally if a movie has to use the f word for every other word it usually spirals down from there too. i still get offended believe it or not. i often wonder what inspires people to make bad sci fi? isn't there a universe of fantastically good stories out there? don't people feel like they are wasting their time and everyone else's when they put out stuff like this. why do we get so much mediocre sci fi like this? no female actors/characters either? none at all? this had the makings to be another "predator" but alas fell far far short. my final comment - poor editing and finally too low a budget to build a real campfire? what gives? my advice for any low budget sci fi movie production companies out there. make sure you got a good story before you start, and edit out bad special effects - it's better we see nothing than something that looks fake or ridiculously fuzzy.

going to need to take a deep breath for this one...terrible special effects that tried to reach far beyond the limitations of the budget. blatant and unashamed plagiarism of other sci-fi movies (like pitch black). terrible acting. endless slow motion scenes of characters walking aimlessly across sand dunes. meandering dialogue that does nothing to further the story. characters wearing turtle neck sweaters on a desert planet with two suns. a "cargo" ship staffed by a camouflage-wearing crew of gun-toting soldiers (why exactly would you need forest-camouflage in space anyway?). some of the worst casting choices in the history of no-budget film-making - a steroid swollen "captain" who comes across more like a muscle-beach jock than a trustworthy commander, and a "convict" who looks and acts about as dangerous as a bunny rabbit. 70 minutes in length, 35 of which could have been trimmed out if the director had any concept of "compression of time through editing"...i won't go on. suffice it to say that while some components of this awful movie can (and should) be forgiven due to it's low budget; the bad conception, laughable plot holes, and snore-inducing script are unforgivable on *any* budget. the end result is a tedious, dull, waste of time. sorry guys, i hate to be so harsh on an amateur film, but you've no excuse for turning out this kind of work.

i was excited about this movie after reading other reviews. what a disappointment! there are so many ways that this movie is bad. the computer graphics were lacking to say the least. i found the acting stiff and unbelievable. watch the sand as the lost "e-pods" (what an original name!)are found. where did all the tracks come from? i immediately recognized portions similar to other movies, ie alien, pitch black. come on,one huge ship to transport one prisoner? and what is with the prisoner? does he speak, can he speak? i kept waiting for something to tie the bits of the story together, but it never came. if this movie was made on a low budget, it shows. the only part of the movie i liked was when it finally ended. i don't mean that i liked the ending, i didn't. i just liked the fact that it was over. a trip to the dentist would have been more enjoyable. in my opinion. don't waste your time on this one.

it is ok movie if it would be done by high school kids for their friends. it is way below limits be called "professional". there isn't plot, no actors' play and visual looks like you see it through the plastic film. i was so glad that i have ff button on my remote, 32x worked really well. i understand that everyone need to start somewhere, but it shouldn't be reason to bring it to the public. if you have concerns about quality and budget - "open water" was made on $60000 and more than half went to the guy who provided the security in the ocean and trained sharks. and that movie looks 100 times more professional and it was an event in the indy film-making.

this movie is proof you can't just go to a redbox and read descriptions of films and pick one and give it a try.while i'll give 'em great credit for having produced a film with halfway-decent special effects on such a low budget, and at least a halfway decent script and story line... unfortunately, it was only just that: halfway decent.if you like movies where things aren't all neatly wrapped up, and don't mind low-budget effects, you might like this film. honestly, it wasn't really my cup of tea. i should've just gone to bed rather than spend my time watching.for a better science-fiction movie produced on an even lower budget (!) have a look at "primer."

i think its safe to say that if you only really watch box office standard films or any premium production don't bother with this film as you will hate it. if you are an overly critical film buff don't bother either. if you love science fiction films and don't care what capacity you get a glimpse of the future in then you'll be mildly entertained. it is very obvious that the budget for this was super super low but what they have done with the money is worth a pat on the back. some of the burning fire scenes were pretty bad and the evacuation scenes were terrible but it is quite obvious that they had some good support from a computer perspective as the planet scenes and the alien images were quite inventive. the dialog is down right hilarious but acting not altogether poor. as for the story well, i'm not too sure what actually happened at all to tell you the truth.

i think that you can not imagine how these people really work...!! before i came to the studios to watch the guys work there, i actually thought quite the same as you do. but since i saw and did the work the guys on that tv-show have to do, i have to say that they really do deserve respect for what they are doing all day long. that really is no easy work. and also the actors, which in your eyes may be terribly bad, are really great people and a lot of them really can act! i don't think that the material given to them can really show that, as i think this material isn't very good. but they are truly good! so i don't think that you, before you haven't seen these guys doing there work, can judge over them! and i shouldn't have judged over them as well before i met them, but i did and am now terribly ashamed of it. so please, do not allow yourself to judge over these great people unless you haven't seen them doing there job.

i watched this movie only because i was under the impression that i was going to be treated to a cheesy horror flick. i mean, look at the tag line: "they're men turned inside out! and worse... they're still alive!" does that not scream cheesy horror movie to you? and the then there's the title itself-- "screamers." what a perfectly apt title for a horror movie, i thought! unfortunately, i wasn't aware that the real title was, properly translated, "the island of the fishmen."so, about an hour into watching this i realized that this was not a cheesy horror movie at all-- it was a cheesy "adventure" story about slimy fish-men from atlantis. "men turned inside out"? no. there was nothing of the sort. i was grossly disappointed.damn you, misleading taglines! i want those 81 minutes of my life back!

ok by the time you read this i might have stopped crying. this movie was so horrible as to be quite vexing. the creatures are kinda cute, but the only really good thing about the movie was the growing attachment among the prisoners and their guard after getting marooned on this daffy island. even seeing barbara bach with her hair all riffled was no payoff for buying this sterling bit of poop. she goes about with a whispery i've-never-used-my-voice-before breathiness that just don't wash when one is screaming bloody murder. (hey the leading man was cute too but i'm still not assuaged.) this is a cry-into-your-beer ripoff of the good ole island of dr. moreau. poor richard johnson, who was surely born for better things, is just unrelievedly bad as the bad guy. i mean, how bad can a bad guy be? (ask richard johnson). joseph cotten tries hard not to look embarrassed as he staggers through his cameo appearance. in the name of all that's holy, don't rent this darned bomb.

yes, the video cover of this movie made me want to watch this film as a child. it was called "screamers" on this particular cover with the tagline "men turned inside out!". it even featured this warped looking skeleton on the cover as well that made all sorts of cool gory images run through my mind. perhaps some sort of movie about some strange virus that caused a person's flesh to burn off, maybe a movie about undead zombies that are more bloody looking than what you usually get, a science experiment gone incredibly wrong and now strange men with the flesh dripping off their bones go on the rampage. yes, all these thoughts ran through my mind, one that did not was fish guys on some island with virtually no gore and all bore. this movie is really more like the island of dr. moreau than anything else and quite frankly that movie bored me too, it is way to much scientist and not enough killing for my tastes. these films are to much figure stuff out and not enough blood for my tastes. yes i know, i have strange tastes, but i can not help it, i like my horror movies either really bloody or fast moving and exciting this movie is really neither.

maniratnam, who in india, is often compared with prominent world film makers and is regarded a genius in film-making, has yet again proved that he can only make the frames look visually good, without offering much food for thought.forget about pure cinematic pleasure that can be derived from cinema as a very old form of art.while i would not like to claim and portray myself as someone who has seen all the beautiful movies made around the world, still any thoughtful and a bit educated film goer can identify that his films do not contain innovative ingenuous plots, does not contain lingering effects afterward and mostly contain ridiculous ending and a lot of melodrama, seen profusely in indian movies.overall, maniratnam has successfully confirmed my distaste for his films once again.sorry for those who on this board were claiming otherwise. my suggestion to you: watch some beautiful cinemas made around the globe.

it's exactly what the title tells you...an island inhabited by fishmen. shipwrecked doctor claudio cassinelli and crew land on the island, they're either picked off by the fishmen or roped into working for treasure hunting lunatic richard johnson. cassinelli discovers that johnson, who believes he's found the lost city of atlantis, has been keeping disgraced scientist joseph cotten and his daughter barbara bach hostage for 15 years so the fishmen can uncover a treasure trove beneath the sea. cotten, of course, is a complete madman. bach and cassinelli have great chemistry. this insanity was directed by sergio martino and is not, surprisingly, without merit. it's fast paced, reasonably well acted and the fishmen look pretty convincing (though it's unlikely anyone could prove that these things don't look like actual fishmen). there's an excellent music score by luciano michelini.

i saw this movie as part of a billy graham program. the church i attend was part of a community wide outreach to present god and christianity to our community (hartford, ct. usa). i was one of the counselors who helped attendees (who were invited to come forward and make whatever kind of religious profession they wanted...and to follow up on them after the movie. as such, it did what it was supposed to do, and i personally found it to be a medium to strengthen my faith in god.i also found it to be very helpful to those i counseled. i especially like the work of kim darby in this movie. and the parents (the wintons?) were , in a way, a little overdrawn....no one says to their child if they think that he or she may be the parent of an illegitimate child something like the wintons did "oh, no, no, not thaaat." that isn't exactly what they said, but the sympaathetic audience i saw had a laugh at whatever it was they did say, and also at the son's emphatic "no, mom, not me." don berghuis

this version is very painful to watch. all of the acting is very stilted but especially that of norma shearer who is still acting as though she were in a silent movie instead of a talkie. check out the 1937 version with joan crawford, robert montgomery and william powell which is much more entertaining.

i found this early talkie difficult to watch and i'm a norma shearer fan! it's not her fault, but the primitive production values of this film would cause any viewer to become bored. 90% of the movie is filmed with "medium shots," and it's very similar to watching a dull play.

you'd hardly know that a year later mgm put norma shearer in the divorcee which glows with mgm technical know how. how far they came in one year. cheney is a very stagey early talkie. the camera hardly moves. shearer is her usual charming self and rathbone does well in a romantic leading role. they are all very careful to speak clearly and slowly into the microphone source which does mitigate against a naturally flowing dramatic scene, but the play is a sturdy and fun warhorse so one can enjoy oneself if one's expectations are not too high. oh, by the way, the plot involves a ring of upper class jewel thieves who infiltrate themselves into society to prey on their victims. there are some clever twists in the script and true love conquers all. an oscar nom for best screenplay adaptation.

as a physicist, talk about blackholes and cosmology gets my heart racing. however i found this presentation too slow and not packed with enough information for the interested layman (who is most likely to see it). if you have more than a passing curiosity in this sort of stuff, go to the library and check out some books. you will find they explain current scientific cosmologies with far more detail while at the same time filling you with more of a sense of wonder than this movie does. also to set the record straight: hawking is not considered the "greatest mind" or the world's "smartest person" as commonly asserted even among the user reviews here at the imdb. hawking himself has commented that "it is rubbish. it is just media hype. they needed somebody to fill the role model of disabled genius. at least i'm disabled." to be fair, he is probably a genius but among history's greatest scientists, people like einstein, newton, gauss, and many others easily are even more highly regarded. this is not to disrespect hawking who is a undoubtedly a great scientist but rather not to disrespect others who have done even more than he has. anyhow, see the movie if you are truly into science. but if not, i think it would be boring for you.

clifton webb is one of my favorites. however, mister scoutmaster is not one of his best. his patented curmudgeon role seems forced and even unpleasant rather than funny. the film itself is overflowing with mawkish sentimentality. in addition, the viewer is presented with numerous ham-handed references to religious faith and u.s. patriotism that come off as over-reverent rather than genuine. clifton webb does his best with a poor script. edmund gwenn plays yet another jovial clergyman and is given nothing to do. the child actor lead is played by a talentless child who displays a flat affect throughout the entire film. his sole claim to fame as a performer evidently is a bullfrog-like low voice unusual for someone of his age. however, once you've heard it, you've heard it and you don't need to hear it again. unfortunately, he is in the majority of the film's scenes. i find this child so irritating that i fast forward whenever he shows up. since he has a lot of scenes in this film, this means that i fast forward through a lot of the film. there were and are so many talented child actors; it's a pity this film doesn't have any of them in it. still, clifton webb in the traditional broad-brimmed hat and shorts is a sight worth seeing.

i just watched this movie on bravo! and it was absolutely horrible. it has the plot of a shannon tweed movie without the nudity. the premise was interesting enough, a winning lottery ticket in a secluded area and people who have reasons why they want the money. the characters were trite as were the observations on human nature and greed.for a movie called class warfare it had very little to do with class differences other than the first 20 minutes and the predictable ending. this movie could have done a lot better if there had been more characters with motivations to get the ticket and was a "who done it?"the acting wasn't fantastic but it's hard to seem believable with such a terrible script. lindsey mckeon is very cute and i'd like to see what she could do in a better production with a better script. she's probably the only reason why i sat through the whole movie.

the plot: a group of young people with ridiculous names (hutch, swink, phineaus, and october)are brought together by the death of their equally ridiculously named friend loomis. after the funeral, they decide to divide up their late friend's belongings. among them is a video game called stay alive. the group decides there's no better way to show their grief than to all partake in a little virtual bloodshed. but the more they play, the more they realize the connection between the game and the death of poor ol' loomis.the production: this film is just another entry into the latest hollywood craze of low-budget pg-13 horror aimed at cashing in on the junior high school crowd. the direction is sloppy to say the least with quick, music video style cuts that make the action difficult to follow. the dialog is so bad that it actually kills brain cells. the plot itself is so full of holes that we never even learn where the game came from or why those who play it die.the idea behind this film, although not entirely original, had some promise. but the poor execution on both sides of the camera make this one big dud.if you've ever got a craving for a "killing someone in a video game makes them dead in real life" horror film take my advice and skip stay alive for the superior brainscan.

i was not very excited to see this movie in the first place but a group of us decided to go see it on opening night. i felt like getting up and walking out and attempting to get my money back 20 minutes into this film. i felt that the movie was very boring, uninteresting, and not true in many aspects including "gaming". i tried my best not to fall asleep during the movie as i watched one of the worst horror films i have ever seen. the scary movie series was scarier than this movie. the sad attempt to pull in a gothic girl, an overworked business man, and 15 year old geek, and some random guy into a video game that kills you is a bad plot to begin with. then they try to throw in a very horrible love scene where the main character kisses another girl after saving her 10 minutes after his girlfriend was murdered. the theater was packed when the movie started by then end a little over half of the people had left before it was over. if you feel the need to waste only 1 hour and 16 minutes of your time seeing this movie ... prepare to feel cheated.

talk about false advertising! i wasted an hour and twenty five minutes watching this piece of crap and there was not one leisure suit, not one platform shoe, no pointy-finger dancing, and not a single disco ball. i watched it on a saturday night, and ended up with an awful fever, but it had nothing to do with the music.seriously, with or without john travolta, this movie sucked.from the opening scene, you will be asking yourself the question, "where did that rope come from, and will it please hang me, too?" from its unabashed bias against the driving abilities of the pennsylvania dutch, to the shameless promotion of the apparently everlasting capacities of alienware laptop batteries, to the cheap horror effects lifted directly from japanese cinema, this is the worst film to hit theaters since the grudge.

after the mysterious death of an old friend,a group of teenagers find themselves in the possession of stay alive,a horror survival video game based on the gruesome story of erzebet bathory known as the blood countess.the group begins to play the grisly game and soon they are murdered one by one in the same method as the character they played in the game.as the line between the game world and the reality disappears,our heroes must find a way to defeat vicious blood countess. "stay alive" is an incredibly poor teen slasher flick without any iota of suspense.writer-director william brent bell doesn't have the damn clue how to make a watchable horror movie.the jump scares are irritating,the blood/gore level is almost non-existent and the story doesn't make sense.the dialogue is utterly bad and the acting of all involved is embarrassing."stay alive" is easily one of the worst mainstream horror flicks of 2006.stay away from this stinking turd.

a group of young adults open a plain of escape for the spirit of elizabeth bathory when they recite her poem from a video game supposedly representing a séance. the only one who dies in the game is miller(adam goldberg)who also is found dead the same way he perished in said video game. while the others' characters didn't die in the video game, their reciting her poem has instead unleashed the video game into reality with walking cgi characters stalking and killing each of them, one by one. they must follow certain methods using a mirror and nails to defeat bathory and save their skin.if this premise sound stupid, that's because it is. the characters are ho-hum rejects from bad wb television shows, this time allowed to spout profanity. this flick follows the slasher rules, but doesn't show much violence or gore. it stays pg-13 safe with most of the death taking place off-screen. there's a scene where the true hero and heroine are running from video game characters pursuing them. yes, it's that bad. nothing at all to recommend. good-looking cast including sophia bush as the appropriately named october.

in the ring, it was a videotape; a website was the problem in feardotcom; the danger in pulse came from computers; and phone and one missed call featuredyou guessed itdeadly phones. in stay alive, the piece of technology that causes all manner of problems is an online game: those who play it wind up dead soon afterwards. how clever!directed by william brent bell (who?), and featuring an unimpressive cast of twenty-somethings that you might have seen before, but probably can't remember where or what the hell their names are, this is an extremely derivative piece of film-making aimed squarely at the pg-13 horror set; seasoned scary film watchers will no doubt find stay alive extremely tedious, highly predictable and not in the least bit frightening.the poorly developed plot follows a group of gamers with extremely daft names (october, loomis, phineus, hutch, and swink!?!) who attempt to unravel the mystery behind the deadly game before they too become victims. eventually, they discover that it is the evil spirit of the legendary countess elizabeth bathory who is killing anyone who dares to play, and that their only hope of survival is to continue with the game to the end.with a story as dumb as this, viewers should expect a film with loose ends aplenty, not one iota of logic (who made the game, how, and why is never explained), very little in the way of scares or gore, and a dumb closing scene to leave the door open forgod forbida sequel.

bad, bad movie. when i saw the synopsis i was expecting something like ring only with video game instead of tape. nothing of the sorts happened. i'll admit idea is interesting and could be turned into a good movie but this is not it.first of all choosing real life person, countess bathory, is stupid move that adds absolutely nothing to the story. anybody even vaguely familiar with her story would begin to wonder why and how did this hungarian noblewoman end up in this movie. choosing a generic vengeful spirit would be much, much better.then there is whole you-die-in-real-life-as-you-die-in-the-game concept. as i said before interesting, ring-like story. but instead of developing it into good story line it sort of just flows along with no explanation given why did this game became such as it is, why it was created and so on. waste of good idea.and finally this movie doesn't even have gory of funny parts that can if not save at least make crappy horror movies watchable. death scenes are too quick and acting is too wooden to be funny.avoid if possible.

aside from frankie muniz chattering too fast to understand (malcolm in the middle flashbacks?) this film still cannot conjure up a scare. the idea with the "countess" and the history surrounding her placed into the story was fun but the plot, and many side plots, just don't tie together. plot synopsis: murdering ghost lures victims through video game. toss in some blood spatters and a special effects and you've got yourself another bombed out would be horror flick. the ghost cronies resemble the ghost in "the ring two" far too much. the acting and constant and dramatic change in everyone's emotions is unbelievable. save your money.

as you can tell from the other comments, this movie is just about the worst film ever made. let me see how many different words i can use to describe it: boring, unbearable, laughable, lousy, stupid, horrible.....i could go on with such descriptions but you probably get the point.i would have given this a 0, if possible--bad acting, bad directing, bad production, bad plot.this was made in 2001 and it looks more like 1965. very low budget, boring plot, horrible acting, really bad special effects, etc...i rarely ever see a sci-fi film i absolutely think is this bad. i mean this is pure garbage. it has nothing going for it either. as far as a "b-movie" this is the very bottom of the lot.i think i would be more entertained by staring at a blank piece of paper for 90 minutes. junk like this gives good low-budget "b" movies a bad name. this makes ed wood movies look good.the thing about watching direct-to-video movies is, just when you think you've seen the worst, you see something even worse!dj perry is a horrible actor and has no individual characteristics that make him stand out.avoid this waste at all costs! oh the humanity!

this is just the same old crap that is spewed from amateur idiots who have no clue how to make a movie--gee maybe that's why it is a straight-to-video wanna-be movie!i guess it is my fault for actually spending money to see it (one of the worst decisions i have ever made). what a waste. i usually like b movies, some of them are actually quite good--but this is just too ridiculous and stupid to even be funny.the losers that made this junk deserve to be put out of business for wasting everyone's time and money making a movie that obviously doesn't even deserve to be on film! these so-called movie makers have absolutely no talent!stupid plot, horrible acting (especially the drag queens--what sicko would actually find that sexy?!), lame writing (if there even was a script--seems like the kinda bull**** someone just made up on the spot)what is stunning about this movie is its utter lack of anything well-done at all.how much attention to detail would it take to insure that every frame of a film would be so far below any reasonable standards? i don't think it would be possible to make such a bad movie intentionally, and it is inconceivable that sheer bad luck could produce such consistently awful results.anyway, avoid this stink bomb at all costs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

it's tempting to view this film as a daring avant-garde experiment. i like to think that the director was trying to see if it was possible to take all the conventions of comedy film and produce something that was completely, utterly, entirely unfunny.the answer, to judge by "from venus", is a resounding 'yes'. this may not be the worst film i've ever seen, but my brain seems to have repressed all memory of the others. this horrible flick hovers just on the borderline: bad enough that the thought still causes pain, but not quite so bad that my internal censors have obliterated it from my consciousness.it's difficult for me to imagine what the director and the cast thought they were doing when they made this, or why they went ahead and released it once they'd made it. i doubt anyone involved with it earned very much, but surely between them they could have got together enough money to buy up all the prints and have them burned.this is a movie that has nothing whatsoever to recommend it. it's not even enjoyably bad. it's just a non-movie in which nothing interesting happens. i gave serious thought to taking it back and demanding my money back, which is not something i've ever done before.don't even think about renting (much less buying!) this horrible non-movie!

words cannot express how poor this film is.there is no plot, the acting is appalling, basically the whole film is a joke.with a running time of 97 minutes, it's about 96 minutes too long.it might have been ok as a short sketch on a comedy show, but the premise is way too flimsy to work for that amount of time without boredom kicking in.avoid this one, go rent a good movie instead!

this movie was so stupid i couldn't believe what i was seeing as i was watching it, it was like a huge train wreck -- i couldn't look away because it was just so horribly awful! i can honestly say i've never seen anything this bad in my whole entire life. it was so cheesy and the acting was just so deplorable that i just kept thinking "this just has to be some kind of a joke, right? nobody would actually make a movie this crappy on purpose, right?" i really hope this is all just a bad joke and these people don't actually expect people to watch this with a straight face, and i really hope the people who were in this movie were doing terrible acting on purpose and don't actually believe that they are good actors?! the drag queens are pretty funny to watch, though, and so are the cheesy special effects straight out of a bad 80's sci-fi movie.only watch this if you've already seen every other movie in existence first and there is nothing left to watch at all! i would give this a "0" if it were possible.

to have to actually own up to making such a horrible movie! actually, i'm more embarrassed that i sat through the whole thing. it looks like an old 80's sci-fi movie complete with super-fake looking "special effects", queer imagery, and very cheesy dialogue. maybe that's the way they wanted it to look, maybe they think it's cool to do movies in 80's fashion like it will come back in style. who knows...if you think the promised eye-candy will save the film, you're in for a disappointment--the so-called "babes" are manish and downright ugly. they can't act at all, i don't understand why they couldn't at least get good looking chicks if they want babes with no talent! but i guess when you're making a film this stupid, you don't get very good choices, hot chicks aren't just lining up to do this kind of pitiful crap!

if you want to see how to ruin a film, study this one very closely. in fact, it is so bad that people should buy it for that reason alone. especially note how most of the scenes look as if they were knocked up in about 5 minutes. realism escapes this movie on every level. the overall impression is that someone was given a below average script, wannabe actors, an average director and absolutely no budget whatsoever. with a formula like that, it just had to be doomed.i rented this once, and i swear i got stupider watching it. if you are a humanitarian, buy this horrible, horrible movie, and burn it-unwatched- as a favor to the world. it has no discernible plot, bad acting, and then tosses in something about evil ugly women just to really cap the whole thing off. i would suggest watching paint dry before this stupid waste of a tape! seriously. the paint would be better. i wish i could give this negative 10 stars.

oh mr. carell! how far you've fallen! after a glowing moment in little miss sunshine, steve carell's choice of films is beginning to contrast starkly with what has come since. although the 40 year old virgin was entertaining, it was dwarfed by his "sunshine" character. hoping to find something that'd get me to spew popcorn from my nose, i decided to rent evan almighty and see what possible guffaws might await me here. not much...given the trite and clichéd script, the entire film felt forced and unemotional. poking a bit of fun at flagging family values and the current u.s. administration's take on the environment, evan almighty also tries to put a profound biblical moment into humorous terms but fails miserably.nearly every person on earth knows the story of noah and the ark. god's wrath was sent down with 30 days and nights of rain which flooded the entire planet while noah, his family, and two of each of his creatures on earth rode out the wetness in relative comfort via the gopher wood ark. it was a huge moment in human history (if you believe the biblical text).so why would god appear to one man and ask him to build an ark that would only carry the world's animals for a few minutes after a dam break? the simple answer is that he never would. too much emphasis was given to u.s. government policy and not enough on world events, making evan almighty a terribly myopic and ameri-centric film. although designed as a comedy, it really never reaches anything approaching belly laughs. maybe a few grunts and a smile, but little else.john goodman (cars) pulls in another forced performance as the despicable congressman chuck long who's only goals are to create development opportunities on protected national land holdings. even the strong presence of morgan freeman (10 items of less) as god can't help mop up this soaking wet disaster-of-a-film.the only funny moments are between carell and the animals, especially as evan learns what animal magnetism is really like. birds literally flock to him. sheep herd around him. lions take pride in being near him (please forgive the puns).the special effects were fun to watch but were brief (with good reason). the "flood" was interesting in that the ark was obviously guided by his hand and shoved in just the right direction.but other than that you're in for little more than an insult to common sense and intellect.

the only way i can feel good about having handed over these precious minutes of my life is everyday telling someone how awful it was. and even if i say it once a day, every day for the rest of my life i will not fully get my point across. just dumb.there's a difference in movies like this and movies like elephant or fat guy goes nutzoid, two of my other least favorite movies. the latter two were terrible, yes, but that was that. evan almighty takes a strong cast and attempts to kill them all. wanda sykes, jonah hill, john goodman and steve carrell...why god why!? all these people have much better talent, now every time i see any of them i will think of this terrible movie.the only reason i gave this a 2 instead of a 1 was when i saw the movie, there was a mentally challenged elderly woman who thought the barrage of bird poop and getting-hurt-by-tools-while-building jokes were so funny that she didn't stop laughing the entire time, nearly stroking out at several times.

this certainly isn't a comedy - i don't know what it was marketed that way. as a serious movie, it lacks any sort of substance. unless you're fresh out of sunday school or needing your noah fix, you'll find yourself bored to tears.the supporting cast took away from what little of the movie was left. lauren graham plays an empty housewife with no real depth. his children don't really add anything to the movie. they seem to be around solely to brood about their absent father at the beginning. jonah hill plays a creepy internet addict that doesn't come off as humorous. i found the original to be a decent movie. disappointed that this one didn't really go anywhere.

the only redeeming feature of this movie is steve carell. like john wayne, i've never seen steve carell stretch too far as an actor, but it doesn't matter. he always plays his one role perfectly.as marty feldman once said, comedy must have internal consistency. you can have 4 men on stage sitting in garbage cans, and that's fine, but if you bring a fifth man on stage who isn't in a garbage can, you must then explain to the audience why he is not also in a garbage can.why doesn't evan accept his role as a messenger of god? why, when he does accept it, is he so profoundly embarrassed by it? why isn't anyone more impressed with the way that animals follow evan around (they are explained away by the unthinking doubters as "trained animals" possibly from a circus). there's a terrible flood at the end, and most everyone we see hops on the ark and is saved, but surely thousands of people would have been killed by the flood; there is no post-disaster emotional atmosphere at the end. instead, most of congress has finally seen the light and is about to prosecute the lone incorrigibly bad congressman for "profiteering".i gotta admit: i also liked the fish in the aquarium reacting to the presence of evan.

if like me, you enjoyed the first film "bruce almighty", my advice to you is not to get your hopes up too high; in fact disregard any hope you possess for this movie if you are above the age of 12 and have any film-sense at all.without giving too much away, the story sees evan (bruce's nemesis co-anchor from the first film) move home with his family to the virginian suburbs to "change the world" with a new political path. what follows is a rather far-fetched and quite 'silly' storyline, which is obviously set out to target young children as the main target audience. unlike it's predecessor, evan almighty is a family orientated film with the ambiguous genre of 'comedy' tagged upon it's misleading position of 'sequel' to which some would regard a modern-day comedy classic that can be enjoyed by a slightly more mature, upscale audience.generally speaking, evan almighty comprises itself of terrible cinematic values. the acting; omit steve carell and morgan freeman, was rigid and many of the characters were seemingly thrown in to use up the unnecessarily large budget issued for the production. additionally, the cast includes acting legend john goodman who makes an appearance as a heel and is seen just a few times in the movie's entirety; i didn't quite buy the character though and thought the storyline from which he was involved in lacked depth even for a family comedy. every other character in the movie (especially the wife and kids!) deserve a mention for their acting so cheesy it could fill a king-size kiev. be warned though; it is the typical americanized cheddarfest associated with many mainstream family-orientated films, so i'd advise you defend yourself with the nearest grater in sight.it may seem the movie is worthless thus-far, however, it does have -some- promising aspects. the cgi was outstanding and it was clear that a lot of time went into modelling the ark and producing water effects and animation of the computer generated animals towards the end. the particles, renders and textures used were aesthetically stellar. although part of me couldn't help, but think these were undeserving to a movie with such poor ideals and were, in my opinion, 'too good' for this piece of cinema and carried the movie throughout.overall i view this film as a disaster in terms of continuing what was a franchise with huge potential, but unfortunately it fell short to a bad conclusion in the almighty series and approaching the end of the film i had set my expectations high for an epic and somehow meaningful finale to make up for the mediocre content i had so far witnessed. this wasn't the case and i was deeply disappointed and confused come the closing credits. as i sat discontent i couldn't help, but think the movie wasn't anywhere near as 'mighty' as i hoped for. in many ways the film reminded me of a watered down "night at the museum" as it showed similar styling and characteristics, but unfortunately was leagues below even that.i give this movie 3 out of 10, as it is watchable, but it's definitely one to be avoided! if you have to see this film, be prepared for disappointment as 'mildly entertained' is the best you could hope to obtain in watching the said production.

although i'm not too much of a religious person, i still had relatively high hopes for this movie, as it does have the amazing steve carrell, and its prequel, bruce almighty, was actually a creative and clever christian-themed comedy. however, evan almighty comes nowhere near this originality and freshness that the original has, and can't decide whether it's a comedy or a sentimental movie about faith and family values. if it had chosen one clear path of which of these themes to focus on, it could have lived up to its potential, but instead the result of mixing the two is a film that has a very flat and dry sense of humor, cheesy dialogue and motifs that attempt to give the movie profundity, but instead practically insults the intelligence of the audience, and also a very confused and clouded presentation of the movie's opaque message. it was very obvious that evan almighty was very poorly written, there are numerous plot holes and elements in the movie that make absolutely no sense. for example, although a large variety of exotic animals from all over the planet swarm to evan as he builds the ark for their salvation from the flood, is their inclusion really necessary when the only "flood" that happens in the movie is downtown washington d.c. and a suburban neighborhood, meaning they are at no risk of being wiped out? the filmmakers it seems lacked the originality to modernize the bible story whatsoever, and instead just had it take place in a present time without changing anything to the plot, leaving many elements that just don't add up such as this and make it obvious of the idiotic motifs and writing within the movie. overall, this work is tragic in that the acting talent of steve carrell and wanda sykes isn't exhibited because of the bland characters they portray, and that it was so poorly written that it skews and clouts many of the film's attempted themes, and makes a mockery of the first film. finally, evan almighty also is an insult to the brilliant actors in it and any halfway-intelligent moviegoer, in that it fails both of them miserably.

well, i watched this film expecting to be rolling in the aisles ... how wrong i was. the film was moderately amusing, at best, and irritating at worst (the slapstick comedy styling of building an ark with archaic tools, laugh ... no i didn't). i'm very disappointed given steve carrel was the lead. i've watch the office us religiously, cracks me up immensely, i thought 40 year old virgin was good ... but evan 'elp us- why on earth did he accept this script. and, as for morgan freeman- he's old enough to know better.so, the idea seemed reasonable, the actors i had every faith in- but the execution was nothing to write home about and the ending, well it seemed as if they had run out of money, or ideas. this for me was one of the most contrived endings i could have imagined. they took a biblical story and dumbed it down to a cautionary tale on localized environmental issues, not even global issues, but a local bill - yawn!in summary, reasonable start, got gradually worse and, for me, it was all washed out by the time the credit's rolled.

this movie was a failure as a comedy and a film in general. it was a very slow paced movie that seemed to be trying to convey a message, but the message was a cliché, hopeless mess to begin with. this movie falls on shameless environmental point, even making a self-righteous point of destroying an suv and promoting animal planet.in sitting through this, i couldn't help but notice that steve carell got no more than a single truly funny line. the only thing that could hypothetically mark this as a comedy is the pitiful attempt to give comic relief lines to wanda sykes. her character gets frequent, cringe-worthy lines where they absolutely do not fit.far from the brilliance of bruce almighty, evan almighty blows its whole record-breaking budget on special effect plot devices that turn out to barely advance the plot. the movie spends the first half building up to the construction of evan's ark, but by the end, we learn that the ark was completely meaningless, and the whole plot was a just a vessel for the stupid gags and even stupider messages. the movie concludes when we learn that the whole ark, flood, and animal gathering was just a weak political statement by none other than god. yes, god was trying to influence politics.

i very much enjoyed bruce almighty but the minute i found out that there was going to be a sequel without jim carey, i knew it was bad. although steve carell was hysterical in the first film ( the babbling scene is one of my favorites) , and, in my opinion , deserves an emmy for his role in the office , he is pretty weak in this dull comedy. i'm curious how much work the script writers put, because we could just as well do without the story . but even if we discard the huge plot holes (why did elephants and lions come to aid evan when the flood only concerned that particular area of washington) the film is simply ...not funny. i did not laugh once and as far as i remember, a comedy is supposed to make you laugh . or giggle at least. not this one.there is small hope however. evan almighty has "family" written all over it and maybe a family viewing might be enjoyable,(kids might be entertained by the variety of animals and the silly jokes) , but ,for me, evan almighty simply doesn't cut it.i give it a 4/10 and hope that carell will be more careful when choosing his roles in the feature.

the biggest problem with this film is that it's nothing like bruce allmighty. the first film played upon every daydreamer's fantasy of being able to control ones surroundings as one sees fit. evan's experience though is entirely different. he has none of the control that jim carrey fools around with and instead the story centers around the power of belief. now this would have been fine, since the first film was preaching the same message. the problem is that the sequel does it's preaching at the expense of the comic relief. and to add insult to injury it also throws in politics into the plot. you get the distinct feeling that there is a clear message with this film, and it's main objective is not to make you laugh. to sum things up this movie is failed mixture of eddie murhphy's "the distinguished gentleman" and charlton heston's "the ten commandments". i'm not sure if steve carrell is at fault here, you get a sense that it's his character that limits his abilities as a comedian, the former news anchor evan baxter is not supposed to be funny, he's basically an antagonist made into a protagonist which in this case only adds to the confusion of what this movies message is supposed to be about.

this was a flick doomed from its conception. the very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre pg-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a pg-rated family movie. i wasn't the least bit interested. then came the trailer. not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the entire movie; and i'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer. it's like a 3-minute cliff's notes version of the flick. so obviously i wasn't gonna pay to see it, but once it hit dvd, i thought sure, i'll watch it for free. maybe steve carell can save it.nope.i'm still baffled as to why he signed on for this. he must have owed someone a favor. the jokes were all so flat and obvious, and the director obviously asked him to go for very broad comedy style like the original bruce almighty's jim carrey. but it's just not funny. the studio obviously tried to cash in on the success of 40-year-old virgin, complete with several of carell's past co-stars, a reference to the flick on a theater marquee, and another musical closing credits sequence. but even the talented carrell can't save this. his co-stars don't fare much better, with people like morgan freeman, jonah hill, and ed helms just wasted. wanda sykes isn't wasted, she's just a waste in anything she does, and her horrible one-liners and reactions just make you wish people would stop giving her work.the story itself is just predictable and lazy. it pounds you over the head with obvious foreshadowing, like evan's disregard for the environment (drives a gas-guzzling humvee, opts to use wood from endangered trees for his house, hates animals,...), and by the end it's just over-the-top preachy on both faith and the environment.why the movie was made at all is puzzling enough, but i really don't understand how it reportedly became the most expensive comedy ever. the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work i've ever seen. maybe the rental of the live animals on set cost a fortune. who knows. but whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn't translate to quality, that's for sure. but hey, it wasn't the worst film of the year by far. there's still plenty of worse duds like norbit and death proof.

i hated this film. simply put, this film is so bad that i almost want to disregard ever watching it and never again mentioning it. but on the other hand, i can't resist a good bashing. and if there's one thing that evan almighty does for the audience it is that it brings out the best criticism.the film (a sequel to the much funnier bruce almighty) starts out by reintroducing the audience to evan baxter, a mere supporting at best character in the original film. that's right. this film shows no jim carrey or jennifer anisten. not even a small cameo appearance. you know your film is bad when the guy that agreed to do ace venture: when nature calls won't even have a short walk-on role. but somehow they manage to keep morgan freeman as god. while sitting in the near empty theater bored out of my mind at the lack of comedy i couldn't help but wonder how much money it took to secure freeman for this film. then it hit me an hour ago. it's just a throwaway role that takes up all of 20 minutes in the 100 minute film. god just pops up in between scenes to tell evan to build the ark. sure i know morgan freeman won't look at this film in a year and think it's as good as his roles in the shawshank redemption and million dollar baby but it's easy money.where was i? oh yes, the plot. sometimes it's so hard to keep focused on the plot when you realize that you gave more thought thinking about the plot than the writer of the screenplay did. anyway evan (steve carell) has apparently left his job as a news anchorman for a job as a congressman. yeah... with no transition in between. he never turns to his wife and says "i think i want to be a congressman." it just happens within the first five minutes and you are forced to deal with the big transition. well as a congressman he is to partner for a bill proposed by john goodman's character when suddenly god appears to tell evan to build an ark. no "hey, how you doing? how's the weather?" bit. just "i want you to build an ark." evidence of bad writing: evan determines that god is giving him clues to build an ark after noticing a fan hold up a sign saying genesis 6:14 when he's walking past his son whose watching a televised baseball game.that's basically the plot of evan almighty. there are some random supporting cast members that do their best at creating comedy but they don't do very well because they aren't given hardly any screen time. it's just your basic run of the mill family building an ark film. oh and also there's that obligatory scene where a father has to cancel his hiking plans with his kids and wife because he becomes busy with work. they walk off disappointed but they understand, as do all the other times in film this has happened. just once would i love to see the youngest kid turn to his father and kick him in the chins and tell him "you're a real bastard for canceling your plans with us. i'm going to turn emo now." there's also that drama that you'd expect from the father with his family when they realize (the wife, actually... the three kids have no problem helping dad build an ark) that he's gone crazy and he claims god wants him to build a big boat. but don't worry. his family decides to stick with him. oops, i just spoiled the drama.another problem with this film is that there is hardly any good comedy going on. i know the decision was made to rate have this be a pg film to get a bigger crowd reaction but i don't think i'm in the minority when i think that family humor is more than just guys getting kicked in the nuts and animals crapping. maybe i'm wrong and that's what quality family humor has been reduced to. and if it is, please bring me more adult comedies so i won't have to sit through anymore of this crap (pun not intended).the ending is extra cheesy. all of a sudden the film takes a dramatic cgi filled turn that makes me shudder to think how it is a terrible waste of cgi. i bet it was expensive too. finally after all that waiting we are told why god wanted evan to build an ark. and boy oh boy i hated the reason why. i'll spare the details but it was like watching or reading a murder mystery and having the killer turn out to be the person who walked behind the main character for one second and had no lines.oh and then there's a nice touch at the very end. the song "gonna make you sweat (everybody dance now)" plays over the credits and we are then subjected to the "dancing" of the cast. i don't get it. they spend 100 minutes unsuccessfully making a comedy and then they wrap it up with a thriller. i swear i haven't been that scared watching steve carell dance since ... well never. there you have it folks. evan almighty is the scariest film of all time.all in all i thought it was a wasted experience. i'm baffled at all the talented actors (carell, freeman and goodman) appearing in this bore-fest alongside lauren graham, the woman from gilmore girls that has yet to prove to me that she can act her way out of a paper bag. but most of all i'm surprised at my will power to actually sit through the whole film without walking out.rating: * out of ****

'a comedy of biblical proportions!' those masters of hyperbole, the movie-tag-line-writers, at it again; the sequel to 2003's bruce almighty, raises barely a chuckle. the only thing which raises my interest in this movie above total indifference is its dogmatic christian undertones. sorry, make that overtones.steve carrel, ignoring jim carrey's good sense to decline a role reprisal, plays evan baxter, the smug news anchor from bruce almighty, who has just been elected to congress. with a new life in virginia and the stress of moving into a house the size of the acropolis, the pressure of all the change takes its toll on his family. his wife (lauren graham), evidently airlifted in from stepford, and three sons (jimmy bennett, graham phillips and johnny simmons), who do a stilted job of looking sad to a piano accompaniment, pray for the family to become closer, and almost out of guilt, so does evan.in what must be the greatest shock of all time, god (morgan freeman) actually shows up, but does the whole pesky 'working in mysterious ways' thing all over the place by telling evan to build a noah-esquire ark in preparation for a great flood instead of just giving him a pool table or and x-box or something. and in true mischievous deity style, he also forces evan to grow a beard, long hair and wear worn and tatty robes. now, back in the day i'm sure razors were hard to come by so the beard was somewhat of an inevitability for noah, but i'm almost certain it had nothing to do with spirituality. same with the robes; a massive construction job is surely made all the more difficult by such impractical clothing. couldn't god have conjured up a pair of steel toed boots and a hard hat for the poor guy? apparently not.to paraphrase bill hicks, i find the idea that god is messing with us somewhat unsettling, and so does evan who fights him every step of the way. and who wouldn't? god essentially gets him fired, drives away his loved ones, makes him a laughing stock and at one point actually threatens him. of course god turns out to be right, and the rational, hard working family man who was getting on fine by himself is forced to eat a large slice of bittersweet humble pie. it's almost as if to be left alone by god, evan had to tolerate and humour him. what kind of message is that? evan almighty does have a highly commendable environmental slant, with the underlying theme being that the federal government is blind to the damage being done to the world around us. it is also the first film ever to offset its carbon emissions and this should surely be considered a landmark achievement by a hollywood studio. were it not for the trite, condescending banner of american christianity flying high above it, evan almighty could have been an inoffensive family movie, with a praiseworthy environmental record. but with its confused religious dogma and relentless 'blind faith' message, it ranks as one of the most repugnant movies of all time.

well, for this abomination of a film, i wasn't expecting anything good. i find steve carell annoying, and bruce almighty was pretty good but there is absolutely no reason for it to have a sequel. somehow, this film was even lower than my expectations, even when i didn't have any. does anyone remember the disney movie noah with tony danza? well, let's just say that evan almighty completely ripped it off in way too many ways for the movie to remain justifiable. actually evan almighty was had the exact same plot outline as noah, with the exception of a few technicalities, it was nothing but a carbon copy of a far-superior movie that was actually funny. another thing, did anyone get sick of wanda sykes' stupid, unfunny, redundant, one-liners that were literally in every single scene? it was completely ridiculous and just dragged the movie down more and more. despite the fact that i basically had already seen the film ten years earlier(noah), evan almighty has to be the most predictable movie i've ever seen. i figured out the entire movie from beginning to end within the first five minutes and eventually realized that it was ripping off noah left and right. in conclusion, if you're a little bit unsure of whether or not you want to see evan almighty, and are already sick of jonah hill playing the same role in every single movie he's in, liked bruce almighty, and don't want to see a predictable, dry, unfunny movie with steve carell trying to act like jim carrey, then please, don't see this piece of garbage.

one hundred and seventy five million dollars is a hell of a lot of money to spend on even the biggest summer blockbuster. not even michael bay had a budget that big for transformers, so exactly how universal pictures spent that much cash making evan almighty is a mystery. they certainly didn't spend it on the script for one thing as the film is not so much a classic comedy as it is christian flag waving and bar one or two quiet chuckles, you're most likely to spend the duration wondering where the budget went or why steve carrell felt the need to slum it in a decidedly average movie at the exact moment when his star profile has begun to rise.a sequel to the jim carrey comedy bruce almighty, this film sees former supporting character evan baxter (carrell) moving up the ladder into the main player slot. the story opens with him leaving the news desk to become a public official and moving to washington with his wife and three generic sons (slightly weird primary school moppet, spirited middle schooler and sulky teenager). evan's bid to change the world through politics however gets a spanner in the works when god (morgan freeman) appears and asks him to build an ark.in other words, it's an updating of the old genesis story, with evan fighting off cynicism and naysayers to build the immense boat. unfortunately, while the premise is reasonably promising, it sadly does not provide many laughs. there's a bit of fun to be had in the early going where evan's straight-laced mp tries to juggle the demands of public service with the unwelcome packs of animals that follow him around and a beard that resists all attempts to shave it, but as soon as he accepts his divine mission, the film takes a nosedive.from this point on, it turns into a message movie. evan begins preaching with alarming regularity and morgan freeman keeps turning up to offer kind wisdom, while gently prodding his chosen in the right direction. without evan's resistance though, the only trace of comedy left comes in the form of a few rubbish animal-feces jokes and john michael higgin's role as evan's exasperated right-hand man. higgins may show the same rich comic potential that he did previously in arrested development, but his enthusiasm cannot save the sinking vessel, especially seeing as carrell has all but placed his formidable improv skills on the back-burner.in some respects, it's slightly similar to the passion of the christ, but unlike mel gibson's movie which encouraged everyone to believe in god through blood letting and guilt tripping, evan almighty tries a more gentle approach. the movie simply tells us that we should have faith in god, because he has faith in us. unfortunately, this movie is just as likely to make you laugh as the passion is. carrell is on autopilot, the jokes don't exist and wanda sykes makes a bid to become the most annoying person on the planet. it might be sweet, but somebody just tossed $175 000 000 overboard.

although i enjoy steve carrell's work, evan the almighty, like so many other overdone films turned out to be a lot worse than i hoped it would be.this turned out to be a cheesy family movie, the kind that employ famous comedian to improve their image, but ultimately fail to deliver.the usual carell's dorky humour is almost absent from the movie and though he did make me chuckle a few times, there was nothing hilarious about him in evan the almighty.his 3 kids, although were probably somehow important for a biblical character, were really quite useless in the movie and terrible actors. even his wife, was somewhat of a third leg for such a simple storyline.spending so much money on making a comedy was a huge mistake. although, carell's career might profit from this movie, there's no real reason to go see it.if only there was a little less of his family, a little more of carell, molly shannon and maybe some other snl cast, it could have actually been a lot more entertaining.4/10 for a few chuckles here and there.

this picture is a bad and blown up rip off of the michael pohl short film extinct from 1995. while michael pohl's idea was original and perfect for a short film setting, a sound of thunder's plot was poorly adapted from pohl's story and not fit for a full length feature film one would expect from a major hollywod studio. the tragic flooding situation that ruined the sets in prague was just one bad link in a long rusty film production chain in this case. for a studio to release such a product... it is a shame. especially for warner brothers, a studio which broke new effects grounds with shows like babylon 5 in 1993. on television. visual effects for television shows pioneering cgi in episodic television in the mid nineties were way more sophisticated than what is brought to the screen in this picture. in cases like this, sad as it may be: can the film.

this is a pitiful movie. what makes it even more pitiful is the time, effort and money put into a super predictable script and action.it's about some kind of monsters, by the way, and some kind of insects. don't expect an explanation of the plot. there is none. that might work, if there was something of interest, or characters we could care about. there isn't. everything that happens to any person is as predictable as the other movies sci fi channel does.don't try to understand what some of the characters are saying. they speak gibberish, especially the annoying lead woman, whose accent is a sort of thick british that is harder to understand than any old british movie you may have seen. she's unintelligible.a lot of money is spent on some great sets and scenery, and that is the major crime of this movie, because it just isn't worth it.

what could have been a good story was destroyed by the ludicrous time travel scenario. if something was altered in the past that changed evolution and humans never developed, the time machine would never have been built. if something from the past was brought into the present, it would have no effect on the past.i really wish film producers would run their ideas past an actual scientist before finishing the script. even if you suspend reality and assume time travel is possible, you have to stick to logic.otoh, ben kingsley seemed to be having a great time with his over the top performance. all of the other actors seemed to be doing the best they could as well. it was the writing that left them twisting in the wind."back to the future" handled it better.

i was initially excited about this movie and fully expected it to be a combination of equilibruim and farenheit 451. unfortunately, i was continually disappointed in the lack of depth and interest of the plot and subplots. midway through the movie, i divulged into poking fun at the characters and sets to avoid having to turn it off. i did enjoy the premise of a future with merged cultures and separation of the have's and have nots. what could have been an artful and intelligent look at the future is morphed into a plodding, semantic scifi channel midnight flick with horrible acting, cheap sets and a final gratuitous shot of tim robbins vagina. maybe he should stick to his socialist political ranting - it has all been downhill since shawshank.

this movie was released in all major cinemas in australia. i watched the movie on the weekend of 7th aug and i thought is was absolute nonsense (and i am using that word extremely litely). how it got released to every major cinema no idea. the plot seemed simple enough about the world being divided into subclasses and people needed identity cards and the actor tim robbins playing an investigator who goes to shanghai to investigate a employee stealing id cards, which turns out to be the actress samantha morton.you think from that summary the rest of the story should intertyne but it doesn't it just confuses the audience even more with different storyline that don't relate.if you thinking of seeing this movie let me save u the trouble do not get this movie.

i found code 46 very disappointing. i thought the concept was good and therefore had great potential as a movie but found that it didn't deliver. code 46 lacked thought and structure and the storyline didn't flow well. i thought that tim robbins character wasn't well developed, for eg. i thought there should have been more info and thought put into his family life and not have it completely ignored as i felt it was. when they were first in violation of a code 46 it was suggested that they were not to know that they may have been genetically linked but all the technology was available to them, he took her fingerprint and therefore genetic details when he was investigating the fraud. i constantly found myself waiting for something to happen and the story line to develop and yet it never did. i felt that the film had great potential to be intellectually stimulating but turned out to be the opposite. code 46 tried to be too clever and in the end just ended up lacking imagination.i would not recommend this film to anybody, the only good thing about the film was that it was relatively short.

interesting concept that just doesn't make it. i watched the whole movie, but had to read imdb comments to find out what code 46 meant. if/when it was explained in the film, i must have been in a coma, or possibly brain-dead by then. i only watched it for tim robbins. the fact that i did not know any of the other actors should have been a tip-off. we all have to start somewhere, but this film should not be it. as to the 'anti empathy virus virus'-holy utility belt, batman! where were the joker, the riddler, etc? also, why are the women all so damned ugly? if i want to see less-than-plain stick-figures, i'll just walk down the street. the best part of the film was the car crash. it was totally believable, and not over-the-top like most movie crashes.

bad dialog, slow story, scenes that drag on and are absolutely pointless. i can't believe this much money was invested in such a poorly written film. the directing and acting couldn't save this bomb either.50% through the movie and you're still waiting for it to start. they lay the foundation with the opening preface and then spend the next 40 minutes setting up nothing. you watch 40 minutes of footage that is absolutely directionless in an attempt to do what, i have no idea.much of this film is like watching a really bad french movie where nothing ever happens and the characters are just sort of dull, lifeless and egocentrics living without purpose or care.avoid this film at all cost. anyone that recommends it is setting you up for disappointment and you will undoubtedly question their taste and depth.

code 46 is one of those scifi movies where the government controls who you are allowed to love, and in fact will punish you if you try to procreate with the wrong person. the haves and the have-nots live in completely separate territories, the powers that be can remove your memories, etc. we've seen this stuff before, but that's ok- no movie is 100% original. this kind of premise is always fun to contemplate. unfortunately, just imagining such a future is more interesting than actually watching code 46. the characters are boring and rarely say anything interesting. maybe that's commentary on a dehumanized future, but it's still dull to watch. it's sloooow.at times the imagery is nice, but usually (coupled with its "evocative" soundtrack) just looks like a glorified perfume commercial. code 46 also sometimes uses the kind of television camera-work that i find annoying. you know, two characters talk as the camera artlessly "floats" on one side. two seconds later it's floating on the other side of them in a vain attempt to keep your attention.my friends liked this movie. if they tried to get me to watch it again, i probably would not do so unless they agreed to pay me $50.

apparently i am swimming against the tide of the glowing comments on this film. i have not seen it since i was 4 or 5 years old but there is one thing i remember distinctly...the bunyip was terrifying!!! nightmare inducing terrifying. with the creepy music and the little girl and kangaroo running/hopping away for their lives...as a kid i also remember the animated hobbit... no worries. watership down? didn't blink an eye. dot and the kangaroo? it still haunts my dreams. and i have several friends the same age who also think it was massively creepy. maybe we can get a group rate on therapy.in short: one freaky film for its time.

this movie was horrendous it was sorta like accidentally watching a gay porn waiting for the girls but they just don't come....i waited for almost 2 hours for the damn scarecrows....they just don't come...instead it's just some dumb ass wandering through a dead cornfield with a camera it's a mix of blaire witch and some bad episode of the twilight zone. and the best part is that as of october 23 2005 they started filming a sequel please don't be fooled by the box even though it looks exactly the same as the first dark harvest it's not lions gate bought the rights to the maize:the movie and had the brilliant idea to release it as the sequel to the original dark harvest;which i thought was funny........the only thing they had in common was they were both shot in a cornfield....this movie willllll not scare the crop out of you like the first one so just stay away!!!!!

my friends and i have often joked about movies being in real-time. but this movie really is... they will literally show 4 minutes strait of nothing but a guy digging in the dirt with his hands. it has no-plot, and an incredible amount of gratuitous screaming. i honestly don't believe that it won an award for it's alleged suspense. if you are like me and saw the first film and loved it for it's horrible acting, accidentally hilarious one liners, and all-around low budget"ness", it won't matter; this is so bad it's bad memories might even rub off and taint any good memories you have of the original. you would be more entertained if you were staring at a blank screen.

i really hope the makers of these "movies" read these reviews so that they know that people just dont want their movies. they are just trash and an embarrassment to the killer clown genre of horror. whether or not this was better than the first doesn't matter cause theyre both just plain terrible. i'm surprised they didn't learn their lesson from the first movie. stop now!! warning to horror movie watchers, dont watch, rent or look at the boxes of "urban" horror films, and above all, don't buy them!!!!

suburban kids meet the forest. killjoy is better in this part. he is more wicked and stronger as well. nevertheless, most part of the acting is bad as well, like in the first one. sometimes the characters say things to each other that do not make sense and are not convincing. i made an error to watch this one sober. you'll probably enjoy it more if you are not ;-). if you did not already stop loving clowns after the first movie, you definitely will after the second.....;-)problem kids and their watchers are on their way to a camp in the forest. and what a coincidence, their car broke right in the middle of a forest and.....at night? that's just their luck. they find a house and one got shot, one of the watchers stays behind (why i do not know) and the rest eventually finds another house. in that house a voodoo priestess lives.....but she is not responsible for the resurrection of killjoy. who is it then? well, you better watch the movie and find out for yourselves....

"quintet" is definitely not a film most people would find amusing or even interesting for that matter. there is no scene, dialog, acting or plot development that would light a spark. the icy world is one thing, but muddled plot is something you really can't bear. the characters are not only three-dimensional, they're not even one-dimensional, there is no emotion and there is no sense in anything that goes on. there is a world encased in ice, where nobody is doing any meaningful work, except playing quintet, and the rules to the game are never even hinted. the homes are not heated, even there is electricity, but who and what produces it? there is wood, but there are no animals, except dogs, so where do clothes come from, or shoes for that matter, since, apparently there is no industry, and everybody is dressed as in 16th century europe, which is in odd contrast to not so futuristic pavilion backdrop. the entire movie seams to be stuck inside altman's imagination, and he never bothered to share his ideas or his vision with audience. desolation or hopelessness have nothing to do with lack of appeal to this movie, the world of george lucas's "thx1138" is no brighter place and characters are no more fun, but the story has it's path. in quintet, there is no obvious or even hinted path, and in my opinion it doesn't even provoke thinking about the idea behind it all, as, for example, similar film, john boorman's "zardoz". it's not even done in altman's unique style, so it doesn't appeal to his fans,either, and i'm one of them. all in all, robert altman had a dream, and he woke up without telling anybody what it meant, not even to him.

robert altman's "quintet" is a dreary, gloomy, hard to follow thriller where you finally give up after awhile because it's so complicated.i remember seeing this at my local twin on opening weekend with a full house. by the time the picture ended it was less than a quarter full. never have i witnessed such a mass exodus without there being an emergency to drive people out. that should tell you how bad it is. i believe it to be the worst film ever made involving such major talent in front of and behind the camera.

the earlier review is pretty much on target, which altman was not with this film. i haven't seen it since its original release but i have seldom spent two hours in a theater feeling as miserable and disappointed as i was with this film. if some pretentious community theater attempted a sci-fi version of a ingmar bergman film, it might come off like this. i can't bring myself to give anything altman has made a "1" but this is probably the nadir of a career that has had some remarkable highs and lows. i would have walked out, but as a paid film critic i couldn't. (think about that the next time you envy movie critics.)

this movie was sooooooo sloooow!!! and everything in it was bland, the acting, the plot,etc. it was such a disappointment, since the description looked so good! do not be fooled! this movie is not worth the time it takes to watch it!!!

watching quintet is not unlike watching a group of people playing a word game in portuguese, or some other language you do not understand. you get the idea that they are playing a game, and if you watch closely enough, you may just begin to understand the rules. but, why bother, since it is clear you can't join in and you wouldn't want to if you had the chance.director robert altman is not one to beg an audience to like his films, let alone understand them. sometimes he lets you slip into the picture to be a part of the crowd, like in m*a*s*h, nashville and a wedding, films so full of hubbub and orchestrated chaos, one or two more bodies in the scene wouldn't make much of a difference. and other times, he seems to resent the fact that someone might even be watching his film; as in images or three women, where the stories are almost personal monologues made for an audience of one, altman. with quintet, altman seems to purposely dare anyone to become involved with the narrative. you can't depend on altman to do the logical or the expected, which is sometimes the thing that makes his films so remarkably iconoclastic. but sometimes doing the unexpected isn't daring, just dumb. for instance, in quintet, we are introduced to a young woman who is apparently the last person on earth capable of getting pregnant, and she is, indeed, with child. this last ray of hope in a decaying society is almost immediately extinguished; altman doesn't even wait until the end to play his last depressing card in this elaborate nihilistic and pessimistic tale. he lets us know how empty and meaningless life is right off the bat. brave? maybe. stupid? definitely. devoid of a purpose, he tries to build a story on a rapidly melting iceberg, all the while reminding us how pointless the effort is. for the record, quintet, can at least claim to be prophetic. the story is centered on a treacherous game played by the various bored characters. it is a form of tag (the assassination game): a handful of people target each other for elimination, each as a would-be assassin and each as a would-be victim. two or more can form alliances to kill a third. as they die off, new targets are assigned. whoever lives, wins. all of this happens at some exotic, inhospitable wasteland. it is, to a great extent, an extreme, sci-fi version of "survivor" -- minus the commercial plugs and faked "reality."it is not a bad concept for a sci-fi epic. a post-apocalyptic setting, a microcosm of the world (the cast is pointedly multinational), a game where no on can be trusted or least not for long, and where no one really wins. literally a cold war. a steely eyed director with a taste for dark humor and violent invention could have a field day. the mystery in quintet is not in the game or how it is played, but in why it exists it all. if the game "quintet" is a metaphor for life, then altman, seems to see nothing in the material but a chance to show life to be an empty, meaningless game -- a conclusion as obvious as it is untrue. given the lively, albeit cynical nature of the rest of his diverse films, i don't believe that altman believes in quintet either. and if altman has no faith in his material, why should we?

altman's quintet has to be considered more than just flawed: as so many other reviewers have pointed out, the ideas behind the film, even some of the choices in depicting those ideas, ought to work--and yet very little in this difficult film does. the partially fogged camera lens--i remarked to my wife that it has to be the most distracting directorial conceit i've ever seen--never allowed me to get "into" the film's world.in general there are serious problems with the mise-en-scene employed here. it's clear that no small amount of thought went into factors like costume and production design, but neither is very effective in evoking a believable world. perhaps it is a matter of scale; the film is so stage-bound that i laughed out loud once it was mentioned that "five million" people lived in the city. (yes i understand the constraints of the film's budget. matte paintings here and there might have helped.) in all the most disappointing altman film i've ever seen. great ideas and grand metaphors do not always come through in art--it's just part of the game.

just to save you money and time i will go ahead and tell you that this movie is absolutely not worth the match and gas it would take to burn it. don't waste your time. as a matter-of-fact you would be better off forgetting you ever thought about watching it. i have seriously seen better b movies in a language that i can't understand. who ever gave permission for this to be made needs to be sewed. the only positive thing i can say for this movie is that with a new script and the right director and actors it could be a great story. let me break it down; a virgin gets pregnant by a demon, the baby while inside her womb wants to feed on people. they try to make up for the fact that this is possibly the worst movie ever made with cursing and pointless nudity. all in all totally not worth the dollar it took me to rent it.

i just watched that movie, and was pretty disappointed. i didn't expect much to begin with as the premise of the movie doesn't suggest greatness anyway. sadly, it doesn't even manage to deliver just as stupid entertainment. the main problem is probably the acting. while i've seen far worse actors in far worse movies, the story would require some people to act out as violent maniacs, some others as people caught a in really stressing predicament, and they fail to deliver that. although i watched the german release i watched with the original audio, so it's definitely not just bad voice-overs or anything like that. added to that, the german dvd release seems to be cut, the killings are all pretty much left out, meaning that except for a few semi-gory scenes closer to the end the german release doesn't deliver as a movie for "gore-hounds", either. can't comment on that for other releases of course. the plot has some stupid moments thrown in here and there and the beginning is just hilarious (ever heard of a demon visiting a psychiatrist?). too bad the movie takes itself far too seriously, if it was filmed as a horror-comedy and changed a bit here and there accordingly it might have worked better. the ending is just a huge disappointment.if you've got really nothing better to do and just can't stand the boredom anymore you might (and it's really a weak "might") consider this movie. if there's anything else available to watch or do: pick that alternative.

a man comes to the office of the psychiatric dr. sammael (joan severance) claiming to be the demon asmodeus (kane hodder), the torturer of the 13th level of the hell, and he would like to tell weird things. he tells that he had made a deal with lucifer to become human again. he should knock-up his virgin sister mary elizabeth (alison brie) on the day that their mother died and she should kill six people and deliver the anti-christ, and then he would escape from the pit and reborn. when mary elizabeth gets pregnant, her stressed and abusive sister catherine (denise crosby) does not believe that she is virgin, but their father and former obstetrician albert martino (james callahan) examines his daughter and sees her intact hymen. meanwhile the church discovers the truth about mary elizabeth's pregnancy and sends the priest and former military father anthony (eddie velez) to spy mary elizabeth. she is dominated by the fetus and forced to kill a truck driver, lars (jorg sirtl), who is the lover of her tenant and friend jennifer (azalea davila), and jennifer herself and eat their hearts and drink their bloods, but she believes that she has nightmares. however during the ultrasound, she realizes that she is carrying a monster and she asks her father to stop her pregnancy. but it is too late.the awful "born" is a b-movie (actually a z-movie) that believes that is a great movie. the result is a pretentious and disappointing production, with an incoherent and absurd story without humor and terrible acting and direction. the plot is a complete mess: there is a priest that is a hit-man and former soldier; a demon in existential crisis going to a psychiatric; a father that examines the virginity of his daughter; two female-demons (succubus?) that stand naked like a statue with both hands covering their sexes; a character that is a slut, and only exists to expose her beautiful body. there are many scenes with free and cheap nudity. but the worst is the acting: the unknown lead actress alison brie is histrionic, with ridiculous voices and grimaces. sorry, ms. alison brie, but i hated your annoying performance. i have not recognized joan severance, who has a good performance, since i still had the image of her youth. denise crosby performs a hateful character and like everybody, she got older but she is still a good actress. i believe that if the writer and the director had included some dark humor and assumed that this movie is a b-movie, the story might have worked better and better. my vote is three.title (brazil): "o anti-cristo" ("the anti-christ")

this must rank as one of cinema's greatest debacles. i was wandering europe at the time and had the misfortune to stumble upon the crew making this movie in what was, even then, one of the world's idyllic, unspoiled settings. i was enlisted as an extra, and what followed was an exhibition of modern day debauchery. forget all the accusations you've ever heard of peter mayall's intrusions on this rare piece of french life- geoff reeve and his cohorts embarked on a level of revelry at the restaurant at les beaux that left the maitre'd slack-jawed in disbelief. they were, quite simply, awful, uncultured and undeserving of french hospitality.

it's weird, this film; you get the impression that the makers of this snooze-fest spent more time in the local bars than on set. in fact, it's a surprise not to see harry alan towers' name on the credits; it certainly has the flavour of one of his tax-shelter productions but here the motivation behind the project seems to be for all involved to enjoy a prolonged stay in provence. despite the fact that the film is supposed to take place all over the region, les baux and the area around it stands in for almost everything.david birney makes for a spectacularly colourless hero - as michael lonsdale says at one point "you're a walking cliché". what lonsdale is doing in this is anyone's guess. for some reason, the most interesting character, played by rampling, is sidelined, whereas, regardless of the book, she should have been the central figure because she clearly has the skill to carry the movie (which would have been dull anyway, but at least we'd have got more of something pretty to look at).all in all a pointless affair that is only worth watching to see how action-less an action movie can be.

a lot of alistair maclean's books have made it onto the big screen. some of them (the guns of navarone, fear is the key, where eagles dare) have been translated rather well; some (breakheart pass, ice station zebra, the secret ways) have been passable enough; a few (river of death, bear island, the way to dusty death) have been pretty rotten. caravan to vaccares is another movie based on one of maclean's perennially popular bestsellers, but alas this is yet another that deserves adding to the "rotten" list. peopled by uninteresting characters who get into uninteresting situations and escapades, caravan to vaccares is an absolute failure, both as a thriller and an entertainment. its only semi-redeeming qualities are: a) that it is filmed on very attractive provence locations, and: b) charlotte rampling looks utterly ravishing (with fully nude scenes to boot) as the main female character.disillusioned american drifter neil bowman (david birney) is travelling aimlessly through france when he meets british photographer lila (charlotte rampling). they decide to accompany each other, and during their wanderings make the acquaintance of mysterious nobleman duc de croyter (michel lonsdale). the duc persuades the pair to aid him in protecting and escorting hungarian scientist zuger (michael bryant), who is sought by various shady parties because of some information that he is carrying in his head. kept secret from bowman and lila is the fact that zuger has discovered a secret formula for using solar power as cheap, economical energy. the hungarian needs desperately to get his formula to new york, but hired guns have been put on his trail to capture him  presumably so that he can be taken back to some ruthless criminal lord and tortured into revealing his priceless secret, which they can then sell on to the highest bidder. bowman and lila find themselves and their terrified fugitive on the run in the french countryside from their deadly adversaries.the film seems terribly cheap and amateurish, almost like an ultra low-budget independent film made by a non-professional cast and crew. yet a fair sum of money was actually thrown at the film, and all those involved have, at various points in their careers, done much better work. therefore, one has to assume that the film is bad simply because it has been written, acted and directed with a distinct lack of care and interest. the pacing is deadly slow, and the plot points become so laborious that the viewer has to put in too much unrewarded effort to keep up with the story. birney's performance is uninvolving, and rampling only creates a stir due to her nude scenes  the character itself is an absolute bore, and the actress looks rightly bored by it. for those who manage to stick with the film right to the very end, there is an unusual scene featuring some deadly rodeo clowns and a fierce bull (!) which, while not particularly exciting or well executed, is at least different to the norm. caravan to vaccares is a very disappointing film in most respects, and once more a strong novel by the prolific author has suffered during its transition onto the screen.

the ending made my heart jump up into my throat. i proceeded to leave the movie theater a little jittery. after all, it was nearly midnight. the movie was better than i expected. i don't know why it didn't last very long in the theaters or make as much money as anticipated. definitely would recommend 

the production value of avp2 can be described by one adjective: awfulthe script is ridiculous, even in the fictional area of avp: what are the facehuggers good for on the predator's ship? why is the predator cleaning up all signs of his influence and than wasting precious time with eviscerating and even presenting the body of an insignificant human cop? why is the predator alone? why is the predator equipping himself only on earth but on his home planet? why does the predator make his job so uneasy for himself by hunting down the aliens rather than bombing the whole countryside like the humans do in the end? why is the predator dropping more & more of his few weapons rather than collecting them to keep them together after using one. in the end he is even dropping his armor before fighting the predalien in hand to hand combat: what a bad plagiarism of the first predators final fight between arny and the predator. the predator's gestures are so exaggerated that he is moving more like a japanese sumo than like highly skilled extraterrestrial-safari-hunter. as one can see immediately the whole story is a mess. but it gets even worse because this botched-up job is filled up with boring patchwork of senseless interludes like a lengthy pizza ordering episode or some detailed information about the criminal past of the two brothers (dallas & ricky). the sheriff is of course the friend of these two criminals who he puts regularly behind bars. (not convincing & absolutely superfluous for the plot).in addition to that the cast of actors is horrible. compared to the high class of directors & actors of the former aliens or predator movies avp2 is an embarrassingly bad piece of crap.at last the action of the movie is really poor. there is not a single scene of action combat in which the audience can see the whole set. each and every fight is filmed in short & shaky bursts with close up zoom at nearly full darkness. that results in an atrocious experience for the audience because one can mostly see nothing but a dark shaky screen.i suggest the two directing brothers strause to buy themselves a steadycam and get a lesson in modern cg so that the next film contains some visible action of visible figures and might not need to disguise their bad directing abilities in such a manner.i would advise anybody (even die hard avp fans) against watching this film: prefer the first one or the original aliens or the original predator films but avoid disappointing yourself by wasting your precious time on this failure.

this entry doesn't contain a spoiler. it doesn't have to. the movie is as predictable as the sunrise. the element in the first alien movies was the suspense that something could happen. this was so in the first two predator movies, though less prevalent. requiem has totally removed the element of suspense and replaced it with blood and gore. you know people are going to die (well duh, it is a avsp movie), but you know who is going to die and when they are going to die, and where they are going to die before it happens. the directors should take a lesson from hitchcock who said, "suspense is not a time bomb going off under a table. suspense is a bomb not going off under the table". what's the sense in going to a movie when you know exactly what is going to happen and when? if you really, really want to watch this movie, wait until it comes out on video and then rent it, but by no means would i ever buy it.

the review on the main page admits that the movie is horrible but that you should forgive it because it is nicely violent. no you shouldn't. there are spoilers at the end of this review but how i can "spoil" this rotten movie i have no idea. even if you are a die hard alien/pred fan like i am wait for the dvd. it isn't worth a 3.99 rental either but you'll be much less inclined to truly hate this film if you pay that than 12 bucks or better per person plus concession purchases at a theater.in the theater i watched avpr there were exactly two laughs, both by a girl sitting next to me. other than that there was total silence throughout. no ooohs, or "that was bad ass!", nothing. imagine being a patient on an operating table and just being given the anesthetic. now you know what you'll feel like in the theater after the opening scene of avpr.what was the budget on this movie? like war of the worlds, mi 3, and other f/x driven movies the director seems far more involved in what the cgi people can come up with than developing characters or a plot. spielberg has tried and failed at this several times, usually with tom cruise. sure the movies make money but should they? war of the worlds and minority report had the budget to pay for a decent script, tom cruise et al, and ss himself but were still awful. i'm sure avp wasted 90% of their budget on cg and had no choice but to hire any actor that would say yes even though the casting agent would have done better by going to the supermarket and picking actors at random.there is no tension developed in any scene so we are never close to being surprised. who cares who gets killed? we didn't know any of them, we all know what happens when the lil aliens make their corporeal exit, we all know the blood is acid. in alien, aliens, 3, resurrection, and even avp the directors make use of the fact that the aliens can think, can hide and can lay traps. this director decided that the ridley scott, james cameron, and others were idiots for developing characters you actually want to see either live or get killed. in this installment you will never care who lives or dies, not a kid, a parent, a pregnant woman. the characters serve only one purpose in this movie, to die. the opening scenes establish the fact that the movie is going to be a predictable joke. the character development scenes mix clichés, bad humor, and bad acting and numb the viewer to the point where we really don't care if they get killed so long as they die in never before seen ways. but they don't. the director tried to make something different from those who preceded him in the alien franchise but only succeeded in discarding the good parts of the first films, the human protagonists, and stealing the rest from other recent sci-fi films.there is not one original use of the either the alien or pred characters. the pred actually has little trouble killing aliens by the dozen even though the last movie led us to believe that pred revered the aliens as such a deadly foe that they used the killing of one as rite of passage. the alienpred is never really developed as a fearsome creature. its ability to inject parasites into a host is ripped from several different movies most recently probably was hellboy where samiel's dismembered tongue injected eggs into hellboy or doom where the mutated creatures would leave their tongues behind after they speared a victim's throat.simply put we aren't given reason to care about anything in this movie. there is violence but it doesn't shock or surprise and is nothing that hasn't been seen in any of a hundred slasher flicks. the cg is ok and both species of alien are made to look and move as they have in movies past. but since the characters are never developed and the acting is so bad we kind of hope that they all die. the little girl was probably the best actor of the bunch but sadly we aren't made to care whether or not kids, women, or anyone else lives or dies. we just want the movie to end. eventually it does but not before another stolen plot line from resident evil 2 has a nuke aim gunnison's way to wipe out the "infection". and not before yet another stupid scene that is supposed to open the door for further sequels but does it? in a movie filled with bad scenes the worst may have been saved for last.sorry for the repetition but everything bears repeating: bad script, no plot, unoriginal action scenes, uninspired direction, abysmal acting, decent f/x that were wasted because of the many flaws.i don't mind going to an indie film and being disappointed. the actors and directors and crew are probably getting their careers going and working on a shoestring budget. for a movie with this type of budget and hype i feel cheated along with disappointed. this movie is a painfully boring waste of time from the opening scene to closing credits. sad to say that a preview of hellboy 2 was the best part of avpr and hb2 didn't even look that good.

i really, really don't understand how that movie could get a rating bigger than 4 here on imdb. it's simply a huge mess, and i have to admit that i actually liked avp 1: close to no story, okay, i can live with that, but at least they got to the point pretty much at once. avp 2 does not. after the stupid premise has been presented there is well over half an hour of stupid and unfitting teenager clichés, dumb as hell dialog and close to nothing else, except for a few alien scenes that feel like an excuse to have that first half of the movie and predator scenes that make you ask yourself whether those guys making the film even watched any other predator movie or just didn't care enough to be bothered.after that, that crap-fest finally gets to the point where the predator starts attacking the aliens, or at least pretends doing so. and boy, is that predator stupid, blind and deaf. it's awful. how he even managed to earn that stuff he has is beyond me. he misses with almost every shot, only notices aliens when they're right in his face or if it's absolutely necessary for the script, so that he can move where he has to be. he even gets caught on surprise by puny human teenagers and deputies all of the time. what's that guy supposed to be? after the first hour of that abomination i was more or less constantly shaking my head at every scene. close to no scene in this movie passes by without unbelievably stupid dialogs, stupid predator actions or stupid lack there-of or stupid actions from our "heroes".then, that thing finally ended. to my surprise not only me and my friends didn't know whether to laugh or to cry, but everybody i overheard leaving the room was half-crying, half-laughing about those 1 1/2 hours they just wasted.don't watch. never.

i love b movies, but i like to be aware from the beginning that i'm watching one. i can't believe someone could mess up a movie about aliens and predators so bad. aliens and predator are awesome. this movie made a big joke out of them. the creators didn't take this movie seriously at all. i am throughly disappointed in how the strauss jerks handled this film. they made a mockery of amazing characters. it's like they were trying to be serious in the beginning, then their writers got high and gave up. almost nothing was continuous, the main characters were awful and were not aliens or predators. i am so ridiculously sad that no one takes alien and predators seriously anymore. these characters are icons of american pop culture and the creators of this movie showed no respect to the original films. they should not be allowed to cash in on the names of the previous films and they should be ashamed of themselves

from what i understand, fox was embarrassed they released a pg-13 alien/predator movie not so long ago. it was not well received by any means.not exactly sure where to go next, seeing as they thought anderson was the best director for the franchise and they had produced a true sci-fi gem, fox turned to it's small, but knowledgeable group of monkeys for answers.these monkeys were by no means veterans of writing sci-fi flicks, but had seen burton's planet of the apes remake and house of the dead. their first task: hire actors. fox gave them a reasonable budget but the monkeys wanted to save the money. they hired fifteen tv actors shortly after.now, the script. the monkeys wanted to save more of the budget so they wrote the movie themselves. leaving out important aspects of the two franchises was the easy part. thinking of great new lines for the general audience to remember years down the line - that was more difficult. they butted heads awhile and came up with a truly award-winning screenplay equipped with cliché characters, idiotic decisions an gaping plot holes.fox was pleased thus far with the results but wanted to see what was to become of the centerpieces to the film - the aliens and predators. the monkeys again wanted to save money in the budget so they decided to trash the great robotics used in the otherwise terrible avp original and go with the man-in-the-suit alien seen in the old films. the actors playing the aliens had trouble fitting into the suits as they weren't properly sized by the monkeys so they jiggled their plastic heads throughout the film with honor. as for the predators, the monkeys decided one predator was enough this time around (again, saving budget) to fight the hordes of aliens that seemingly come out of nowhere. but what about the effects, you ask? come on now, people. they may be monkeys but they clearly knew cgi would play a key role in the film. without diving into the budget, the monkeys used a standard final cut program and cut and pasted some very nice fire and spark effects throughout. putting red and green filters over the camera lens provided some excellent predator visions.the setting was something the monkeys thought long and hard about. if this was to be on earth, in colorado of all places, they needed to make it realistic. this was where they admitted they might have made a mistake. see, the monkeys didn't have proper training in this department so they thought turning the lights off in the city and having the movie play out in the dead of night and in the rain was the right thing to do. they simply forgot people like to see the creatures instead of looking at shadows and rain the whole film. to add insult to injury, the monkeys accidentally filmed all the fight scenes incredibly close so no one could see what was fighting or who it was. but again, rookie mistake.the rating. fox told the monkeys to make the movie r-rated. that was easy. without showing how many of the injuries or deaths actually happened, the monkeys made a habit of showing the carnage after the fact. it was simple: the viewers got the gore they desired and the monkeys didn't have to film the majority of action shots involving that violence.some of the actors originally had questions concerning the screenplay. why does a blue liquid the predator has endless amounts of magically disintegrate whatever he wants it to and nothing more than that? why is an ex-convict driving around in a police car the entire movie? why did the monkeys forget to show a full body shot of the aliens? why does a clock play a more memorable role than any of the main characters? the list of questions just kept growing but the monkeys ignored them and finished their masterpiece. fox was thrilled with their work. so thrilled that they opened the movie nationwide on christmas day and even spent a few bucks advertising it the week before it came out. the monkeys had successfully made another installment in these cherished franchises.but some ask, what ever happened to the budget the monkeys forgot to use? they put it towards their next film: aliens vs. predator vs. hulk hogan. they knew the general public would be upset with the title but they have since released this statement:"to the people- do not worry about our upcoming film. it will be rated r and will have violence."and everyone lived happily ever after. the end.

this frothy romantic comedy is based on the kind of story i loved as a teenager, but now find rather distasteful. in the case of may-september attachments, doubtless what is on the mind of the elder party is either lust, or an inability to face the reality of aging, or both. and the younger is most likely looking for the kind parent that she (or he) lacked as a child. these underlying agendas seem more pathetic than romantic to me now; there is also something rather predatory about them.dick powell looked a bit embarrassed--as well he should--at playing the elder lover in this silly story. he was, at fifty, attempting the role of a thirty-eight-year-old man romancing a teen-ager. but young debbie reynolds was a knockout--pretty and saucy and full of vinegar--as a misbehaving seventeen-year-old presented as a kind of "gift" to the morally upright and honest screenwriter, as a subject for him to study. her spirited performance wrung from me a better rating than this film would otherwise deserve. anne francis was cast as powell's beautiful, but brittle fiancée, and handled her small role deftly.some of the dialogue was quite amusing, too, so it's not a total washout.5/10

a ridiculous comedy given an arms-flailing direction. i love one of the comments here: "couldn't be made today". well, neither could "the philadelphia story" without a car chase or two. nonetheless, does that mean the picture is worse for the wear for being old-fashioned? i don't think "susan slept here" was good for any generation and it should fester peacefully in the memories of debbie reynolds-buffs. there is no sparkle in this story of a screenwriter who latches onto a much-younger girl for 'script research'. dick powell makes his farewell screen appearance in what must have been an embarrassment to him. reynolds is pallid. produced by one harriet parsons--who gives her famous mother louella a number of inane plugs. *1/2 from ****

this is the kind of film that i am wondering why anybody would have considered doing it from the beginning. this is the kind of movie that i cannot understand how people put money in it, how the rental store can put the dvd on its shelves. this is the kind of movie i blame myself for having rented it. there are good class-b movies, and i do not reject the genre. when they are good, they catch the interest with the action, they have characters written well enough, and acted well enough so that you can care about them. the effects in some of these movies support the film in many cases, and you may like them for the originality. almost nothing is true in 'coronado'. the subject and the script is at the level of cheap comics - just a cliche. the effects are cheap - and i do not care that the film is low budget - you can do a lot with low budget, but you need some talent. there are so many continuity and other directing errors as in ten other films. you do not care for the characters, you do not laugh, and at the end of the film you are left wondering if the parody was intentional or not. the only quality i could find is the scenery, there are some good locations, worth a much better film. 2/10 on my personal scale. the worst film of the year so far.

i obtained this little piece of scuzz on the videoasia "tales of voodoo" dvd label. quite where the voodoo is supposed to fit in, i have no idea. indeed i would not usually connect voodoo with indonesia anyway (let alone with wips).i know and love wip movies. i have seen most of them. i could not therefore resist this little known gem from the description given to it on the cover.it is appalling. you cannot have a wip movie if the women keep their clothes on (even in the shower!). although it gives a nod to the exploitation genre, wip without nudity is like a big mac without the beef.as my gym teacher used to say, on the whole, i'd rather be at the disco....

i do not understand why anyone would waste their time or money on utter trash like this... don't get me wrong -- i love a good western -- notice i said "good" -- this is just trashthe acting is horrible -- val kilmer must know someone or owed a favor or something for them just to use his face and name in this ridiculous piece of crap...to those of you who enjoyed this movie, i am making a list of you're names to ensure i do not watch anything you suggest -- our tastes are definitely different, yet it is your right to voice your opinion, no matter how far off base it is.i gave this movie a 2 just in case they do throw out all of the one's and not count them.... just bad in all area's...

dead man's bounty (the film's american title) has the look and feel of a classic italian western. the cinematography, costumes, and sets look great. the cast is rugged, not a pretty face among them. at the beginning i was preparing for a pretty cool movie but what i eventually witnessed was an absolute disaster.the script was perfectly dreadful. there was no suspense whatsoever and very little action or worthwhile drama.despite looking great, the cast spoke (english) with heavy european accents that were often unintelligible.the final nail in it's coffin was the broad streak of pretentiousness that paints most of the picture, focusing heavily on the character of the barmaid who's featured in a couple of very awkward sex scenes. also her speech near the end was pretty repugnant!the only novelty comes from the stunt casting of val kilmer in the role of the dead man, continuing his recent string of doa performances!

the only reason i rented this movie was that val kilmer rarely stars in a bad movie. there is of course a first time for everything. in many ways, this movie proves that oaters aren't as easy to make as we think, especially by foreign directors. the only one who got by with it was probably sergio leone, but even his movies lacked that something indefinably innate to our american psyche and panache. american actors in clint eastwood and henry fonda did help . i can see now why they changed the original title from "summer love" to " dead man's bounty". that itself tells me the producers and director didn't have any core understanding about a western other than those standard shoot'em up scenes and violent themes. i suppose we can say the same about american directors attempting to make a polish movie while failing miserably in the process.

this is said to be the first polish western and is written and directed by piotr uklanski. known in the u.s. as dead man's bounty, this film uses some strange visuals to tell a story that is short on dialog. val kilmer plays a corpse and some scenes are through his dead eyes. some awkward visual situations are actually comical in a sick way. my favorite is a young man building a gallows chops off one of his own fingers and actually hangs himself testing the strength of the rope. a cowboy known only as 'the stranger'(karel roden)finds a dead man(kilmer) that he thinks is a wanted man. he takes him to the nearest town to collect the bounty. he ends up losing the corpse and the potential bounty in a gambling game with the town's drunken sheriff(boguslaw linda)and has the few townsmen turned against him when he has a dalliance with the barmaid(katarzyna figura). he manages to escape sure death and leads the small posse on a dangerous 'wild goose chase'. one scene has the stranger tending to a scalp wound by cauterizing with gunpowder and a match. the corpse rots chained to a hitching post as the sheriff finds out that there is no bounty to be had. this movie also known as summer love has a haunting theme song sung by john davidson. nevertheless this western is like watching a train wreck. there is just something that tells you not to look...but you do.

i mean, come on! now my countrymen have started to make westerns! is it not enough that our cinema sucks already? now you need to infect english-language movies with polish acting and no sense whatsoever? please, stay away from this movie, do not waste your eyes on it. a 5-year-old baby could make a movie that makes more sense. i am from poland and i am ashamed this title might actually be watched by you. please, i am begging you, do not watch this movie and if you do, do not judge polish people and polish movies based on what you see there. we had some good movies in our history and we had some bad ones but this one - it is like nothing worse that i have seen in my entire life. keep away!!!

sure, you get to see some boobies, but if that's all you're looking for in a film, you get more mileage from youtube. i just paid a dollar from redbox because i saw val kilmer's name. bad move. plot didn't thicken, dialogue was shoddy, characters undeveloped at best. somebody said cinematography was alright but don't expect too much. this movie moved very slow and ended without grace. blacklist. i spent much of the movie wondering if some event or color scheme of things was symbolic. i never actually rewound to figure it out because nothing was ever explained in the end. no twists. it also left many questions that as it turns out, i had no desire to hear answered. one of the worst movies i have ever seen.

as most of you, i've watch a lot of great movies; in between those we often either voluntarily or mistakenly also find those movies that are so pointless that we think of reasons as to why anyone would make it. this is exactly what i can say for dead man's bounty....the very least i can do is try to "warn" some of you. if you enjoy being entertained by a motion picture because of the story, acting and intensity than you might want to chose something else. now, it's not all bad.....in fact, if all you want is creative film editing, and unique angles along with original music ambient than you might think it's ok. as someone that values movie plots, acting and being entertained by a film, the truth is i thought this movie was so terrible beyond words. i could easily find a spot for it on my list of worst movies seen in a while. as for having val kilmer in this, the truth is he was casted probably as a favor to the director; as a fan of some of kilmer's films, i can't understand what his motive for this was. the movie seems part western part romance.........in the end, i'm sure most of you can agree with me that it simply is a rude waste of our time. in case you haven't seen this movie, my recommendation would be to avoid it completely.

i wish i would have read more reviews and more opinions about this movie before i rented it. a waste of money. a waste of time. very little dialog. the dialog was hard to understand in every way. the storyline and plot were both weak. the only thing that was nice at all was the cinematography.the characters were interesting. at the same time you will spend so much time trying to figure things out, because of the lack of dialog, that you will be rewinding the movie a lot. do not watch this movie. it was a mess and will leave you feeling like a mess.you will say, what the heck was that, when the movie ends?

i had never heard of dead man's bounty when i saw it at the dvd store a few weeks ago, and i thought i had stumbled upon an unrecognized gem, since it had val kilmer in it in a truly unique role. sadly, it wasn't more than ten or fifteen minutes into the movie that i realized that this is a disaster of epic proportions. the first clue you will see of how genuinely awful this movie is comes near the beginning, when you have a bunch of dirtbags in an old saloon laughing like a bunch of hyenas in a scene that goes on about five times too long. it's unbelievable how bad it is. and sadly, it doesn't get any better.val kilmer is featured prominently on the movie's cover box, maybe to trick you into thinking that he has a role in the film, but unfortunately his bizarre role as a dead man is overlooked in favor of focusing on a bunch of half-wit crooks and the most inept conceptualization of a unique town sheriff that i've ever seen in a movie. he's played by boguslaw linda, who is unable to or uninterested in covering his polish accent, immediately making it impossible that the movie is meant to take place in the american old west. does poland have this type of frontier past? i don't know. my knowledge of polish history is not my strong point, but i can tell you this, the sheriff, as he is known in the movie, is the worst representation of law enforcement that i can ever remember seeing in a movie. he is introduced in a truly ridiculous scene where he is wearing some kind of blindfold and a roomful of men take turns punching him in the face. before they start hitting him, he explains that they can each hit him once, and then, after the first round, they will each hit him again, and if he can identify who is throwing the punches, they lose. what the hell is this crap? i am completely at a loss to explain why a scene like this would ever be put into any movie. throughout the movie, the sheriff continues to appear more and more beaten and bruised and drunk and battered, until ultimately he does nothing but show up occasionally, stumbling on screen and mumbling "notwithout...the law" you see, there is a lot of talk and preparation for a hanging, the details of which are as meaningless as the rest of the movie. it takes place, by the way, in a town that consists of nothing more than two ramshackle wooden buildings facing each other across a flattened bit of dirt that is more of a path than a road. my understanding is that it is a part of poland that is supposed to look acceptably enough like the american southwest, where none of the characters, except maybe the dead guy, could possibly have come from.i have heard that val kilmer accepted the role because he was intrigued by his unique role, and also by director uklanski's minimal use of dialogue in favor of a reliance on cleverly timed juxtaposition of images in unique visual montages. yeah, whatever. seems to me that kilimer was unable to overcome what must have been the truly satisfying feeling that he must have gotten when he was offered the role. personally, i would really feel that i had reached quite some level of success if someone approached me and offered me probably a few hundred thousand dollars to come and lay still for a while. i like to think that he didn't even read the script for this mess, because if he did i am at a total loss to understand why he accepted the role.at any rate, the movie opens with a man bringing in the corpse of a man, played by kilmer, seeking the reward. soon he finds himself embroiled in a ludicrous love story involving the town prostitute, the alcoholic sheriff, and lots of mayhem involving a series of stupid, stupid characters. there is also a extensive and preposterous lack of understanding of american rituals. in one scene, a man cuts a cherry tomato in half and squishes the halves into kilmer's eyes (for what reason, i can't imagine), and then later, a man makes a short speech over kilmer's corpse, in which he explains that he was "one of the finest men we ever had," and then he proceeds to lop his head off with a shovel. what the hell?? not convinced yet? here are some more reasons not to watch it. in one scene the sheriff appears to be covered with ash, except for the perfectly clean areas around his eyes and what can only possibly be described as bright red lipstick. a man gets a head wound that drenches his head and body in blood. in a daze, he cauterizes it with gunpowder. smart. near the end, the sheriff appears to have a broken arm. sitting at the bar, he puts a rope around his neck and connects it to his injured arm, and uses his good arm to pull on the rope, lifting his shaking beer glass in his bad arm to his mouth, rather than using his good arm to drink. also smart. why doesn't he just use his good arm? i have no idea. that, like everything else in the movie, makes no sense whatsoever, like the title. summer love? are you kidding me? avoid this mess at all costs. in the meantime, here's something for the imdb goofs page  errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers) : this movie got made. ha!

i didn't hate this movie as much as some on my all time black list, but i consider it a total wast of film. jeremy irons, iron jeremy, ron jeremy. think about it. scene one is very good, all the rest are crap.

i saw this film while i was in france and i must say that it confused me. it is a story of a jewel thief and a young singer who each end up in morocco at the same time, run into one another and form a connection. simple enough? well, the problem is that this is the sort of film that has ambiguity in both chronology (the film is not played entirely in order) and in reality (did what i just saw really happen, or was it only a dream?). given those parameters, as well as the film being bilingual, it was really hard to follow, and i was not sure as to what happened at the end. i imagine some deep artsy types could understand this film better than i could, and it may require more than one viewing to understand.

this is the type of film that makes you question your past admiration for a particular director before you stop and remind yourself that there are very few people whose body of work doesn't contain a few clunkers.the casting in lelouch's films is of utmost importance because he puts the viewer into such intimacy with the characters. the actors have to bring real screen magic to live up to the intensity. otherwise it is just hollow. none of the actors in this film had any of that screen magic, in my opinion.jeremy irons and patricia kaas fell far short as the leads. irons is a talented actor but he was wrong for this part. lovable rogue didn't suit his strengths. his brand of charm also hit a false note for me here. iron's persona is too decadence-tinged to fit into a lelouch love story.although i would hesitate to pass up any opportunity to hear an english accent, i also think an american actor would have worked better in this role. so many of the songs that kaas sings are so closely identified with the americanness of the particular lyricist that it seemed kind of discordant to then have jeremy irons playing the love interest -- even though logically it really didn't matter. it still screwed up the flow of the movie somehow. at least for me.of course, it would have had to have been the right american. i think george clooney would have been great in the part. and he would have brought the screen magic in spades. brad pitt could also have done a really good job delivering his particular combination of charming and edgy.i was also very disappointed with patricia kaas. in reading about her, i've learned that she has a hugely successful career as a singer and many fans, so what do i know, but i found her screen presence as a singer very boring. she was actually a much better actress in her speaking scenes than she was a singer in those scenes in which she had to interpret and sell a song. nothing she sang moved me. she was pleasant but bland.in contrast, someone like kate hudson, who is not a professional singer and has only voice-coach french still would have handled this part a million times better. not to mention all that stunning french talent out there that could have been tapped into. it was wrenching watching patricia kaas take up screen space when there are so many charismatic french actresses who could have been cast instead. the music was so important in this film, it could not really work without the music working. and since kaas delivered so poorly in this respect, the movie never really had a chance.lelouch sealed the fate of this movie when he cast patricia kaas. jmo.

well...i like patricia kaas. she is a beautiful lady and an extremely gifted and versatile singer. her acting in this film is more than competent and from my point of view about the only redeeming feauture of this film. she very gently captures the essence of the lonely singer with a very serious helath problem. however what i tremendously dislike about the film is the shameless product placement for a well known french chain of hotels. the other thing is that the story seems to meander for way to long without really deciding what the film is about and what it wants to be. on a positive note you may argue that the film is not predictable but you could also say it's plainly boring because of the lack of cohesion. there are some nice shots in the film bujt you can't help thinking that all the parts just don't add up to anything at all. it really is a pity bevcause kaas really shines in this film.

i do not see what is the whole deal about this movie. patricia kaas sings, yes, and that makes the film charming, but singing is not enough. i mean, if you want to get all benefits of this one, go buy patricia's cd and enjoy! the plot is simple (if to omit the "dreams"); the main characters seem to love each other instantly, and as well instantly forget their other acquaintances. relationships appear almost "mandatory", and the little "detective story" thrown in just makes things worse. what at first appeared to be a perfect movie ending, is first screwed up and then comes out as just a dream. i measure movies by how well i would remember them, and for this one, i already started to forget the details.

i kept waiting for this film to improve, but, alack, this is the worst kind of escapist movie: a spun-sugar confection that sinks under the weight of its own ponderous self-importance. the pace stumbles on like a legionnaire stranded in the sahara. the absence of good dialogue leaves the appealing stars with little to do other than look good in white linen. irons plays yet another moneyed charmer who's had a touch of the sun. kaas is a pleasing singer but not much of an actress. luckily, the script does not often call on her to emote away from the jazz club microphone. all the enviably relaxed, pretty, unnecessary characters take turns masticating the scenery with an air of weary sophistication. the whole exercise comes across like an interminably long ralph lauren ad. if you're past forty and believe francophilia is the key to sophistication, you may well mistake this piece of cardboard for a baguette. well, if you liked this movie you probably felt smart for appreciating godard's leaden éloge de l'amour, and you may even have sat through le divorce without cringing.

this game is from a genre of games that tried to capitalize off of the whole myst-inspired trend--walk around, talk to people, solve puzzles. the puzzles themselves are absolutely horrible, but i'll stick to the acting itself, which is only slightly better. if you're looking for a convincing performance from any one character, you won't find it here, but this game is worth buying if only to witness the truly hilarious performance of christopher walken. his acting is so horrible in this game that it seems like he's imitating someone who happens to be impersonating him. he's a caricature of himself.so buy this game if you're masochistic, a walken fan, or simply want to hear the f-word a lot.

this program would be useful for training hardened felons basic human emotions. beyond this purpose, the show has no value other than to fill bandwidth that would otherwise go unutilized in the electromagnetic spectrum. i feel a greater sense of suspense and anticipation listening to a computerized voice chip endlessly droning out the products of a random number generator. fortunately, the helpful and frequent music cues will tell viewers how they're supposed to feel, in case they are unable to fully internalize the predictable and shallow plot line. i did find amy to be a superficially positive character, as she is a role model to young women that they can serve in traditionally male fields. unfortunately, her totally subjective approach to the law is guided solely by whatever capricious personal guidelines amy elects to employ, resulting in amy's trials more closely resembling appeals to the personal mercy of a tribal despot than a true administration of justice. this show is unpalatable in any amount, although this is to some extent mitigated after two episodes by the brain's god-given filtering processes, by which the show will thankfully leave the same imprint on the viewer's memory as a television tuned to a dead channel at maximum volume.

although this film has had a lot of praise, i personally found it boring. there are some nice brasilian sunsets and the characters are believable, but the story of how they interrelate, even if very unusual by our standards, is not interesting enough to sustain a movie this long. the central woman takes up with one man after another in a close knit way and putting the interests of her children first. as the tolerance of the various men is stretched, we see their characters develop. the story unfolds with dignity and aided by excellent acting. it is a rare glimpse into the brasilian hinterland, far from the city, but hardly exciting enough to keep one's eyes open for.

i though that it was hard, if not impossible, to watch, and not because of the horrors it depicts but by the way they were depicted. imagine what costa gavras could have done with this true horror story. what i object to is the idea the need to denounce, which i subscribe to, is enough. what about showing it to us with the power of powerful cinema. i feel that the eagerness of the filmmaker, maybe even the justifiable anger, didn't allow him to see it clearly from a cinematic point of view. or, if this was a cinematic point of view, i mean, a choice, then, i didn't like it at all. i was more disturbed by the way the movie was shot than by the movie itself. well intentioned i'm sure, but, unfortunately, that's not nearly enough.

i just finished watching disappearances at afi fest 2006 with about 30 other people in a mostly vacant 1000 seat auditorium. the festival programmer, after seeing the lack of audience, started his opening comments with, "well at least a few of those attending the festival have good taste in film". well mr. programmer, after watching this film i must answer back "no we don't, and either do you!" this "back-woods" period piece follows young (not so) wild bill as he and his mystic family dangerously run illegal canadian whiskey across the border during america's prohibition. the old-time outlaws (kris kristofferson and company) not only need the money to save their ramshackle vermont farm but want to introduce little wild bill to the virtues of manhood.although handsomely photographed, this adventure story lacks what makes films of this sort good, "tension" and believability. kristofferson's lackluster performance and dry monologue reminds me of a dream i once had where al gore was playing the role of willy wonka. i just didn't care and when wild bills mystic grandmother appears out of thin air to give him advice it just didn't fit. yes, i almost fell asleep more than once.gary farmer does do a good job as the cameron frye in ferris bueller character; brother-in-law of big bill while the teenage chris mcdermott does uses those piercing blue eyes to his acting benefit.but overall expect to see jay cravens disappearances playing at a block buster $2 bin near you.

like the previous poster, i am from northern vermont, and i was inclined to like this film. however, not since "red zone cuba" have i seen such a confusing plot. the things the people to bootleg make no sense. two of the gang paddle across the border send a second party across in a car. uhm, why? then they meet two others, and drive up at night in to the bad guy's hideout in a luxury packard. --wouldn't just two people in a flatbed truck make more sense? then, parked outside the garage that holds the targeted hooch, the four fall asleep! when they waken in the morning and and start hauling the whiskey out, of course they're spotted and shot at, losing some of their precious cargo in the process. then two of the smugglers put the whiskey in a boat and float it over the border. again, why? i am told by someone whose great uncle really did smuggle in the area, all one needed was to drive a vehicle that could outrun than the u.s. canada border patrol, which back then had a fraction of the resources it has now. and don't get me started on the last half hour, which made no sense whatsoever.the only good thing i can say about the film is that kris kristopherson has actually grown some charisma with the years.

i watched this movie so that you don't have to! i have great respect for kris kristofferson, but what was he thinking? he did this for scale? at least the film's title practices truth in advertising, since people and objects routinely disappear throughout the film, adding to the confusion. kristofferson mentions this in his commentary that even he wasn't sure if genevieve bujold's character really existed. this does not bode well for the viewer being able to follow the story!the "making of" feature was far more interesting than the movie itself. it explores the difficulty cobbling together funding for an indie, even as the film is being shot.to it's credit, this movie is visually pleasing and doesn't in any way look like a movie made with just slightly over 1m. too bad the money wasn't spent on a better project.

ok... so... i really like kris kristofferson and his usual easy going delivery of lines in his movies. age has helped him with his soft spoken low energy style and he will steal a scene effortlessly. but, disappearance is his misstep. holy moly, this was a bad movie! i must give kudos to the cinematography and and the actors, including kris, for trying their darndest to make sense from this goofy, confusing story! none of it made sense and kris probably didn't understand it either and he was just going through the motions hoping someone would come up to him and tell him what it was all about! i don't care that everyone on this movie was doing out of love for the project, or some such nonsense... i've seen low budget movies that had a plot for goodness sake! this had none, zilcho, nada, zippo, empty of reason... a complete waste of good talent, scenery and celluloid! i rented this piece of garbage for a buck, and i want my money back! i want my 2 hours back i invested on this grade f waste of my time! don't watch this movie, or waste 1 minute of your valuable time while passing through a room where it's playing or even open up the case that is holding the dvd! believe me, you'll thank me for the advice!

the movie plot seems to have been constructed from a disjointed dream. there is not enough realism to hold the viewer's interest. the vermont farm scene was a failed opportunity to show the way farms were set up and farm families lived which would have been interesting and entertaining. there was little if no research into the whiskey bootlegging trade of the period. the costumes of the canadians looked like something from the french revolution, totally unbelievable. the fiddle playing was good and of the time period but chris's motions while supposedly playing were unbelievable. the owl's appearance was a never explained mystery and the train disappearing into thin air was too much. i couldn't understand how a live trout got frozen into the ice and why two men in the wilderness without food would release the trout, a good food source.

could possibly be the worst film ever made. at least plan 9 from outer space was funny. i can't believe they talked someone into actually putting up money to make this thing. complete waste of celluloid. before i saw this crap i had some respect for kristophersson. i guess somebody needed a tax write off. please, in the name of all that which does not suck, stop whoever made this, before they suck again!this movie should be avoided by all people who are not on lsd, or my crazy cousin that insists we're part native american.if you are in the woods, and an owl starts talking to you, see a psychiatrist. it is not necessary to make a movie about it.

this well-meant film falls just a bit short, and unfortunately in too many areas.the scenery is gorgeous, with vistas of north-central vermont providing the setting for this mid-century tale. quebec bill endeavors to go back to his whiskey-running past in order to save his farm.going back and forth between scenes of magical realism and straight-forward action, this film rarely hits its stride.kris kristofferson as quebec bill seems pretty stilted, or else it's his lines; or else his cross of yankee and quebecois accents. anyway, he just comes off as a low-key blow-hard. his dialogs with gary farmer's coville character do sparkle, though. william sanderson's rat kinneson is solid. charlie mcdermott shows some real potential as young wild bill; but his part's not large enough to carry a scene and he never steals one. luis guzman shows up on lake memphramagog (with a fine stand-in performance by lake willoughby) as a monk with a boys'n'the hood accent: who knows? and then there's bujold's cordelia: an oracle like her namesake, she channels yoda as she intones lines like "you will marry a quebec woman!"?!? just too weird and nowhere near enigmatic enough.the end gets really choppy. again a bad mix of magical realism and the concrete. and yoda never provides an answer we can understand.

this is an awful movie from just about every point of view. since much has been already pointed out in previous reviews, let me just focus on "serbs" and "delta force" guys in this movie.1) the uniforms that "serbs" wear are not serbian. and helmets are wrong, too.2) the actors who play "serbs" are not speaking serbian, not even a language close to serbian, unlike in "behind enemy lines" where the czech actors did their best to speak the language and add at least a bit of credibility to the movie.3) the gray-bearded "serbian general" looks and acts like a moron, firing his gun whenever us soldiers call his name: - us soldier: "gravic! give up!"- gray-bearded moronic general: (fires his ak47)- us soldier: "gravic! come out!"- gbmg: (fires his ak47)- us soldier: "gravic! you're surrounded"- gbmg: (fires his ak47)- prop guy: "excuse me, mr. gray-bearded moronic general, see, we're out of blanks and i sent the boy to buy some more, but he's not back yet..."- gbmg: (click)4) since when does the army issue ak47s to the delta force? i guess they couldn't find enough working m4s in bulgaria, but there were plenty of old ak47s and practice blanks ;) maybe they should have went for some airsofts, they are cheaper and wouldn't have hurt the credibility of the movie anyway...5) in the scene where a df officer is hanging on a rope while talking to a rocket scientist, he is holding his finger on the trigger all the time. no sane person with any weapons training or just plain common sense would ever do that. i guess the actor figured that his coolness level increases the longer he holds the gun that way. this movie is such an insult to common sense..

as a huge fan of the original operation delta force, i thought i'd pick this film up. i figured it couldn't be too bad. however, here's a list of things i learnt from watching operation delta force 4: deep fault.- the delta force, despite being the elite in american armed forces, are mostly mildly-overweight men in their late 30s and early 40s.- the delta force, despite being the elite in american armed forces, carry standard police issue pistols or ak-47s on their most important missions.- the delta force, despite being the elite in american armed forces, haven't learnt that during stealth missions, wearing bright red ski jumpers and running around in open spaces aren't exactly going to keep you out of sight.- when you drop a molotov cocktail into a tank, it explodes externally like a grenade.- when you get hit by tank fire, you can run away, although the smoke caused may present minor difficulties for breathing.- you can die from one standard gun shot, but you can also live despite being hit multiple times by a sniper rifle, and a few times by an ak-47.- in hand-to-hand combat, members of the delta force, despite being the elite in american armed forces, are regularly pummeled by railroad attendants.- if bad guys are approaching you while on a slow-moving train, there's nothing to worry about - between the 4 of them, they can't manage to figure out how to get an automatic weapon to fire automatically, let alone hit anyone from 5 metres (16 feet) with at least 50 attempts between them.- if you're short on actors, just recycle them - the bad guy from operation delta force 1 plays a good guy called mac in operation delta force 4, and the guy who played mac in operation delta force 3 now plays skip lang, a different good guy.- it's not ok for the delta force to shoot an unarmed terrorist, even if he's attempting to reload his weapon to kill you.- grenades explode on impact with the ground when thrown by members of the delta force. when thrown by non-delta force personnel, they explode at exactly the point where the delta force members have thrown the grenades back at the bad guys.- tanks can drive faster than standard trucks.- militias and personal armies use the exact same chopper that the un used in operation delta force 1.- when a chopper arrives, a bad guy in that chopper cannot see you if you lie face-down.- shooting someone multiple times in the chest will cause minor damage. stabbing that person in the knee will kill them inside 5 seconds.- the delta force steal cars from old people to get around when in foreign countries, because the us military do not provide them with any means of transport. this may also explain why they caught public transport.as you can see, this is not really the finest moment in film-making, but it's good for a laugh.

****some spoilers****there's nothing in this movie that you haven't already seen browsing the net. nothing is shocking about this film. in the film a man sodomizes a goat, there's a bulldozer decapitation, and a lesbian's face gets burnt off. all of these scenes of "extreme violence" are so fake, it makes one wonder why anyone would even want to resurface this piece of trash. i simply cannot believe i spent hard earned money on what certainly has to be the worst film ever made. don't let reviews fool you, this film would be a shame for anyone to own...except maybe prisons who want to torture inmates. for a real exploitation classic, look to bloodsucking freaks or even the more recent doom generation. island of death sinks to the bottom of the movie toilet and needs to be flushed out of existence.

i believe that this was supposed to be shocking or something.... all that i can say is....poor goat!!! this flick is so poorly done that the parts that "should" shock and revolt you come across as laughable at best. the characters are so lame and 2....wait....1 dimensional, that i applauded each sick death.....all except that poor goat.

i kind of liked the film, it's just that the characters run around with no real point to their craziness. as i was saying, poor goat. the goat was nahing while the guy was pretending to grind on it. i would have liked the rape scenes to be more graphic (not the one with the goat though). jane ryall who played celia only did this one film. she was very nude throughout. this crazy couple who killed and tortured many people ended up in their rightful places. i almost forgot about the gay transvestite couple who are also picked out for being sinners. if you like crazy off the wall stuff, then this is your film. 3/10

i'm a big time horror fan, and i bought this movie from all the hype it was getting on the message boards. well, let me tell you i don't know whom was giving it all the hype, but let me speak on a few things.first of all this film is "not" a lot of things. it is not scary, not suspenseful, not overly gory, not overly sick (except for one season maybe) not beautifully scored.... at all.the premise of the movie is that a couple flee to a small island in greece because they have done a little naughtiness in london. we don't even know what they did, but it is presumed that they killed someone. **spoiler alert**the male lead kills a few people out of his perversion of "cleansing the island of perverts" oddly enough. the killings are cheap, the characters are cheaper and the effects suck.there is one part when he rapes a goat because his wife wont give him any in the morning, but even that is done without any care for how it is shot. end of spoilersthe end of the movie is about the only thing that isn't totally predictable. i especially enjoyed when the "herder" farts on the husband. anyway, if you can rent this and have 2 hours to waste go ahead. it's nothing better than a processed cheese sandwich on moldy bread.3/10

when this show first aired i will admit to being intrigued by the premise and the setting. with an open mind i watched the first two episodes and naturally dismissed it as being destined to run for a half-season at most. i happened to be watching a/e recently and witnessed an ad for this garbage and i could barely contain my surprise. i truly hope people are watching this for a laugh and not taking it seriously. the characters are truly some of the most ridiculous and outright laughable on television, scripted or otherwise. it's obviously generating ratings so i must give the creators credit for establishing and maintaining a fanbase, but i seriously hope no one is watching this under any pretense of seriousness.

for awhile i was hooked on shows like ghost hunters and destination truth and stuff, even though i thought they were full of crap i found them interesting and entertaining, and that's why we watch entertainment tv. it's fun to turn off your brain and believe that every shadow caught on camera is not just some shadow, but some insane asylum inmate's tormented spirit or something, so long as you can snap back to the real world later.that being said, enjoying paranormal state requires more than merely shutting your brain off, it requires you to consume lead in large doses on a regular basis during your childhood, then suffer repeated head trauma, then take up huffing paint in your teens. then you have to get high/drunk and watch.paranormal state is beyond the pseudoscience (which i can enjoy with a degree of critical thinking) that you'll find on ghost hunters (which i still find to be reasonably interesting and entertaining program), it's pseudo... everything.the show follows the adventures of a group of students from penn state university (not to be confused with university of pennsylvania) lead by ryan buell as they take it upon themselves to exorcise demons and spirits using ceremonies from whatever religion seems most dramatic at the time (ranging from catholic exorcisms performed by college coeds to wiccan spells cast by socially awkward goths, to native american cleansing rituals. to their credit, these are performed by native americans). if you believe in wicca or you're catholic or a follower of a traditional native american religions, i think you'd want their cleansing rituals performed by someone who... isn't a maladjusted college student with some free time. i don't remember the scene in the exorcist where the priests threw up their hands and said "it's no use! call up an after school club from the state college. this one is too much for us. they've probably read the wikipedia article on exorcisms." the show is frankly insulting to the intelligence to the viewer. the show's opening title sequence has ryan talking about prs (the paranormal research society), saying that when he came to penn state (notice you don't see any shows where the host says the same thing, but instead of penn state he says "when i came to mit" or "after i got my theoretical physics degree...") he found other people with similar interest in the paranormal. he says they are sometimes "warriors." i remember when i used to pretend i was a warrior and i fought ghosts. i was six. then the emotionless ryan brings out the flamboyant and obnoxious chip coffey, who pretends to go into trances and become possessed by cussing at the cast. awesome. i thought people had learned some sense about how ridiculous the idea of psychics and mediums is after "crossing over" went off the air. the show takes itself way too seriously, as this small group of societal misfits pretends they are battling against some ancient, cosmic evil. production values are low, stories are boring, and, unlike ghost hunters, which will occasionally catch something anomalous (although likely explainable, but interesting nonetheless) on their equipment, ps requires you to believe that the noises and creaks that they hear are evidence of demons, ghouls, and possibly leprechauns. the only thing scary about this show is that there are people out there that take it seriously. the only thing paranormal about it is that the people on it are able to make each episode while keeping a straight face.call me jaded, but i feel like the great mysteries of the universe and the afterlife are too great to be solved in a half-hour tv show by a journalism undergrad at a state school.all that being said, i highly recommend that everyone watch this show at least once, if for no other reason than the sheer entertainment derived from watching a truly terrible movie or tv show. or you can make a drinking game out of it. i think the second would be preferable.

i initially tuned in to paranormal state because i (more or less) find the paranormal search genre to be interesting tv, if nothing else.i really enjoy ghost hunters because well over half of their investigations result in total debunking, and find most haunted to be hilarious with its use of mediums and frumpy british women with paris hilton day-glo eyes fainting from fear/demonic presences all shot in lovely night-vision green.paranormal state has none of this appeal. it feels like it was cobbled together from "leads" that ghost hunters rejected. the episodes ranged from trailer trash families and single mothers with emo adolescents sitting around and scaring themselves, to an "interview" with a 5 year old about the monster who lives in his room (the monster goes rawrrr, we are told). all of these people calling upon a college club to solve their problems. the whole show is about ryan and his partner, his enormous ego. he leads his troupe of doe-eyed coeds around, except when a case is deemed "too extreme" and orders them to remain at the hotel hahaha. better leave it to the pros, ie himself.the unwitting comedy of this show is all in how gullible the participants are. ryan spins his tales of being hunted, followed, etc by a demon that he first encountered when the catholic church recruited him to assist on a case. sorry, but the catholic church has people who can do that, they don't need the day-shift manager at quiznos to chip in his 2 cents.this show is awful, shame on a&e for bankrolling this silliness, trying to follow in the footsteps of some much better paranormal-themed shows. it's almost unintentionally funny, except that ryan is so arrogant and devoid of charisma that watching the show long enough to mock it isn't worth the trouble.

it's perfectly ok that people dies in an animation, but there are just way too many death in this one. start from the very beginning, the story is all around battles, fights, death, and revenge. it goes on and on for entire one and a half hour. it was interesting at the beginning, but i grew very tire after before the show was half way through. unlike other animations, this one is lack of humor. there are not many interactions between the characters either. the good thing about it is the sword fight scene looks pretty good and the characters look nice.

well ok, i've seen wrath of the ninja.it isn't something that i would recommend to people who aren't seriously into japanese fighting movies. this is a sort of japanese fighting ninja movie, with a complex plot. it's about these 3 old ninja schools that had these 3 "swords of sorcery". i saw the subtitled version (not recommended by the way, it's easy to miss something) and i didn't really keep up with it all. it had some good scenes tough, but in general, it wasn't much to my liking.

hard up, no proper jobs going down at the pit, why not rent your kids! diy pimp story without the gratuitous sex scenes, either hard core or soft core, therefore reads like a public information film from the fifties, give this a wide miss, use a barge pole if you can.

this ultra-low budget kitchen-sink yawn is the kind of film that can only be made in the uk in that, anywhere else in the world the fact the a market would need to exist before a green-light would be given. most probably self funded this is clearly an attempt to redress important issues but ultimately undermines its point of existence in that the question needs to be begged, who would ever put money into distributing this and secondly if a market audience doesn't exist to watch, buy or rent this film, why would anyone bother in the first place? my opinions may sound unfairly harsh on a first time director but, this is the kind of film that only goes to undermine the commercial viability and quality standards which have only just kept a british film industry in existence. reviewed in edinburgh. 2 out of 10.

first of all, i just wanna say that i'm a very big naruto fan. i love the anime and the manga stories. also, the first movie just confirmed that naruto is all about great fun, great action, great story, ... but then came the 2nd movie. i was very hyped because the first movie turned out great. but it didn't satisfy me one bit... the story was lame, action wasn't all that great... especially compared to the anime series... same goes for the quality of animation. i found it very poorly... could the story get any lamer... any ??? where's the kyuubi of naruto ?? not once does he turn demon... i mean ... come on !!! my advice is... see the series ( until episode 140 , then it's just fillers ) and then read the manga because that's still great. ignore this movie and hope for something better in the future...all and all i gave it a 4, just because it's naruto...

i struggle to see the point of this movie. it is supposed to be a comedy but i didn't laugh once. the storyline is one that could have been interesting in a well made movie, but since this is acted by comics, the result is totally unbelievable (as comedies should be). the comic strip series was very hit and miss, even withing the episodes, and it is fair to say all of the people involved have gone on to do greater things. one to avoid. i have also just found out that comments have to be 10 lines long. the whole point of these comments is to give an indication of whether the movie is worth watching: not write an essay gushing about it or taking it apart. if you like: seinfeld, larry sanders, the young ones, alan partridge, arrested development, curb, red dwarf, then you might like to pass on this. on the other hand, if you like lame jokes such as can be found in friends and dodgeball, enjoy watching this!

the comic strip featured actors from 'the young one's' - a student based sitcom from the 80's. comic strip features included parodies of westerns, 'the famous 5', and the professionals - all a lot funnier than this. having said that alexei sayle puts in a good turn as a traffic cop with ambition and the soundtrack features great music from the era. 5/10

poorly acted and poorly directed, "congo" unsuccessfully tries to recreate the feeling of "jurassic park". but the truth is, the book wasn't all that great either. still, the movie's first problem is that tim curry's character was added; the second problem is that the talking arm was added; the main problem, though, is that the cast members don't create realistic characters. i guarantee that this movie will not make you think that there are killer gorillas anywhere on earth. also starring laura linney (happy birthday, laura!), dylan walsh, ernie hudson, grant heslov, joe don baker, james karen and bruce campbell; i'm guessing that they don't wish to emphasize this movie in their resumes.

it is a shame that such a great book was turned into such a terrible movie. i could not wait to see this movie after reading the book....it really did not do it justice.

this is just one of those movies that continually make you groan and that i wished was over. the problems are many and the good points are few. i feel the main problem with this movie is that it has what amounts to a cheesy plot and they try to make it out to be a epic movie, which a movie about super evil monkeys and smart ones that sign just is not epic, it is cheese. when you have cheese you make the movie more fun. granted, the final scene with the monkeys and that laser was very nice to watch and more of things of that nature was needed. instead the actors are doing such a serious job that you feel the movie just has a corny plot amid all the serious tension the movie is trying to set up. the plot revolves around a woman trying to find what happened to her missing ex-husband while also searching for some sort of legendary diamonds. she uses these two guys who trained an ape to do sign language and now wish to return her to the wild as cover to get into the country and begin the mediocre adventure of a lifetime. the only things that make this movie somewhat tolerable is ernie hudson's character and the laser attack at the end.

i'm really not too sure why people are being so complimentary about this odd movie. having said that - i did actually sit through the entire 2 hours and can't say it wasn't entirely un-entertaining.i think the key problem is that frank marshall is not a true director and this is clear in the film - he is an experienced producer, so will have seen a movie made many a time, and will understand what goes into the process. but i think this is quite different to being able to truly direct a movie - the direction was competent, but somehow flat and direction-less. marshall has more experience as a unit or second director, and this came through, i feel, in the finished product - it appeared to be a group of sets that failed to really have any continuity in its feel or its character.fun, watchable, but good? no.

it's hard to tell if this ham-brained b-movie adventure is a spoof, a homage or just plain bungled, but it doesn't work whichever way you look at it. based on michael crichton's so-so novel, it's a nutty mixture of lost cities, giant hippos, monster monkeys, naff visual effects and corny dialogue. the first thing that scuppers this tosh is the gorilla that can communicate in sign language, and needless to say the film doesn't get any better from that point on. making all this old rope somewhat worthwhile are tim curry, turning in a feverish slice of ham and sporting a bizarre accent that defies identification, and ernie hudson, who also seems to know that this is all a load of old rubbish.

congo is another multi-milion dollar adaptation of crichton's works. like jurassic park, the lost world, sphere, etc, the film raped the book of its true meaning and essence. i'll make this short and to the point. the scenery is beautiful. the actors, well it's the best they can do. the script? try congesting hundreds of pages into an hour and half movie. you get a mess in the end but how neat of a mess is what counts and congo falls somewhere below that. there were some silly moments, like why did the killer gorillas decide to jump into the lava? and amy, raised by humans, surrounded by humans, yet can intimidate dozens of killer apes around her? what sort of twist of common sense is that? which brings me to this. if there was an annoying character in every movie, amy ranks of one here. you see amy is this naive little female ape who can talk with a special backpack and harness strapped to her. neat idea, but it gets annoying after awhile hearing her talk. congo is worthwhile to see, and not deplorable, but certainly not a memorable film either.

the basic story idea of enchanted april is excellent--two very unhappy wives meet and decide to pool their funds to rent an italian villa for a month. to further defray costs, they get two other strangers to come along. what makes it interesting are the relationships both before and during this vacation--in particular, showing how this beautiful setting actually changes their outlooks on life. unfortunately, this good idea is totally spoiled by two key performances in the ensemble cast that are so bad that they ruin the film. ann harding plays the most important role in the film in a manner that makes her seem ridiculous. her "doe-eyed" expression and vacant stares really make you wonder if this isn't a zombie movie or she's just meant to be an idiot! and to make it worse, reginald owen plays a character so obnoxious and bombastic that i was very close to turning off the film--he was that awful and unbelievable. i noticed that at least one reviewer gave this movie a 10--which is very, very difficult to understand. sure, the film has great ambiance and a good plot, but these two glaringly silly performances cannot be overlooked as they undermine the rest of the picture. sorry, but this film was aching for a re-make!

the 1935 version of "enchanted april" manages to be simultaneously tediousand perfunctory. it is difficult to show the transformative magic of italy shooting in a studio with only stereotypical italian behavior to belabor. the transformation of the four strangers fleeing london is instantaneous in the cut from the first day to a week later. rather than develop, the screenplay flips a switch and thecharacters are different.the husbands are boring enough in flashbacks without turning up, even if their presence does not drive the four women back into their shells and/or hostilities.jessie ralph has the most fun (moving instead of entirely chewing up thescenery) and katharine alexander has some poignant charm out of herhusband's shadow (and away from his hideous droning). ann harding isunremarkable here (with the production code being enforced). she had anappropriate line in an earlier (pre-code) movie, "when ladies meet": "you'renot worth a minute of one anxious hour that either one of us has given you," but in "enchanted april" can only look hurt, rush out, and proclaim fealty to her errant husband.

i found this to be a tremendously disappointing version of a charming story. i thought the acting was on the whole quite good. reginald owen did chew the scenery, as mentioned by others, but i found him moderately amusing in his brief scenes. tcm has made an ann harding fan of me, and i thought she was fine as usual here. jessie ralph had a field day as the old battleaxe, ordering everybody around, and frank morgan, as always, played frank morgan with a twinkle.for me, the problem was the script and/or the editing--transitions were awkward, motivations were murky. the movie was just too darned short to convey the story properly! i felt completely let down, particularly since i had such fond memories of the later version.

i realize it's a small statistical sampling (8 votes as of this posting), but 5.9 out of 10? i'm giving this movie a 3 and even that's generous. i've tried to watch this movie three times now (the saturday night 9 p.m. premiere on scifi channel, and the saturday night at 1 a.m. and thursday night re-broadcasts) and i've fallen asleep all three times before the movie ends. which leaves me with a laundry list of unanswered questions. for example, is lance henriksen that strapped for cash that he has to keep playing supporting roles in these god-awful "pumpkinhead" sequels? is henriksen contractually banned from doing any non-"pumpkinhead" movies? can't the creators of this franchise do better than a monster that looks like a geriatric, emaciated "alien" who walks like he has a stick jammed up his a**? when are the hick characters in these movies going to realize that handguns and rifles don't hurt the "pumpkinhead?" why don't they try jamming another stick up this thing's a** instead? and, lastly, are the writers of this movie so creatively challenged that they couldn't come up with names for the two feuding families more original than the hatfields and the mccoys? while you're at it, why not write a screenplay about a fictional president and name him george bush? someday i may have the mental stamina to watch this movie all the way through without drifting off to sleep. until then, if somebody has the answers, please let me know.

writer/director michael hurst's sci-fi channel sequel to stan winston's classic horror tale of revenge gone awry has its moments and some decent gore, but ultimately falls short in comparison to the original.i'm pretty sure the filmmakers weren't trying to make a comedy, but i caught myself laughing throughout. a family feud started over a car accident is the basis for this entry into the franchise. the hatfield and mccoy families live in a backwoods town with dirt roads, drive pickup trucks, drink moonshine, and kick each others asses every chance they get. just when they thought it was safe to hate each other and live happily ever after, jodie hatfield (amy manson) and ricky mccoy (bradley taylor) decided to fall in love causing the fit to hit the shan. one night the two lovebirds decide to head out into the woods for some quality time while ricky's sister plays lookout, but it just so happens that on that very night some of the hatfields accidentally kill ricky's sister and catch him and jodie together. you know what happens next. ricky finds his sisters body and decides to pay a visit to haggis so that he can exact his revenge through the mighty pumpkinhead. ye haw! also, harley (lance henriksen) is back to warn potential damned souls against using pumpkinhead to ease their pain. which really put a kink in the story because harley is supposed to have called on pumpkinhead years before this story takes place, but the setting and characters look like dirty pilgrims that somehow traveled through time in order to bring the pickup truck back to plymouth. then there's the sheriff (rob freeman) who has his own ties to the demon and looks like he belongs in a 70's revenge movie instead of a made-for-cable horror flick.some of the gore and special effects were cool, but instead of sticking to the man-in-a-suit way of thinking hurst used some terrible looking 3d shots for certain scenes. one particularly embarrassing shot shows pumpkinhead jumping from tree branches like a badly rendered 3d monkey. the cinematography was exceptional and elevated the quality of the movie quite a bit. the acting was pretty decent also, with the exception of a few poorly executed accents.family feuds never end well, especially when the families involved in the feud have to deal with pumpkinhead. i didn't enjoy every minute of this flick, but it was much better than most of the movies the sci-fi channel spits out. maybe it's a sign that the channel is trying to bring the quality of its movies up to match the quality of its original series'. i wouldn't waste any coin on a rental, but if you get the chance to catch a rerun of it on the boob-tube i would say to check it out. it's a not-so-killer-film but it rises slightly above the level of trash that makes it onto dvd these days.

well they've done it again a new pumpkin head film, the first pumpkin head film was perfect for its time, a dumb, gory, and clichéd monster flick. so heres how it goes, some one loses their loved one, goes to the witch in the woods, gets her to raise pumpkin head and have it murder everyone responsible. unfortunately the film makers have deemed it irrelevant to try and do any other than this, for the films fourth outing, deeming it far more suitable to add some lame romeo and juliet sub plot, involving an idiotic family feud (over a car!!!!) and surprise surprise some gory pumpkin head slayings, so far so formulaic, but it doesn't stop there the acting talent in this flick is dire...oh so bad half of them can't even keep up a southern accent without slipping into their native and often posher accents. lance henrikssen is on board so surely he would bring some gravitas to the movies proceedings...but no lance merely ambles on screen lets the words fall out mouth with absolutely no emotion or seemingly direction, and walks off again, i honestly think he just turned up for the money, then went off to his trailer to drunk and reminisce about aliens.this film is utter cack there is no redeeming feature other than it ending credits which signal its all over.despite the failings of ph:bf...if you want a no brainer that'll make you laugh for all the wrong reasons watch it.if you want something with abit more meat and originality avoid.

pumpkinhead was in itself a decent 80s horror flick. no classic by any means, but an enjoyable piece of fluff. why then, have we now been treated to a fourth film in this franchise is beyond me. as in previous sequels, there's nothing here to really connect the films except for the monster, the witch and ed harley (lance henriksen). this time out we follow the feud between the hatfields and the mccoys. part of the film is a romeo and juliet romance as a young mccoy boy and his hatfield lover decide to run away to be together. soon, however, they are torn apart and the boy's sister is killed. the boy escapes to the woods and gets the witch to resurrect pumpkinhead for some vengeance. the acting is passable at best, amateurish at the worst. the titular demon doesn't even really show up for almost forty minutes and when it does its a pale comparison between it and the original design. overall, blood feud fails to impress. it may be worth a watch once, but certainly not an addition to the collection.

academy awarding actor sidney poitier of "lilies of the field" reprises his role as lieutenant virgil tibbs from the 1967 oscar winning best picture "in the heat of the night" for veteran director gordon douglas' tired, uninspired sequel "they call me mister tibbs," with nobody the equivalent of rod steiger with which to swap dialogue. clearly, both "bullitt" scenarist alan r. trustman and robert d. webb of "cape fear" were off their game when they penned this predictable police procedural potboiler. the dialogue is drab and none of the characters are interesting, not even the chief suspect. absolutely nothing remotely exciting, suspenseful, or surprising occurs in this tame whodunit. meanwhile, things have changed considerably since virgil was last seen in "in the heat of the night." he worked as a homicide detective for the philadelphia, pennsylvania, police department. in "they call me mister tibbs," our hero works for the san francisco police department. moreover, he has a wife, valerie (barbara mcnair of "change of habit"), and a family, a young rebellious son, andy (george spell of "the naked kiss"), and a younger doting daughter, ginger (wanda spell of "hickey and boggs"). tibbs drives a medium blue mustang and his wife holds down the house and hovers over their two children since he doesn't have as much time to spend with them. literally, there are no surprises in this pedestrian murder mystery. indeed, the best thing about "they call me mister tibbs" is quincy jones' terrific orchestral soundtrack with a memorable opening theme, more memorable than this forgettable crime thriller deserved.everything begins sensationally enough with a struggling prostitute, joy sturges (linda towne of "the adventurers"), being bludgeoned to death in the bedroom of her downtown apartment by an unseen assailant. apartment handyman mealie williamson (juano hernandez of "intruder in the dust") enters joy's apartment and finds her strewn on the carpet dead with a bloody forehead. he picks up the statue briefly and then puts it back on the floor and reports joy's death to the superintendent of the apartment, rice weedon (anthony zerbe of "license to kill"), and weedon gives mealie and fistful of dollars and sends him packing. afterward, weedon anonymously notifies the sfpd that popular minister logan sharpe (martin landau of "nevada smith") beaten joy to death and was seem leaving joy's apartment. captain marden (jeff corey of "true grit") assigns tibbs to handle the case; it seems that both tibbs and sharpe have known each other for 18 years. naturally, tibbs' wife valerie cannot believe that the well-known, politically active evangelist could have committed such a crime. just to give the movie context, it should be noted that when tibbs and the police study the crime scene, they mention the word 'semen,' no doubt a controversial term to mention in an early 1970s movie.tibbs questions weedon whom he suspects is either a drug pusher or a pimp. weedon explains that he has no records on joy sturges because she was subletting the apartment from another realty company. tibbs visits the realty company and realtor woody garfield (ed anser of "jfk") flees and drives off, essentially doing an o.j. simpson until he crashes his car after a lengthy but tame pursuit. when tibbs proves that woody didn't kill joy, he allows him to leave, with his disgruntled wife, marge (norma crane of "penelope"), prepared to file for divorce after the revelation that he paid a hooker to stay in an apartment.tibbs tracks down handyman mealie and clears him of the crime, and then he goes after weedon. luckily, for tibbs, our hero catches the evil weedon in the middle of a narcotics transaction. one of weedon's henchmen assaults tibbs, but tibbs dispenses with him briefly before he embarks on a long foot chase after weedon. eventually, he corners weedon in an underground parking garage and they shoot it out. guess who wins.the scenes in the tibbs' household are more interesting than his investigation. andy runs rampant, striking his sister, and smoking in the garden. our hero wants him to clean up his room. when andy refuses, tibbs pops him three times on the jaw. these child rearing scenes could probably never be handled today as they were back in 1970. at the end of the movie, as if to solidify the family sequence, tibbs is seen walking off with his wife and kids. there is on confrontation between valerie and virgil about the welfare of their children and how his long hours at work has affected them.director gordon douglas directs in competent fashion. surprisingly, for a film released in 1970, the filmmakers never play the race card. in one scene, when tibbs searches a billiards parlor owned by an african-american, we see a mixed breed of races scowling at the hero when he finds mealie and leaves with him in tow.altogether, "they call me mister tibbs" is a poor follow-up to "in the heat of the night." mind you, poitier delivers another fine performance with nuance, but everything looks prefabricated. all of the sets look fake and there isn't much physical violence: one underground parking lot shoot-out that doesn't last long and a fight. beyond jones' seminal jazz score, the only surpriseand it really doesn't qualify as a major surprise more like a convenient contrivanceis the ending. donald medford's "the organization" followed "they call me mister tibbs" as the second, more action-packed sequel.

this sequel to "in the heat of the night" will suffer in inevitable comparisons to its infinitely better predecessor. instead of looking like a theatrical movie edited for television, "mister tibbs" looks suspiciously like a tv movie edited for theatrical release, with grainy photography, cheesy opening titles, and sets that look like they're made of plywood. the murder sequence has a glaring continuity error: the camera shows two hands choking the girl, then a shot of a hand reaching for a statuette, then a shot of the girl being choked with two hands again, and finally the statuette coming down for the fatal blow. solving the case should be easy: find the only guy with three hands! but the shoddy production values can't completely obscure this film's considerable merits: namely, sidney poitier's performance as the cool detective determined to follow the evidence wherever it may lead, even if it implicates a friend. martin landau is also convincing as the do-gooder preacher-activist suspected of brutally murdering his prostitute girlfriend. in addition to being haunted by the case, tibbs is conflicted about his home life, but the issues of race and tibbs' barely concealed sense of social outrage are absent here. so is the complex murder mystery that made "in the heat of the night" so compelling.

give h.g. lewis points: he managed to incorporate beefy exotic dancers, gallons of his notorious fake blood, and henny youngman all in one movie. "the gore gore girls" was lewis's horror film swan song, and ends with a head being squashed by an automobile. oh... henny plays a surly night club owner whose girls are falling prey to lewis's standard butchery.

the growth of tax funds and sale-and-leaseback schemes has led to a raft of unsaleable films that are gathering dust in laboratories and vaults all over the british isles because they seem to be made purely because they fit the financial criteria rather than had any potential audience. a lucky few get a week at a small screen in london before going to budget dvd, but the riddle distinguished itself by completely bypassing cinema, tv or even the rental market to premiere as a free gift dvd in the mail on sunday.it's all too easy to see why this ended up being literally given away. aside from a couple of glitches (a boom mike is clearly visible in one shot) it's not particularly badly made, and while vinnie jones comes over like modern british cinema's version of freddie mills mills as the greyhound reporter who wants to move up to the crime desk and the supporting cast veer from ham to vaguely passable, nobody's distinguishing themselves here by being either outstandingly good or outstandingly bad: mediocrity is more the norm here. the real problem is that like so many sale-and-leaseback tax fund films, it's a 'soft' film - there's no reason to watch it. it exists because the circumstances existed for it to be made, but it lacks pace or forward momentum. it seems to be aiming for the sunday teatime telly audience (despite being shot in scope) but doesn't cut it. there are a couple of okayish ideas in this determinedly inoffensive tale of a unpublished charles dickens manuscript and a couple of suspicious deaths in modern-day limehouse, but the mystery element is so painfully obvious - as is the last-minute supernatural twist (you'll never guess who jacobi's literate tramp really is. what, you guessed?) - that you're almost expecting the scooby gang or the double deckers to turn up to solve it.it's a very misconceived film for all kinds of reasons: a few cast members are playing double roles when they shouldn't even be playing one, and the whole shock reveal of the truth of the dickens manuscript is completely bungled because it's all narrated in the first person by dickens rather than the supposed character of the novel. the main murder in the film is clumsily integrated into the main plot, with characters suddenly reminding vinnie that he's forgotten about that one already, heralding an increasingly desperate final half hour that sees wicked developer jason flemyng's secretary puts some rohypnol in vinnie's drink so she can have her wicked way with him and leave incriminating photos behind "to make you look a git with your girlfriend," leading to him having a dream where he talks to charles dickens ("you're charles dickings" "what's in a name?"), who offers the somewhat less than likely suggestion that "you read too many books." but all that's as nothing compared to the finale, which falls into utter absurdity, with logic and common sense going completely out the window as it plays like some bizarre jacobean revenge tragedy with handguns on the banks of the thames, with two-day guest stars flemyng and vanessa redgrave looking like they'd much rather be somewhere else (mel smith turns up in a one-day cameo, so it's clear that the film's 'names' are mainly there for an easy $10k or to meet their alimony payments). the film's final image is so utterly absurd and pointless as to almost make it worth watching, though.one curiosity is a fairly prominent role in the first third for vera day, a sort of prototype liz fraser and one-time mainstay of 50s british films - the barmaid in hell drivers, the barmaid in quatermass ii - here promoted to pub owner, while standup comedian kenny lynch turns up briefly to give the best performance as an old school gangster. oh, and the late gareth hunt makes his last bow as - oh the irony - a coroner...just to round out the package, the freebie dvd also included a trailer for the director's other film with vinnie jones, bog bodies, a naff-looking british horror with transatlantic scientists and vinnie in elmer fudd duck hunter outfit terrorized by a reanimated 2000-year old sacrificial victim from the nearest peat bog ("be wewwy, wewwy qwuiet: i'm hunting dwuids"). i can hardly wait...the one thing i can guarantee, however, is that every indie producer in the uk is going to spend the next few weeks trying to find out exactly how much the mail paid for the license to press the dvd (they paid prince £250,000 for his new cd). with so many british tax-shelter indies on the shelf and with money so hard to find at the moment, this could become an interesting fallback market for british flicks.

ever notice how so many really bad films attract so many 10/10 votes? not much of a riddle how that happens, but this is not much of a film. there are two ways of looking at it being given away in the mail on sunday.1. it's free, so you can't complain about it to much. 2. it's free, so it can't be much good.my vote is number 2. the free dvd in the sunday papers things is a recent trend and some great old movies have been given away. they're ones that have been out for ages and have made most of the money they'll ever make, so it's a case of anything else is a bonus. it's the last stop for old films, not the first for new ones, so you can guess how bad this must be to skip tv and dvd rental.the plus points are that vinnie jones does try hard and derek jacobi is good as dickens. the minus points are a longer list. trying isn't the same as succeeding for poor vinnie and jacobi's other tramp character is talkative ham that's gone off. the story is very weak. the dickens story does not have anything to do with the film's murders and feels like another movie slapped onto the script to make people think it's a british dan brown without the religion. the supporting cast are either there for the money (vanessa redgrave must be really hard up) or because they are friends or girlfriends of the filmmakers. it is also very, very long for what it is.vinnie taking his priceless dickens story with him in his jacket pocket everywhere is good for a couple of laughs, but that's it. not funny and very not good even for free.

a pretty awful film, i'm amazed the likes of derek jacobi & vanessa redgrave agreed to be in it, it's like an overlong episode from a poor tv detective series. the biggest flaw has to be vinnie jones, he simply can't act, whoever had the bright idea of casting him as a leading man wants their head examining unless he put his own money into the project? he should stick to playing thugs, looking menacing & not speaking! also was central heating around in dickens times as there were three big radiators behind his desk??no wonder they gave this away free with a newspaper as no one would pay to see it.

words fail me for this appalling waste of two hours of anyone's life. the story is contrived to the point of complete incredibility. the acting is leaden and so much of this is laughably dreadful. vinnie jones - so wonderful in lock stock and two smoking barrels, is unbearably awful and unbelievable as mike sullivan, journalist.i honestly can't ever remember seeing a worse film. it's only worth watching for the appalling continuity lapses. after jones is handed a huge beating he emerges without a scratch on him. his girlfriend upends a drink over him and he chases her, emerging from the pub bone dry. it's quite dreadful, made all the worse by the talented actors who appear in it.

what more can i add? this is without doubt one of the worst films i've ever seen. terrible acting, a daft script, tediously slow pace - even visible microphones dangling from the top of the screen. i could go on, but i really can't be bothered. i watched this for 90 minutes before the sense of losing the will to live became too great for me.i can only assume that the first set of comments and votes were from people associated with the promotion of this insult to british film-making.and worst still, i had to buy the mail on sunday to get it :-) the only reason the dvd hasn't now been redeployed as a coaster is that it now takes pride of place in my top 10 worst films ever collection.definitely one to be avoided.

well, i got and saw this movie based on the rather high score here (7.1 now), and some of the good reviews. usually imdb is a good guide when it comes to score, though in this case i was very much deceived.the movie is a present-day detective story, with vinnie jones as the investigator journalist, who investigates the death of a construction worker. mixed with this is a made up dickens' novel (called the riddle, set in the 18th or 19th century), which also deals with a murder story. both story lines are connected through the discovery of an unpublished manuscript.sounds interesting? it could have been, however this movie horribly fails in a number of areas : 1) acting. mediocre at best, but it is watchable. no worse than your average uk sitcom, though for a movie one expects a little better. especially with a score of over 7. 2) music. the music used is simply horrible, it distracts and it is annoying. especially the pub music, and the music which plays in the journalist's apartment. 3) storyline. this is a big joke. there are gaping plot holes everywhere and even the obligatory love story is so unrealistic that it's almost funny. furthermore, without going into any detail, i can safely say that the ending is absurd, and one of the worst pieces of acting and storyline of the year. 4) camera-work. at times camera positions and views are distracting, and serve absolutely no purpose to the "story".i'm a bit of a movie fanatic, and watch on average 1 to 2 movies a day, but this is easily the worst movie i've seen in months. don't waste your money or your time on this rubbish.

flatland is one of my favorite books, thus i was looking forward to this film. unfortunately, the film is absolutely horrible. the dialog is so bad it sounds like improv half the time. the new storyline makes me think they took the book and a couple of newspapers, threw them in a blender and used what came out for the screenplay. it's a disgrace to the book and independent film making. the only reason i even managed to get all the way through the film was my hopes that it'd get better. unfortunately, it only got worse, climaxing in a really retarded ending.that's not to say everything about the movie is bad. the cg is acceptable, in a 1990's "reboot" sort of way which i assume is what they were going for. and i suppose you can't go wrong with "people" getting chopped in half and gushing blood all over the place.

nickelodeon has gone down the toilet. they have kids saying things like "oh my god!" and "we're screwed"this show promotes hate for people who aren't good looking, or aren't in the in crowd. it say that sexual promiscuity is alright, by having girls slobbering over shirtless boys. not to mention the overweight boy who takes off his shirt. the main characters basically shun anyone out of the ordinary. carly's friend sam, who may be a lesbian, beats the snot out of anybody that crosses her path, which says it's alright to be a b**ch. this show has so much negativity in it that nobody should watch it! i give it a 0 out of 10!!!

miranda cosgrove is known for her debut in "school of rock" with jack black and her role as megan in the show "drake and josh" and she has become a fan favorite amongst the nickelodeon public, so it isn't a surprise that dan schneider would create a show just for her. unfortunately, it ends up being as bad as, if not worse than, "the amanda show"."icarly" is about three friends, carly, sam, and freddie, who have become idols in the junior high community through a webcam show called "icarly". carly and sam are the hosts and freddie shoots and puts it up on the internet. carly also has an older brother named spencer, acted by the hilarious jerry trainor who is known for his work in "drake and josh" as crazy steve.well, let me tell you this. don't believe the 8.3 out of 10 this show received because it is pathetic in nearly every aspect. dan schneider probably went through about 5 minutes of studying teenage interests because all i see is him saying "ipod? iphone? ihome? aha! teenagers love anything beginning with 'i'!" and a majority of gigs that were used in "drake and josh", if not, then they are just really dry and forced jokes that don't even count on a generousity chuckle, such as "you want me to turn up the ac to 60 degrees?" "no. we want you to turn it up to 60 pickles!" not only that, but if you look closely, nearly all the sets in the shows were used in "drake and josh" and "ned's declassified" that were simply spit-and-polished with random stuff to try and make it look different.the scenes where the show is showing a broadcast of the icarly network is just as terrible as the entire series itself. the dialogue in them is atrociously bad, which may be accepted by some since it is just two friends playing around in front of a camera, but what's the deal with the really odd, humorless antics they do like "random dancing!"? and it just gets worse from there.in terms of acting, miranda and jennette aren't at their best, by far. nathan kress, who played freddie, isn't believable at times, but he does an okay job. the person who really steals the show is the humorous prowess of jerry trainor, who fits in his "protective older brother" role very well and his wide-eyed loud-mouthed acting can make for some pretty funny segments. too bad they aren't frequent, because that might have given the show an extra star in my opinion.dan schneider must have made this show for the sole purpose of giving miranda cosgrove her own cable-born playground to hop around and spew unfunny jokes and pathetic cue-card lines in every direction, because everyone else has exceptional talent buried underneath the poorly-done script and weightless acting. dan schneider did a great job with "drake and josh" so it's a real disappointment that "icarly" is such a failure. jerry trainor's acting saved this show from a 1 out of 10 rating, but he alone can't save "icarly" from being as horrible as it is.

icarly is all that's wrong with the world. all the main characters but carly's brother and freddy are morally bankrupt.sam damages other people on whim. she breaks a kids locker and he is forced to pay a 100 dollars to fix it, and all she says is "tough luck" and moves on to smash freddy's cellphone. she just caused at least 300 dollars worth of damage and she is more focused on getting some food. what the hell?. the only time she's every felt guilt is when she made fun of freddy on the show. and that's only cause carly nagged the crap out of her.carly is the "i'm perfect, everything i do is nice." type of girl. everything she does is for her own benefit and she is often shown only having remorse for herself. what's worse, she encourages sam's crap. sam ruins some of freddy's clothes? she laughs. sam ruins a kids grades? she shrugs it off.don't even get me started on the humour. the laugh track is played at every moment.sam: he's not that hot carly: yes he is sam: yeah you're right *insane amount of laughter*the shows humour consists around degrading others and saying obscure words and occasionally bantering on about trivial matters using similar sentences.not to mention all the 'super cool special techno effects' they do can be done in windows movie maker.

first off... i have to say acting isn't very good. miranda cosgrove is the main character but is not such a good actress quite frankly. spencer, her brother is a way much better actor. spencer is easily my favorite character because he probably is the only one that knows how to act. carly on the other hand tries to act her heart out but... sorry, it just isn't good. sam doesn't even get credit, i mean come on... icarly... pretty self centered eh? freddy isn't bad, i don't have a comment. i must add that carly and her puppet sam change their attitude whenever they go to film a web cast, they go shouting out all their lines.it's sorta bad influence in a way because carly has a web show and if kids will copy this, they might be giving their own information and that not pretty safe.the only nice things is that it has some funny parts of the show which makes it entertaining. at least this show isn't boring, it has nice plots, pretty strong. many kids will like this because they don't look for flaws.overall this is a bad show but it's not boring.

first of all, i'd like to say i am a teenager so this is all marketed towards me, and i can safely say that icarly very poor programing, and the fact that it's accepted among both genders baffles me. it contains some of the worst attempts at comedy i've ever witnessed with mediocre acting to boot. the supposed humor within the show is all based on saying someone's lines again with poor sarcasm, poor sarcasm, saying bad one-liners, and, well, you get the picture. also, i should mention that i do still watch spongebob, which i know i'll get a negative backlash for, but that's quality programming with some honestly funny moments in it, less we forget something icarly's missing; wit. the show's about a young girl, carly, putting on a web-show with her friends, which i can say is without a doubt a nicer version of the internet. that's fine, but the show's just...well, not funny at all, as previously stated. if this is what children's programming has come to today, parents, show them something that's actually funny; spongebob or rocco's modern life would work.also, compared to it's brothering show, drake & josh, it's terrible, which was implied. seriously, please watch something worthwhile. even for a children's show it's poor.

the actresses bra in a changing room--well i guess they are preparing young children for changing room time? (boys you must close your eyes at that scene a humongous bra (34c which definitely neither of the actresses size) dangling and supposedly talking--oh don't worry if your son takes your bra then stripping boys (a girl pulls down a boys pants) to reveal his boxers--kids try that at home and in school beating a girl with male briefs--nothing wrong. the show likes to show underwear--panties next?? actress--at an age below 18 in a revealing bikini--mom can you buy me one when i reach puberty? so many sexual innuendos to learn:eg: "don't doubt my ball skills.""i like to dance. with my shirt off.""wet and sticky is very icky. sticky and wet make mommy upset.""i just wanna stick my face in this pie and go 'bbbbbbuuuub.'""i come up with my best ideas when i'm wet.""he sliced my banana!""come on boy, let's do it"you'll never guess where i found this fish""i'll leave you two to do..it""carly (about sam): she just ditched icarly to go play with jonah?!""you won't get respect if your back's not erect.""how's it hanging""what can i say, i'm a great ball handler""watch me spank your daddy!"spencer: that's big. freddie's mom: thank you"hey! could you keep your hands off my equipment?"freddie: oh, and last night, slept with my socks on. sam or carly: so? freddie: just my socks"they wanted no part of me or my fudgeballs""freddie, you know how i feel about you handling tools!""you don't even wanna know where the batteries go""it's like she stuffs waffle cones in her bra!"spencer: "well, it spread...to places." freddie: "where?" *spencer motions for freddie to come near, then whispers in his ear.* freddie: "ugh!""wow, it's just that you've always seemed . . . so willing.""i have to take my daughter to a special doctor""i send a lot of guys, a lot of places""yeah, you've been having all kinds of fun this morning.""i'm looking for some 'cheap entertainment'..." (mom i learn how to say **** indirectly today!!) all in all very educational for young children. lesson to be taken: if you want to know more than where babies come from kids, watch this show!!!

first off acting is so terrible except for the actor who plays spencer. mirinda cosgrove does not deserve her own show she should have stick with drake and josh.the only person i like besides spencer is nevel hes super bad@$$ he kicked carlys crews @$$ and i liked itthe episode i hate a lot is imyourbigesstfan i hate that young icaly fan she made me almost kill myself fake is a well word to describe this please don't watch this nothing on tv is good go with classics like family matters good show ban icarly lets all go back to doug nick version only please don't watch i hate icarly oh also nathan kress is a wannabee fredie highmore

the first time i watched this show it was ok. there were some funny moments and i laughed a couple of times but this show is getting worse and worse. carly and sam's web show is not the least bit funny. they play a stupid video from the internet, scream at the camera and make some very bad jokes. and then the laugh track goes off?! one problem with the show is that none of the main characters are funny. carly is not funny. miranda cosgrove's acting is lackluster at best. her acting in this show is nothing like her acting from drake and josh. her friend sam is very rude and crude and the show is written in a way that makes her look like some kind of hillbilly. i mean they make jokes about her mom driving a rusty old truck, her mom smashing an old tv with a bat, and then there's the jokes about sam failing in school, getting detention all the time and running from cops. none of that is funny at all. then there's freddy who is a computer geek. he isn't too funny unless his mom is treating him like a baby. the show's only somewhat funny full time character is carly's brother spencer. he makes some funny jokes and does some pretty funny things like pretending to drive a space ship while making spaceship noises, knocking over a girl scouts' cookie table for revenge as they did the same thing to him. his material is the only thing worth laughing at. aside from the characters other things make the show bad too. like the fact that a couple of kids doing a local web show from a seattle apartment is a worldwide hit and got them a free trip to tokyo? another thing is that how can a 26 year old single guy with no real job can pay for a 2 level apartment in downtown seattle and raise his 13 year old sister and pay for a room full of camera and sound equipment including a remote controlled projector and a green screen and an hd camera? this sounds like it was written by a 10 year old. the worst thing is that the show contains some pretty questionable content. there are a couple of times when carly(remember a 13 year old girl) appears on her internet web show in a bikini top. wtf? then i saw an episode where freddy tells carly and sam that he "slept in just his socks the night before." i mean wtf? then there's an episode where carly's rival nevel blackmails her by taking her website rights and agrees to give her the website back in exchange for a kiss. creepy! and i just saw an episode where carly meets a boy who just moved into their apartment building and he has some kind of back injury and he takes off his shirt and carly stands there drooling over him. i can't believe nick even lets them show that kind off stuff and i can't believe that this was created by the same guy responsible for drake and josh. this show is not appropriate for kids under the age of 12 and that's even questionable. icarly is just another addition to the long list of awful nick programming.

icarly is about a teenage girl named carly shay (miranda cosgrove) who lives with her artist brother, spencer in a loft in seattle. carly has a web show that gets millions of views and makes tons of money a year, so much money she "doesn't even know its a real number". her best friend is sam (janette mccrudy) who's as predictable as they come! she says "normal" things and beats up carly's neighbor, freddie who is in charge of all the technical things for their web show. carly shouts every word and looks like she doesn't have emotion. sam chases freddie around and freddie screams. in one episode carly and her friends shoot lewbert (the doorman) down in elevator and he survives.i would not recommend this at all, unless you like teenagers shouting, hurting people and making fun of stuff.

ever went on youtube? well, the definite question to that is yes. do you see the boatloads of icarly and nickelodeon rants? no definite answer.many people think icarly is a dull and idiotic program, and others think it's the best program on the face of the earth. i have seen many of the loads of reviews panning icarly in the head and some giving it a bouquet of roses. in my opinion, icarly is for the kiddies, but the show is just awful.if you did not read the last review, here are reasons 1-8: #1: steryotypes #2: goofed-up drama #3: everything is silly(taco truck for example) #4: carly thinks she's nice but she's mean #5: anyone over the drinking age is stupid #6: sam is petite but strong? #7: no real companies #8: mean teachers#9: the webshow overuses 3dfx. just look on the webshow to understand what i mean. #10: the webshow also spills personal information. #11: almost every famous thing is insulted. icarly insults the japanese race, solitare, mercades-benz, and pac-man, to name a few. #12: there are too many reoccuring jokes(sam's obsession of meat, freddy's computer, gibby pulling his shirt off, etc.) #13: the video games based off the show suck. #14: freddy has a lack of masculinity. why? it's getting unoriginal. #15: the show is targeted towards a female audience. i also hate shows directed to a male audiences too, so i prefer icarly to be for both genders. #16: the words "nub" and "no chiz". #17: the overuse of laugh tracks.part 3 coming in early spring! just in time for spring break!

i watched the halloween episode...oh my god i wanted to die. the acting was just awful. the lines were uttered with absolutely no conviction. its a bad idea for a show as well, i mean who would watch some web show like that in real life? miranda cosgrove was great in a supporting role in drake and josh but doesn't have the force of character to anchor her own show. i'm even more upset because her leaving is a major reason why drake and josh ended. she was approached with her own show...she jumped ship on drake and josh. they then decided that maybe they would do a thing with drake and josh moving to college, thereby explaining the loss of meagan as a character but drake had already had thoughts of moving on to bigger and better things and he figured if miranda did it why couldn't he. the best part of the show was the theme song... a catchy, good tune in a mire of mediocrity. of course drake bell was dubbing miranda's voice for the whole thing and wrote the tune...

out of boredom and vast curiosity, i decided to check this show out today since my four year old niece loves it. i should have known that it was a show that only a four year old could like. the show was pretty bad.first of all, the show just wasn't funny. the laugh track went off at the most inappropriate times which was very annoying, especially since none of the jokes were funny. the laugh track went off at some point when the one kid who's the cameraman said "i'm going to go polish my lense". how the hell is that funny? the parts in it (like meat drumming) that were supposed to be funny was just stupid to anyone who's over the age of eleven.now, i have a feeling that four year olds are not the target audience. however, since i have a four year old niece who watches it, this sort of thing concerned me while i was watching it: it doesn't show very good behavior. in the episode i was watching, it shows sam stealing carly's sandwich and pushing her down to the ground, just so carly can stand up and do the same thing back to her. i would not want to see my niece acting that rude. i also don't like the idea of two young girls having a web show where they give out personal information... if this was real, there would be freaks all over her.this show would probably be good and funny to someone who's eleven or younger, but anyone older than that, just stay away from it. i'll give this two stars since i guess i can see how it can be funny to a kid.

this show is just plain awful. i liked to watch drake and josh, which was great, and before that the amanda show, also funny, but this is just awful. in my opinion watching this felt like watching those --- movies from seltzberg, painful and uncleaver. this is about 3 dumb@$$ kids who make a crappy web-show (while stealing the hole ithing) while their retarded brother is making sculptures (he has no life). the cast is crap, megan from drake and josh is carly (ahhhhhh!)a ugly b!tch is sam and some kid they pulled off the street plays fred. all i saw from this (ugg) are random "jokes" that include the brother making a clay-mation film, he also played an arcade game called pac-rat (genious), sam and carly being retards on their web show, and fred being a dork. the only episode a saw (cant remember the title) where fred gets bad luck by not forewarding an email.i find videos on youtube funnier than this junk. and why the hell do they get youtube jack@$$ fred, get avgn to cancel the show with his potty mouth. just skip this show.

again, like many other tv shows, a certain actor/actresses in thrust into the limelight, in this case miranda cosgrove, having built up her reputation in previous movies/series (especially by nickelodeon and dan schneider. she is now the star of the show, gets to sing the soundtrack ( which she did not write and thus gets even more fame from that). wonderful? it creates as much imbalance in popularity vs her other co-stars, especially nathan kress, who is continually thrust into minor rolls in each episode, except idont want to fight. cosgrove's music would never have met the charts without this show and her singing the main theme song (which was not written by her) and other covers such as about you now and stay my baby. let's not forget that she lip sync/sings her song live too. is that how you create vocalist nowadays?back to the show, cosgrove reveals more physically by acting scenes in a bikini, hawaiian hula type bra and mentioned bra many times through out. bras and seen in many cases (though not of the other actresses). wedgies are mentioned, panties have been mentioned once. og let us not forget "oh my god" a come phrase (are any of the scriptwriters/actors christian?) granted that the show is not meant to be just for kids, i'm surprised at the multitude of mentions of the female undergarment, especially in the first episode, where the phrase "pointy boobs" were mentioned. i'm not sure whether kids would thus refrain from saying that at home/in school afterwards. it's not that i'm against the mentioning or showing of female undergarments (which girls will wear), but for a show from nickelodeon, the people in charge should have realised that kids would get the exposure to such stuff. i doubt that other nickelodeon shows have such content in them.as mentioned is other reviews, the laughter track is extremely annoying and unnecessary in many parts--for example, when the character sam cries, how on earth is that a time to laugh? it distracts people from getting the joke and is used almost in every sentence.as mentioned, cosgrove is made the star of the show and thus gains the utmost fame and support from die hard fans, who even scolded a hotel staff when she is told to keep her noise level down (see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk0gtfuk98u). jennette mccurdy is the second star of the show but she faces competition from cosgrove in the music industry (compare the popularity of her new single vs cosgrove's covers). as noted, the third co-star nathan kress is the least noted of the lot. he is portrayed as a atypical boy who suffers the brunt of bullying by a girl and other boys but somehow a wizard at technology. his height in early episodes make him a cute actor but unusual given his character's crush on carly/cosgrove. beyond that, kress isn't breaking into the music industry and as cosgrove's fame grows with each episode, kress falls behind. i would bet that he is the least paid of all the three actors.the content of the show is of course fictional, but also lets one wonder how it fits into a comedy series at certain times (thus the laughter track is used).it also contains several continuity errors (how can your father be and air force colonel on a submarine? us special forces have their own branches, and the air force doesn't use us submarines--that is for seals). a unique feature is that of allowing viewers to submit their own videos to be shown during or after the episodes, but again the videos somehow do not meet the theme of comedy.once again, it is a show that is riddled with mentions of the female undergarments, exposure of skin, and over used laughter tracks. it is a series which thrusts a teen actress so far into the crowd such that her songs/actions are excessive supported by her fans, leaving her co stars behind.

first off, i just want to say that this show could've done well, way better than it's doing now. what brought it down was certainly the acting. miranda cosgrove, who acts as the main character carly, looked almost worthy of her own show when she was on drake and josh. unfortunately, icarly was a big let down. not only can miranda not act convincingly enough, but she's incredibly stiff when she moves. she looks as if she's not sure how the character "carly" would move or stand. in the very first episode at the end when she throws the hat up, her arm doesn't ever leave her side from her elbow up. even when she was dancing she looked like a stick in the breeze. and the singing? the theme song was great, only because drake had been in it, the music was pretty good and miranda's voice sounded fake. i have to admit, the plot and settings are good, unrealistic, but hey, that's nick. they're practically known for stupid lines and characters. but wow, is icarly the worst of them all.

honestly, buying this movie was a waste of money. it's one of the most boring movies i have seen in my life. the only part i liked is the ending, but it's so slow that not even the fantastic ending can save this movie.

it's nice to see julie andrews trying a straight dramatic role here--something she hadn't done in awhile--but her character of judith(wise they didn't try to pass her off as a 'judy')has the old refined manners and tomboyish hairstyle of yore, and andrews enacts 'grown-up' as any other actress would interpret frigid. it's a surprisingly bland drama set in barbados involving omar sharif(not the liveliest leading man around--not even in 1974!)hoping to make andrews a spy while also slowly leading her into the proverbial bedroom. unmemorable outing does have some camp value: the james bond-like credits at the beginning are a cheesy hoot. as for julie: she's quiet and contemplative, but that doesn't do much for the audience, or for the film. blake edwards paces the freakin' thing like a funeral. * from ****

you know that this film is in serious trouble when the best acting job is the support role played by arnold schwarzenegger. while this was still relatively early in his career and he wasn't the best actor, compared to brigitte nielsen, he's sir john gielgud. in fact, this film proves that the only reason she got much of any attention were her boobs and because she was involved with the incredibly self-destructive football player, mark gastineau. so, instead of this being her "break out film", this and a beverly hills cop movie mark about as high as she went in her one-note career. it was obvious, too, that the financing wizards gave up on this movie as well, because the supporting cast (aside from arnold) is pretty lame and the script is dull, dull, dull. fans looking for another conan movie would no doubt be very disappointed in this slow and uninvolving film.

corny and some really bad acting but for a golan-globus film about right on par. saw this movie back in 1985 mostly because i liked sword and sorcery films(what was i thinking?). arnold is in it playing a high lord trying to make sure an ancient talisman is destroyed before it blows up the world.brigitte nielsen is the title character who at the time was sly's girl and a pretty bad actress.movie producers like to cast playboy type women who cant act in low budget b movies. brigitte cheeses it up as sonya and arnold acts wooden as lord kalidor.there is also sandahl bergman(who was in the original conan movie as valeria)here she plays the evil queen gedren,an obvious camp to her conan role. and then one of the most irritating child actors onscreen(ernie reyes)as prince tarn who should have been slapped hard and sent to bed.what a little irritating scut. some of the swordfights arent too bad but the music really sucks. special effects are cheap and look very 70's ,like the explosion of the evil queen's castle at the climax of the movie. overall a very low par film but b movie film buffs might like it for its campiness.

after a long hard night being partied away at the walkabout in islington, i needed a pick-me-up. my throat hurt, my wallet was empty and i ended up chatting to a drug addict at a bus-stop trying to sell me some petrol. today, i watched "red sonja" and i can honestly say that i felt much better last night than i do right now. brigitte nielsen leads a bunch of ass-kicking warriors in various shapes and sizes to recover a green rock from some evil queen whose motives are never fully explained. yep, it's that good."red sonja" isn't in a genre known for great films until peter jackson came along with a certain oscar-winning trilogy. in fact, the best swords-and-sorcery film i could think of before "lord of the rings" was george lucas's kiddie-friendly "willow". perhaps, in view of this, one should go a little easy on this film. but i can't - it's poorly written, badly acted (with the exception of paul smith, who's just average) and dreadfully put together. the film is as convincing as an episode of the flintstones, with costumes and scenery seemingly lifted straight outta bedrock. considering the comic-book source material, it is easy to forgive the various plot inconsistencies. why sonja insists on saving the most annoying kid, in this world or that one, is bewildering. his personality seems to flick from spoilt brat to polite gentleman at the flick of a switch. schwarzenegger displays less charisma than a field full of cows and just goes through the motions, a perfect actor for his breakthrough role in "the terminator".it's simple to kick a film when you're down but the fact remains that this is not a good film, by any stretch of the imagination. when nielsen mourns the death of her sister and schwarzenegger tenderly places his hand on her shoulder to comfort her and then blurts out, in that distinctive germanic accent, "she's dead" then you know you're in for a rough ride. a few smiles were raised at inappropriate points, such as the priestesses of a temple who, when sent plunging to their deaths in a hole in the ground, seemed to enjoy the experience - at least, judging from the orgasmic moans that seemed to echo around the place. if you have to watch an eighties fantasy film that wasn't porn, watch "willow" (but never take that as a ringing endorsement). for the real thing, take yourself to your local multiplex and show peter jackson what a great job he did with "lord of the rings". trust me, 11 oscars really does mean it's a great film - unlike bloody "titanic".

possible spoilers as peter jackson has so brilliantly shown in his `lord of the rings' trilogy, it is quite possible to make good films, even great ones, within the heroic fantasy genre. the genre has distinguished literary antecedents, dating back to the mediaeval chivalric romances, particularly the arthurian legends, upon which tolkien and other authors have drawn. `lord of the rings' apart, however, it is difficult to think of any other sword-and-sorcery films which are any good. i would agree with the reviewer who said that the best of a bad bunch was ron howard's `willow', and even that achieved little distinction other than that of being a merely mediocre film as opposed to a positively bad one. `red sonja', however, cannot achieve the even more modest distinction of being simply a bad film as opposed to an appalling one.as with `willow', many of the plot-elements in `red sonja' are derived from `the lord of the rings'. an evil ruler seeks to gain control of an artefact with supernatural powers in order to achieve an ambition of world domination, but is thwarted by an assorted group of heroes. the film, set in the hyborian age, a barbaric era in the earth's remote past, starts with the villain of the piece, the wicked queen gedren, making unwelcome sexual advances to the heroine sonja. when these are rebuffed, gedren (not a woman to take no for an answer) reacts by murdering sonja's parents and brother. (in 1985 it was presumably still considered politically correct not only to make the chief villain a woman but also to make one of the main motives for her villainy frustrated lesbian lust).gedren's next move is to capture the talisman, a sort of fluorescent green soccer ball with magical powers, by slaughtering the whole of the scantily-dressed female priesthood charged with protecting it, just as they are about to destroy it because they feel its powers have become too dangerous. among the dead is sonja's sister, her sole surviving relative. sonja herself, however, has not been idle, but has enrolled in a martial arts academy from which she graduates summa cum laude, and sets out to avenge herself. along the way she teams up with kalidor, a heroic wandering swordsman-king resembling tolkien's aragorn, prince tarn, the spoilt child-ruler of a kingdom that has fallen to gedren's powers, and falkon, tarn's loyal servant. the rest of the film is fairly predictable, as sonja and her allies try to overthrow gedren and prevent the destruction of the world threatened by the out-of-control talisman.just what is it that makes this film so bad? well, the acting, for a start. arnold schwarzenegger as kalidor gives the sort of typical wooden, poker-faced performance that became his trademark, at least in the early part of his career, complete with heavy foreign accent. compared with brigitte nielsen as the heroine, however, he looks like laurence olivier. miss nielsen seems to have had even worse language difficulties, delivering every line in the mechanical, toneless voice of someone who has just completed lesson three of a `teach-yourself-english-by-correspondence' course. one wonders if she was hired for the role just to make arnie look good by comparison. the other characters, while not conducting their own private struggles against the english language, are simply cartoonish caricatures, especially prince tarn who must be one of the most obnoxious screen youngsters ever.an even worse fault than the bad acting, however, is the film's almost complete lack of imagination. this is a particularly glaring fault in a fantasy film, as films of this genre need to rely on their imaginative power in order to persuade the audience to suspend the natural feelings of disbelief that would be provoked by a fantastic plot. when we watch peter jackson's masterpiece we can persuade ourselves, at least for the next three hours, that we are in middle-earth, that elves, wizards and hobbits do exist, and that the fate of the world really does depend upon the destruction of a magic ring. when we watch `red sonja' we are persuaded of nothing except that we are watching a bunch of actors with bad accents fighting one another on a hillside for possession of a lime-green football.this lack of imagination even starts with the film's title. the british science-fiction author brian aldiss, when challenged about the exotic names given to his characters, replied that there was little point in creating a fictional alien society with its own distinctive culture if you were going to spoil the effect by calling the hero joe. (admittedly, tolkien was ableto get away with giving the name sam to one of his main characters, but that was because hobbits were supposed to be reassuringly familiar, the middle-earth equivalent of tweedy, pipe-smoking englishmen). similarly, giving the heroine of a tale ostensibly set in a long-gone barbaric age a common girls' name like `sonia' (which is how the name `sonja' is pronounced) is about as appropriate as calling her `betty' or `mary-jane'.the film seems to have been made on a very small budget, which makes me wonder why they bothered at all. fantasy needs to be done convincingly, or not at all. it was obviously shot in a remote mountain area, with little or no attempt to suggest a distinctive culture. the few buildings we see, such as the temple of the talisman or gedren's palace, are obviously cheap sets. we learn that tarn's capital city has been destroyed by gedren using the power of the talisman, but we do not actually see this event; all we see is what might be a thunderstorm taking place on the other side of a hill. at first you wonder how sonja intends to overthrow an entire kingdom with only a few allies, but when you see how small an army gedren has at her disposal it becomes more understandable. when an earthquake threatens to destroy the palace, you wonder if this is the talisman at work or merely a crew member inadvertently leaning against the set. if we can enjoy this film for nothing else, we can at least enjoy it for its inadvertent humour; a fine example of the so-bad-it's-funny school of filmmaking. ed wood would have been proud of this one. if it had been shown on californian television the night before the recall election, gray davis would still be governor. 2/10.

i remember the trailer for this infamously weak spin-off of conan. i saw the movie years later and laughed my head off. unintentionally! poor briggite nielson. her career never had a chance thanks to cobra and red sonja. the plot of the movie is this: sonja(brigitte nielson) hails from a tribe of female warriors who were killed off by an evil queen gedren(sandahl bergman). queen gedren steals the orb the female warriors were protecting and uses it to destroy each town she passes by. sonja goes on a hunt for queen gedren and later finds out that gedren killed her parents. on her quest she reluctantly joins kalidor(arnold schwarzenegger), an arrogant prince named tarn(ernie reyes jr.) and his bumbling idiotic servant, falkon(paul l. smith). together they go on a hunt for queen gedren and the orb. the acting is sub par and the action scenes are soso. i mean briggite neilson looks so emotionally distant. for someone who lost her whole family as well as her female comrades, sonja doesn't look fazed at all. arnold is playing his usual stoic role and ernie reyes jr.... what an annoying snot-nosed brat he was in this movie! the moronic manservant falkon had more personality than these guys. the action scenes are the only redeeming moments of the movie even though sometimes they fall flat. the scene where they fight the mechanical sea creature made me laugh till my ribs ached. the dialog is a hoot also. its as if the screenwriter thought that nobody was going to take the movie seriously so he gave everybody stupid lines to work with. i can only recommend this movie to you if you like your epic movies extra campy. anyone else don't bother.

honestly, this movie is weak. very weak. only capital character can something. she's work like supercharger on bad engine...so, if you like red-haired valkyries - see that. but better find picture of brigitte as sonja and put it on desktop. it will save of disappointments. well, arnold also do his deal...but it definitely not best his role. other characters - bad is not that word. sword fights? monsters? ridiculous. plot is really shame. why was necessary rape she? especially, we don't see it.anyway movie is weak. though worse movies exist...without main characters it would be just ******. and if somebody even discusses it, maybe...

okay, i admit i like brigitte neilsen in an unhealthy way, i just have a thing for 6' tall women with swords. there i said it.what's wrong with the movie? just about every mistake you can make was made. you take a successful movie series (conan) and you drag it through the mud with a bad script, bad casting, bad effects, and the worst thing of all...you put a cute kid in there for comic relief. this kind of thing almost killed the indiana jones series ya know. cute kids are for disney movies, not real movies. neilsen at least took the movie seriously, even though it seems nobody else did. the plot had schwarzenegger repeatedly pulling red sonja's fat out of the fire and that undercut her character considerably. a warrior woman doesn't need a dude to get her out of a mess, thats her job! to not re-use the conan character in this movie was a crime. kalidor? sheesh. the movie never set the proper mood and its pacing was rather disjointed and sloppy, unlike conan the barbarian which had multiple story lines that flowed gracefully. when it comes to fantasy movies, its okay to have cheesy costumes, its okay to have harryhausen style animation, its okay to have silly exorbitant sets that make no sense, but to have a horrible script is unforgivable.this movie could have been a classic, but the script felt like it was written by a 12 year old.

recap: since the warrior queen gedren raised and slaughtered most of sonja's family, she has trained in the art of sword fighting. now, gedren has taken a very powerful talisman, that threatens to destroy the world if not destroyed, killing sonja's sister in the process. now sonja is out for revenge, and to save the world. along the way, she meets the very conan-like (but not conan, no!) kalidor, the child-prince tarn and his bodyguard falcon. at first sonja declines all help, but is later forced to accept it, and together they go to save the world.comments: when you watch a movie like this, and you think that it is the story that the is the best element in this movie, the movie is in big trouble. because 1) a movie like this should draw its strength upon good swordfights and effects, and 2) the story is really, really bad. it is simple, and uncomplicated and really offers nothing in way of character development or even suspense. it is predictable and boring, and the obvious couple, sonja and kalidor, has no chemistry at all. and the kid is just annoying. and most of the scenes is drawn out so long that they become boring. though the movie is not very long, it has not material enough to fill its time. and so back to point 1). the fighting is slow, uneventful and really bad. it clearly shows most fighters clearly blocking the opponents strokes far ahead of the opponent has even begun to strike. in my honest opinion, i believe most kids, fighting with sticks, creates more exciting fights playing knights than this movie did. all in all, this is a really bad spin-off, that should be avoided by all who liked the conan-movies.2/10

... when dubbed into another language. let's face it: neither nielsen nor schwarzenegger are really good actors when it comes to dialog. and given the campy lines they are supposed to utter this is a loose-loose situation. any type of voice-over is sure to be an improvement (and it actually is - at least in the german version).but that is only a minor point. the acting is bad. the speeded up combat sequences are pathetic. nielsen couldn't use her sword to fight her way out of a wet paper bag. this becomes painfully obvious when compared to the fluidity of motion exhibited by the kid (who has had some martial arts training, no doubt) and to the athleticism shown off by sandahl bergman.schwarzenegger does his conan thing - nothing new here.some of the visuals are nice, i'll have to grant that. the dragon skeleton bridge looks cool. but more often than not the plaster is all too evident.overall the movie isn't worth seeing. even 'conan the destroyer' is better than this (although only marginally). i would have much rather seen bergman as red sonja as she was originally supposed to be, but i doubt that that could have saved this movie - oh well.3/10

this film was released soon after the conan films, a sort of female conan, red sonja played by sylvester stallones ex-wife brigitte nielsen. she's not a very good actress unfortunately as proved in rocky iv and cobra. the whole film feels cheap, but strangely arnold swarzenegger appears in this film but not as conan, although he looks, acts and fights like conan from the two conan films, i don't know what thats about. anyway he only appears about every twenty minutes and doesn't hang around for long. maybe arnold filmed this in his time off from filming conan the destroyer or something? anyway the film is way to slow and boring for an action film, skip this and watch conan the barbarian instead.

this, in my opinion, is a very poor movie that advertises arnold schwarzenegger as starring (despite him being the co-star) only to sell more copies. obviously taking influence from the similarly themed conan' movies, this film fails to prove as enjoyable and eventually fails to entertain at all.bridgette neilsen stars as sonja, a beautiful woman who has been given unbelievable strength by a ghostly figure after her village was pillaged, her family killed and she herself raped by the soldiers of queen gedran (sandahl bergman). gedran is a tyrant queen who wants control over the barbaric world and seeks out a talisman protected by sonja's sister to do it. after discovering what has happened sonja sets out for revenge and at the same time she must save the world from the wrath of gedran. kalidor (schwarzenegger), the master of the talisman, sets out to protect her whether she wants him there or not.the first major problem with this movie is the beginning. the events leading up to the point where sonja receives her powers could have easily made a good ten to fifteen minutes of enjoyable film. however, the beginnings are rushed into what seems like a quick one-minute `previously on.' segment from a television show. had they actually made these events part of the story and cut out some of the filler later on they may have been able to start redeeming this movie but unfortunately they didn't (i wonder why director richard fleischer has only currently directed two movies since red sonja).this film also features some of the most annoying characters in history like tarn (ernie reyes jr.) who is a stupid character and just adds an over abundance of camp to the movie, which sometimes works but in this case fails miserably. he was quite obviously written into the movie for some comic relief but with the overall absurdity of the film anyway this was another costly mistake for red sonja'.for all it's faults there were some good fight scenes involving both neilsen and arnie which are worth noting but these are nowhere enough to save this turkey. the acting is about as good as it gets for movies of this quality and even arnie didn't seem too bothered about his performance. i don't recommend this film at all; to me it's a waste of an hour and a half. my rating for red sonja'  3/10

i figure the company that made this movie wanted people to think of the conan movies, but unfortunately for the ones who made this one it does just that. you will be thinking, man the conan movies were pretty cool...this one is totally boring and sucks. the story, who cares? it isn't going to help you like this movie more or less as it just seems like a really cheap film. arnold, doesn't look like he belongs in this one, why he agreed to play the role is beyond me. well probably for the money. i just love the monster in the water that turns out to be a machine. lame! this movie is just plain and simply terrible.

i watched this movie, or part of it, in hope that it would be fun to laugh at how bad it was, but it soon became clear that this was just plain silly. for one you have the worst acting ever! the lead "actress" birgitte nielsen is terrible, uninspired and hardly even attractive. and she certainly do not look like the female warrior who could easily kick some veteran warrior kings butt, but she does. and whats with the feminist attitude, it's plain hypocrisy. for one her family was killed by a women, then she joins some warrior school or something so she can learn how to fight men. she then joins up with a fat servant and his child king, whose city was destroyed by gedren. those two characters are just plain stupid and destroys the little of atmosphere that the movie managed to create. after this i could not take any more of nielsen painful acting, and the stupid clichés and lack of some real action.schwarzenegger as kalidor was the only part of this movie which actually made it remotely watchable. i liked the conan movie, but this is pure crap!

my mate and i chose to watch this obvious piece of junk purely based on its tagline after nearly 30 years of lousy and rudimentary teen slashers, i can't believe that only just now some nerdy horror brainiac come up with the brilliantly witty slogan "they axed for it"! other than that, "miner's massacre" is just as random, annoying and forgettable as all the rest out there. perhaps even more! the script contains all the typical clichés and features all the dreadfully stereotypic characters you wish a horrible and painful death to. the gore effects are computer engineered and thus beyond pitiable and the obligatory "big" stars (karen black, john philip law and richard lynch) are entirely wasted in spite of their top billing. cursed mines and abandoned ghost towns form an ideal horror setting  the creators of "my bloody valentine" already figured that out in the early 80's  but his dull film simply hasn't got any innovative ideas or even remotely surprising elements to offer. bunch of greedy twenty-something losers, which refer to themselves as friends even though they clearly can't stand each other, desecrate an ancient mine in search of the gold that is allegedly hidden there. of course they unwarily resurrect the zombie miner this way and he just 150 years of rest in order to prepare for a massive teen massacre. yay! the cast is exceptionally irritating in this one. the girls all have impressive racks but refuse to show anything. instead, they all prefer endless whining and the taking of needless risks. the dim-witted blokes clearly just serve as screen fillers. in her barely five minutes of playtime, karen black still manages to make an utter fool out of herself by depicting the most prototypic and hysterical local nut woman ever. the zombie has a stupid and very unconvincing face, but he looks okay and reasonably menacing when shown in the distant shadow of the moonlight whilst swinging around his pick-axe. since the best thing about "miner's massacre" concerns the aforementioned tagline and you can read that on the box in the video store itself, there's very little else to recommend here. director john carl buechler scored a few modest hits during the eighties, like notably the original "troll" and a fair "friday the 13th" sequel, but it's obviously time to retire now.

this movie really sucks, sucks really really hard, this movie should be in the bottom 100, but it is so bad that almost nobody has seen it to vote for her so many times that it should be at the same time of "manos - the hands of fate." i should have him position 1 (awful), but the reason for which i put him 2 was for eve, the girl of the town that, besides some scenes of nudity, besides, i thought of voting for 3, but like they killed eve, i returned at 2. it is that movies like this they should not be financed by anybody, since not even they took to the fame or other productions to the actors main, great falsehood, jaja, the history of a mining ghost that kills to "mansalva" and after they put an end to their misdeeds, it reappears, because with the end they shitted it very ugly. final score (vote): 2 (for the nudity and the performance of the beautiful eve)

the monster will look very familiar to you. so will the rest of the film, if you've seen a half-dozen of these teenagers-trapped-in-the-woods movies. okay, so they're not teenagers, this time, but they may as well be. three couples decide it might be a good idea to check out a nearly-abandoned ghost town, in hopes of finding the gold that people were killed over a scant century-and-a-half before. you'd think that with a title like "miner's massacre" some interesting things might happen. they don't. in fact, only about 1/10 of the film actually takes place in the mine. i had envisioned teams of terrified miners scampering for their lives in the cavernous confines of their workplace, praying that black lung disease would get them before the grim reaper exacted his grisly revenge, but instead i got terrestrial twenty-somethings fornicating--and, in one case, defecating--in the woods, a gang of morons with a collective i.q. that would have difficulty pulling a plastic ring out of a box of cracker jacks, much less a buried treasure from an abandoned mine. no suspense, no scares, and plenty of embarrassing performances give this turkey a 3 for nudity.

this movie absolutely terrible ..not only was the acting awful but so was the sleep got while this movie played..this movie achieved the all powerful goal of crap ..i watched this movie thinking my 5$ wouldn't b in vein .but i was very wrong ..i guarantee u r better off just reading what i have to say about this unbelievably horrible movie b4 ..puttin yourself in the way of this dignity depriving movie ..i give it a negative 1 for trying..but no please no don't watch this movie..i had friends who joined me for this film..shortly after they were no longer found this movie actually will make u end your life please please don't see it i beg of u. if u see this movie make sure u destroy all copies because this movie is a spawn of satan.

"curse of the forty-niner" doesn't really deserve a long and detailed review, so i'll just make some random observations about it:- cool opening credits.- no plot.- is there anyone who's ever seen a horror film before and can't guess, within the first 20 minutes, who will survive and who will not among this group of walking stereotypes?- hey, that newcomer (alexandra ford) is pretty hot!- richard lynch (made-up to look about 100 years old) and john phillip law have fun, tongue-in-cheek cameos.- karen black has a bigger role, but she's not fun - she's rather embarrassing.- martin kove is on-screen for about 40 seconds, but still got his name on the video cover. did they pay him for this appearance or was it the other way around? - i hate cheap computer-generated effects in horror films.*1/2 out of 4.

a group of friends discover gold deep inside an old mine. but by taking the gold and thinking they've hit it big, they awaken a long dead miner who's hell bent on protecting his treasure. "miner's massacre" is a chintzy b-horror movie in the extreme. you've got all your familiar clichés, your group of intellectually-impaired teenagers, characters going off on their own to investigate strange noises, a few pop-scares, the mysterious sheriff, the old lady who everyone thinks is nuts (played by top-billed karen black no less), and so on. nevertheless, it's done in an amusing, non-pretentious fashion that makes the film mindlessly entertaining in a "so bad, it's good" kind of way. the characters and dialog are what you'd expect from this type of filmfamiliar, routine and unoriginal. the actors all do a decent job though, consideringi've actually seen bigger-budget films of it's type with worse acting (i know what you did last summer, anyone?) and add a bit of credibility to the film itself. the villain in this film (the 49'er) is obviously derived from the creeper from jeepers creepers, all the way down to the brown overcoat, the hat and the long white hair. like the creeper he never talks, and is butt-ugly to boot. the gore is somewhat disappointing in my opinion. there are a couple of fairly gruesome moments, but too much is off-screen and the death scenes are often laughable (spoiler ahead!). there's one truly hilarious moment where a girl gets decapitated by the said villain, and to achieve this 'effect', the filmmakers hid the actress's body beneath the villain's coat, with her head poking out, and put some fake blood on her neck. seriously, you could see the outline of her shoulders! i think they could have done a little better there, even if the budget was low (and i'm sure it was, but, still). the special effects are cheap but sufficiently effective and for the most part, moderately well done for a low-budget film. either the effects guys or the director seem to have a thing for explosions and fire. almost every scene towards the end of the film has at least a couple of characters being burn to death (always filmed in slow motion) or something exploding, be it a car or an old mine cave. seriously, hasn't anyone ever heard the term; "stop, drop and roll"!?!?!?"miner's massacre" (or "curse of the forty-niner", what ever you want to call it) is cheesy and dumb, albeit entertaining, and as long as you don't have expectations through the roof, you'll be sufficiently entertained. i'm feeling generous, so i'll give it a 4/10.

this is an embarrassing nth rehashing of the same plot in the nth bunch-of-idiots-young-adult-in-peril-because-they-are-idiots slasher movie of the early millennium: this time we get the story of a crazy miner who comes back from the dead to retake his gold from the hands of the usurpers. we have almost no thrills, almost no bare flesh (even if the girls are really hot only one of them goes showing her bare ass for a few seconds), the usual bunch of sunset boulevard horror stars in cameo roles (this time karen black, richard lynch, john philip law, jeff conaway), lots of fake blood, only the crazy miner resurrected as a zombie is cool enough to leave you stuck - well not exactly - to the screen till the end. don't waste your time if you are not a completist.

i am shocked to see that this movie has been given more than two stars by some people. they must either be kidding or be totally blind for the art of acting, directing and other flaws of the movie.i must admit that i just could not force myself to sit through the whole movie, it was just too bad.the three first characters, not including the "digger" were just awful actors, and i mean awful! maybe the director didn't care, or may be he is a worse director. it was like watching a bad school play. the movie was of course filmed with a video camera (lowbudget - not real film), and the light settings were not very good either. in addition, the sound man (if they had one) must either have been a newbie or a drunk as the sound were amateurish. even in one of the first scenes from the kitchen (awful acting btw) the sound from the dialog was pretty bad. for example, when the woman moved her head while speaking, you could hear her voice disappear and come back. it sounded like they had tried to correct that in post-production by turning up the volume a bit when she turns her head. in addition, you had the ongoing irritating buzzing sound from either camera equipment or other sources in the kitchen. all these squeakers in the first 5 minutes or so. need i say more?a good school project or fun project for friends to watch, but should never have been released for a real audience, especially not for a paying audience. this was a rip off unless you have a very low standard regarding movies, or just bad taste. you are warned! sb.

let me start out by saying i love horror movies. big budget, low budget, big name actors, no name actors, it doesn't matter. and when it comes to judging movies i am very forgiving. this movie however, is pretty bad.the actors show little or no emotion when delivering their lines and the acting is worse than many lower budget horror flicks i've seen. as the actors get killed off, you could care less. there is very little gore (i have no idea what film other reviewers watched when they say there is good gore in this one, because there isn't) and the special effects are substandard at best. they steal so much from so many better horror movies (jeepers creepers, friday the 13th, leprachaun) and it still doesn't help.luckily i saw this on showtime and didn't have to actually pay any extra money to see it or waste a spot in my netflix queue on it. there are so many better horror movies out there and i recommend you see those instead of this big letdown.

the storyline is a ticked off claim jumper made a deal with the devil to find gold, and is forced to protect it forever. a bunch of friends find the gold and gets talked by the old miner and they're forced to blow the gold to smithereens in order to send him back to hell.i mean seriously...how did this film not win the oscar for movie of the year? what a compelling storyline of late 20 year olds running from a claim jumper straight out of the 1800's. i love how in other movies you can't kill the monster but they can knock it out...this movie they write the monster as completely indestructible.the opening of the movie clearly rips off nightmare on elm street part 4 but what the hell, not like that movie was a 5 star classic either.highlight of the movie is when we're introduced to a girl who's never been to school, never been out of the town, never learned to read or write....yet speaks perfect english, is smoking hot and wears the latest fashion. how did the oscar's miss that? ok i'm done with the bad jokes, this movie is pure crap and only watch it if u have nothing better to do and all the spices on the spice rack are in alphabetical order already.2 out of 10

how does anyone keep on seeing horror movies after this one??? really this one it's so bad that makes me sick!! and love horror movies but come on....... who could had remembered to do such a awful movie? it as no history!!it's only a men who chases a bunch of teenagers because they take something from him !!! and what have they took?? gold....it's typical.... the movie is boring from the beginning until the end!! and what is karen black who is a great actress doing in such a ridiculous movie like this? but what can i say ?? i think everyone should see it because my opinion is my opinion!! may be you would like??? i don't think so but.....

oh dear oh dear. it really gets on my nerves when a low budget, pointless horror affair tries to look interesting in the credits by having a bunch of good names pop up in the cast, only to involve each one in the smallest, most pointless possible roles. in this film, we have richard lynch in one scene, a momentary appearance from martin kove, a brief spot for vernon welles, slightly more time on screen for john philip law and a little time for karen black. this bunch of random cameos does not really add up to much though richard lynch and karen black do raise some of the few smiles of this film with their appearances, and its quite painful really, as none of the main cast are much good at all. i couldn't help but think that if more scenes were filmed with any of the b movie veterans above the film would be a whole lot better but as it is there are just a few tantalising glimpses of good entertainment without the film ever actually attaining much entertainment value. of the main cast the only charismatic or likable performances in my opinion were steve wastell, as axel and his girlfriend who i believe was played by elina madison (never heard of her before but she has some measure of screen presence and is a good looker). the plotting in this one is simple, evil undead miner goes after those who eek to steal his gold, and it should make for good slasher fun, especially given that it is directed by john carl buechler, who has done special effects for many of these sort of films, including having worked on all three of the major slasher franchises (halloween, elm street and friday 13th) and such small gems as mausoleum. unfortunately, the film is sadly lacking in suspense, likability and satisfying gore. there are one or two mildly gory moments but nothing worth the effort of watching the film, i wouldn't say. in fact, aside from the above mentioned cameos this entire movie is really quite stale and turgid with characters that couldn't get offed quick enough for my liking and an unfortunate lack of any real interest. i didn't even find it fun in a laughable bad movie sense, which is rare for me, since i love a lot of pretty crummy films. i'd say, avoid.

and unfortunately, so did i. any movie that relies on a bad pun as its tagline or its title should be relegated to the $2.00 bin, but we decided to try a second consecutive bad movie for movie night. we had a winner in "house of the dead"--go with that one if you want a laughable flick.some witch jumped into the water after being set on fire by mr. miner. some guy took a dump in the woods. and that same guy grabbed a new girlfriend right in front of his old one. i don't remember much else. the last third of the movie was utterly insipid, and we were all waiting in agony until the end.

the monster will look very familiar to you. so will the rest of the film, if you've seen a half-dozen of these teenagers-trapped-in-the-woods movies. okay, so they're not teenagers, this time, but they may as well be. three couples decide it might be a good idea to check out a nearly-abandoned ghost town, in hopes of finding the gold that people were killed over a scant century-and-a-half before. you'd think that with a title like "miner's massacre" some interesting things might happen. they don't. in fact, only about 1/10 of the film actually takes place in the mine. i had envisioned teams of terrified miners scampering for their lives in the cavernous confines of their workplace, praying that black lung disease would get them before the grim reaper exacted his grisly revenge, but instead i got terrestrial twenty-somethings fornicating--and, in one case, defecating--in the woods, a gang of morons with a collective i.q. that would have difficulty pulling a plastic ring out of a box of cracker jacks, much less a buried treasure from an abandoned mine. no suspense, no scares, and plenty of embarrassing performances give this turkey a 3 for nudity.

seeing the cover of this before i watched it, my expectations weren't high, especially since it was amongst those other crappy horror movies at blockbuster (alongside films like junior).alright, not only does this movie have the brainless stereotypical characters (the rich douche bag, the bitch, the sheriff, the localer that knows what's going wrong in the town, and so forth), but has such god-awful dialogue, acting, directing, and cg effects. the jeremiah stone dude was hilarious. (*spoiler*) i'll never understand why he bit his finger off out of nowhere when he was holding that chick up hostage.the premise for the movie is just as atrocious as the other flaws. from what i could get from it, jeremiah stone was a gold digger during the gold rush, and a notorious outlaw. he had a crapload of gold, (*spoiler*) and put a curse on anyone who went after his gold before he was gunned down by the locals after he killed some girl, but not only did he survive, he bit off his own finger and ran off. so, present day, a group of clueless morons find out about this gold mine, and of course, they are warned by locals about "the curse of the forty-niner". and what do they do? as expected, ignored the warnings and greedily sought for the gold. they get the gold, and all sorts of s**t goes on. thankfully, (*spoiler*) the bitch gets her head cut off.that's about it. looking at the cover of the film, you can tell what kind of movie it's going to be. it's just so terrible it's hilarious.1 1/2 stars out of 5.

a group of douche-bag teenagers go up to an old mining town in hopes of finding gold nuggets. the one hitch in the hair-brained scheme is that the ancient supernatural miner whom the gold belongs to doesn't wish to part with his treasure so easily and so begins to dispatch the interlopers accordingly. literally cliché-sprouting dialog, horrible acting, some insanely terrible 'southern dialect' and a lame unmemorable killer who resembles jeepers creepers (without the aforementioned's predilection of young boys naturally) combine to make this stinker just about unwatchable. even cult legend actress karen black in a small role can't save this aberration.eye candy: elina madison shows (badly lit) t&a my grade: d- where i saw it: tmcx

(there are spoilers) usual slasher film with the story taking place in and around this god-forsaken mine outside the almost deserted town of sutterille. after receiving a letter map and gold nugget from her brother jared, shadrach smith, clair and her husband nick breman, carrie bradac & sean hines, drive to the village together with four other friends and armature gold-prospectors alx & tori, steve wastell & sangie, and hayden & rox ann, rick majeske & elina to stake their claim. it later turns out that the fact that jared disturbed the long-forgotten gold mine caused the ghost of the notorious jeremiah stone, vernon wells, to come back to life and with that restart his reign of terror. stone, or 49er, is about the most ridicules slasher/killer in motion picture history. stone looks like he was buried for years under a few tons of coal runs around with this hook slicing people in two. after doing in almost the entire cast local hermit aunt nelly, (karen black), who's daughter eve (alexandra ford) was also one of stone's victims, tells those still alive that unless they return the gold back to the stone mine the crazed miner will never rest until he kills all those who still have it.aunt nelly is given just enough time to tell her story before she's turned into a human torch by stone and ends up jumping into a nearby stream.the movie goes on endlessly with the killer miner on the rampage looking like he's about as scary as burnt toast and just as dark. even those in the film seemed to show no real fear of him. in one scene when he broke into aunt nelly's house everyone inside all charged, instead of running away, him causing the ghost miner to lose his right arm; stone spent the rest of the movie with a miner's pick attached to his "stump". besides actress karen black the film "miners massacre" also has veteran actors john phillip law and richard lynch as the town sheriff murphy and old man prichard. passable stuff but nothing special the movie has a predictable ending with the entire gold mine going up in flames. the audience given a hint by the makers of "miners massacre" that the end to this mindless lunacy is nowhere in sight and may very well resurface in the very near future in a possible sequel, god help us all!

top gun without the in-house animosity. or class. or money. or cruise. an excuse for an upwardly mobile cast of next-big-thing actors to market their ability to lead a matinée this doesn't really have anything anyone can get their teeth into. it's a shame because the opening shot of charlie sheen opens out with great promise which is squandered almost straight away with a preposterous wedding set piece. barking.dennis haysbert is a changeable actor for me but in this film he is fine, particularly the action sequences. michael biehn is a first-class action hero but not a leading man: charlie sheen is, to all intents and purposes, the leading man but never quite an action hero. there's a stunt cast of hundreds who are also mentionworthy. 3/10

the contemporary chapter of the u.s. navy's elite underwater demolition team is called to do.... whatever they want, apparently.charlie sheen was made an officer. already the storyline is unbelievable. michael biehn is his immediate c.o., but he keeps charlie on a rather long leash and one of the guys pays for it early on by getting killed thanks to charlie's patented stupidity. the rest of the team spends their spare time committing courts-martial offenses. mostly an exercise in random gunfire and paper-thin ethics, these particular seals might be better suited to serving as crash-test dummies.some good action scenes counter the goofy proceedings.

someone commented that charlie sheen's character should be court martialed for doing whatever he wanted. you may be right, but that is how seal's truly are. i served for several months with a seal team out of norfolk, va. actually, i should say they used our ship to deploy themselves around europe for a couple of months. i was the postal clerk on board and everyday these guys would try to get their mail. since only one person was allowed to pick up the mail each day we issued one pass to one person. each day a different seal would come up pretending to be someone else. well, after the third time i said no to them until i had proof who they were. they went nuts!!! i thought they were gonna bust through my cage, gag me, and then steal the mail. luckily i had not only the president on my side (the navy), but the federal government (us mail). that was the only time i saw the seals stopped from having whatever they wanted. they were allowed unlimited shore leave, where we had to be back on ship at a certain time. they killed and tortured a woman in france and the two seal's only got a 1 week detention on ship, whereas a seamen was caught stealing a bottle of wine from a french wine shop and he got a court martial. is it any wonder why the seal's retention rate is over 85%? as a seal you are god. so this movie does a pretty accurate job of portraying how a seal acts and thinks... unfortunately it is so unbelievable to normal people that it comes off as being fake.

oh, man, i hated this movie. granted, the site locations were great, but that's about the only positive thing i can say about it. now, i'm going to state right at the beginning that i am very critical of the way weapons, especially firearms, are both portrayed, and handled, in movies. being a war flick, portrayal was fine, but the shoddy weapons handling in the movie would have never been tolerated by a real seal team. the acting was more wooden than my first sailboat, the equipment carried (or lack of it) was laughable, and the dialogue was, shall we say, lacking in anything interesting. well, with the exception of the journalist, which was actually prescient. watching this movie was comparable to watching "palmetto" with woody harrelson, where each scene was so bad you just couldn't turn it off, because you had to see if they could get worse with the next scene. like palmetto, they certainly did. the scene in the water, where, after shooting the first of the enemy, they blow the damn boat up, thereby having to face possible drowning, made me laugh so hard, that for a millisecond, i almost thought it was worth waiting through the movie for. then charlie sheen decided to drag the surviving enemy down to the depths of the ocean (the way it was filmed, with the many camera cuts, it looked like they went down about 80 feet. nice continuity there....) before slashing his throat was so damn stupid, i was stunned. then again, so was the whole damn movie. i enjoy action movies, but not this one. note: the version i watched was a tv version, pan & scan. i can't imagine that made a difference, except for making the whole thing blessedly shorter!

i learned little of significance from this film that i did not already know from cnn and the new york times. (and i did not follow the enron case obsessively as did some others.) the film did a very poor job of explaining what "business" enron was in that might actually have been on the up-and-up before it started hiding its debts in the entities created by andy fastow. it also significantly underplayed the role played by arthur andersen and vinson & elkins in validating practices that were afterwards found to be illegal. nor did it go as far as it might have in exploring what the "investors" -- all those prominent bankers -- thought they were doing. with the 24 hour a day cable networks, the discovery channel and the history channel, documentaries have proliferated. i've seen many in the past year that were better than this one.

as a ca resident, i'd like to see the jackholes who were shutting down the electricity plants to raise the prices get some jail time too. i thought the movie was pretty good and has some very informative pieces. while they stuck to how enron rose and crashed, i found it really interesting. however, when the movie focused on it's anti-bush slant, it made me wonder if they were really being accurate. it's fine to point out any connection the republicans had to enron, but the monster was created while clinton was president. the ca energy crisis happened under davis's watch. both were in office during enron's abuses, but neither are held accountable in any way. rather, many minutes are spent on how bush was friends with lay. so what? lay played golf with clinton and spent the night in the lincoln bedroom. why are democrats given such a free pass in this film? i think most politicians are a waste of our taxpayer money so i'm not partial to either party but i hate feeling like i'm subject to someone's political agenda when i watch a documentary. yes, politicians deserve some blame, but i really doubt that the only guilty one's have rs after their names. i found no value in portraying the bush's as kay-lovers when democrats received just as much enron campaign money as republicans did. like i said, it weakens the rest of the film for me because it makes me suspicious of the rest of the facts they lay out.

i really liked the idea of traveling between dimensions, and i even liked the wade/quinn tension in early episodes. some of the worlds they created gave the main characters extremely interesting backdrops for their stories. however, as the show went on there were more silly disputes among the friends and less of a true bond. there was less wonder and excitement when they were involved in other worlds and more condescension. and every world had one of the characters falling in love. the writing just got boring and everything was way too over the top. too bad it would've been nice to have a closely knit band of friends (a la star wars) traveling to different dimensions on tv for several years, rather than a tired band of knit pickers.

team spirit is maybe made by the best intentions, but it misses the warmth of "all stars" (1997) by jean van de velde. most scenes are identic, just not that funny and not that well done. the actors repeat the same lines as in "all stars" but without much feeling.

an example of all of the worst gay stereotypes all in one movie.and charles, why do you speak in that weird pseudo british/high-brow accent, and insist that the kid speak that way too? did anyone else notice that all of the soundtrack music is exactly the same? you should stick with the good old hollywood camp drag stuff that you are so good at! die mommy die ii, the sequel!! i don't see the value of spending time and money on a project like this; there are so many real life gay youth stories to be told and we should be seeing those, not this garbage. sheesh, what a waste of time. embarrassing example of gay cinema.

i have to say, its not very good. polly bergen is fine in this film.the rest are so so. i'm gay and honestly , there are so many cliché's for this time in history that its just sad. we started watching it then turned it off, then decided it would be fun to make fun of the rest of the film. but all said, the basic idea of the film is good. if it was re-written with less contrived lines and better acting it could have actually been prety good. over all i would not recommend it. in additon the this is coo coo thinking line is so lame. on top of that the fight in the hair salon is funny because its so bad. the lesbian sister in the room with them while they are trying to get it on is so weird its sad.

yes, lifetime has a habit of making the male species look stupid. and this soap opera ain't kidding when they make perry king, supposedly a well renowned medical doctor, unable to see the evil surrounding him. puts your trust in doctors, huh? how can anyone not see what's going on? is he that stupid? and the evil wife, with a face like a horse, goes around killing off his entire family without a trace. how does she acquire all the drugs? that isn't explained. how does she get off being a secretary in a hospital without any credentials? i guess the director, don fauntleroy asks us to just believe it. i didn't. i kept yelling at the screen at the stupidity of king with all right in front of his face. if the wife was that attractive, maybe, just maybe, i'd accept it. but she's not even that. shannon sturges is the perfect wife and i tell you she has the face of a horse. i wouldn't cross the street for her, yet our perfect husband does and quickly. after everybody in the cast get knocked off, i wasn't satisfied with the come up pence given to our villainess. she deserved more than she got. william moses plays the doctor's brother who unfortunately you know his outcome from day one. pleasure to at least see one pretty face in this clinker. that of lesley anne down. she gives the film a 2 count just on the relief of seeing someone fetching in this mess. perry king deserved his fate. what a jerk.

sometimes i think that somewhere in the "lifetime" channel's office complex there is a room where the writer's hang-out, with a large wheel on the wall - sort of like the big six ones in casinos. the latter have a lot of spots where you win even money, and fewer for higher amounts, until there are perhaps a couple which pay bigger bucks.but i picture the channel's wheel having about six different genres on its wheel, with two of them, appearing the most, labeled "the psychotic neighbor," or "the spouse with a hidden past or secret or both." "lifetime" movies have a few repetitive story lines, and these two seem to be the most ubiquitous.the "spouse..." category can have a spouse of long-standing, but some person appears, or an event occurs, exposing that the good wife was once a hooker, one of the couple was involved in some nefarious act long ago, or that something else in one of the background in different than presumed -- etc., etc., or, as in this flick, one of them has entered the marriage with the most nefarious of aims.one constant, in all of their genres is that the husband or other males are usually clueless, vacuous, and slow to have any idea what in the hell is going until the climax, or at best, very late in the proceedings (unless the male is the miscreant). not the case here.whether the referenced miscreant might be the "neighbor," or as in this offering, "the wife," it is always fascinating how easily, successfully and effortlessly they proceed with their dastardly deeds. they manipulate many of the others, whack them as necessary, assume various poses, and juggle more deceptions than you can count - with unfailing success until just before the end.the lead actor here, like many in this channel's movies, is an old hand. i noticed that another film in which he starred was titled "the perfect neighbor."finally, the vengeful "perfect wife" in this flick dispatches those in her path with more expertise and ease than the most experienced and competent "button man" in don corleone's family could muster. and i couldn't help but imagine that jack nocholson's melvin udall character fro "as good as it gets," with his massive ocd affliction, could provide counsel to the anti-heroine to assist in dealing with he obsession which was the basis of this opus.

purportedly this is the final film of the left behind series which is fundamentalist preacher and novelist tim lahaye's idea of what we can expect in our future in the final days of planet earth. if this is the case we can expect an activist presidency in every sense of the word if barack obama becomes president next year.the fantastic four of revelation are all back with one cast change, arnold pinnock who most would know as the guidance counselor in life with derek, is now the minister taking the place of clarence gilyard. brad johnson as the anti-christ's pilot by day and christian by night is there as his daughter janaya stephens and ace investigative reporter kirk cameron. these are the only four people on earth who have divined the true nature of un secretary general nicolai karpathy and once again are throwing sand in his machinery.this time they've got as an ally the president of the united states who is played by louis gossett, jr. he's having one hell of a rough time, especially the guerrillas launch on rpg attack on a presidential motorcade killing vice president charles martin smith. that's right, the toad is vice president. somebody really messed up bad here because everyone including those who would do them harm know a president and vice president never travel together. it takes all of them the entire film to convince gossett exactly who karpathy really is. once again the best one in the film is gordon currie as karpathy.we may yet see another left behind film yet, the door was left open though people assure me that they've run out of source material from tim lehaye. i suppose as long as they make money and these players can't get jobs in the mainstream film industry. and there are some unresolved plot issues involving brad johnson and chelsea noble who is mrs. kirk cameron in real life. one of the fantastic four does die in this film, so will it be the fantastic three or will they get another fourth. stay tuned.

this movie was ok, as far as movies go. it could have been made as a crossover into secular movies. however, it had little to do with the left behind books that it was supposedly based on. major story premises were removed, and new major story premises were added. what disappointed me most was how nicolae was portrayed. he was shown with supernatural powers that he did not have at this point in the books. antichrist is not satan, is not omniscient and not omnipotent. faith and beliefs were portrayed in weird, surreal ways that seemed to make the movie just silly.non-believers who watch this will have more ammunition to mock christian beliefs.

kudos to baxley's dp for making this look like a real movie, the first time that's happened in this series (with the notable exception of the f/x scenes). in moving closer to movie production values, however, it lost most of the entertainment value of the first two. they were very much in the 'so bad they're good' category of horrendous film entertainment. can an argument be made though that the 'believers' were simply trying to make a generic action film with praying in it? there are so many times in the film where they discard their own belief system as to be annoying. if everything that happens is according to god's will and they are simply his instruments, than the people who are infected with the virus have that happen as a part of his plan, right? apply that to every situation where someone of faith doesn't submit to god's will, and you get a fairly hypocritical little movie from the director of 'action jackson'.

in the 3rd installment of "left behind" the makers did not care to put any kind of continuity into the plot. although all weapons on the planet have been confiscated by the united nations, world war iii suddenly begins at the snap of a finger. within a few split-seconds the ex-lover of one of the main protagonists moves from passionately seducing him to outright hatred to a melancholy confession of love without any trace of direction. but foremost this film is really an irony-free zone. after the president of the united states accepts jesus as his savior he immediately becomes a suicide bomber and blows up a skyscraper in the middle of the city. osama bin laden will be very jealous when he sees this film!

lou gossett, jr. is an excellent and captivating actor, but to have him take the role of a "president" and then have him act like he's james bond, running around carrying a gun and entering a warehouse to uncover a plot to kill christians, and then being able to escape the supposedly high security facility to live another day, does not do him justice - this movie has so many unresolved issuesi will attempt to list just a few: 1 - what was the purpose of "stockpiling" a vaccine if no one is vaccinated? - for example, the preacher could have been vaccinated if the "tribulation force" already had vaccine on hand - later, buck williams' wife goes to be with the sick preacher and she herself becomes sick; so, was the virus, therefore, contagious? - if it was contagious, then why did ray and his wife go into the church without proper protection? - why didn't they become sick too? - and when chloe drank the wine and was "cured", how did she suddenly know the wine was the "antidote"? - was it california wine, ordinary red table wine? - could red grape juice been adequate - and,if the preacher had received "communion" at least every time he preached, maybe he would have had anti-dote flowing through his body already? - buck and chloe got a "heavy" box of vaccine that was never used - what mysterious message should we see in that? 2 - the presentation of "evil" forces who are working with the anti-christ nicolai to destroy the world, as being russian, chinese, etc., is really a relic of the 1950's and the early james bond era, and shows an ignorance of modern society and of humanity - are we to believe that russians and chinese are perpetually trying to destroy this planet? - and for what purpose, mere destruction? - this was such a narrow-minded view of this world and was so cliché as to be laughable3 - the main purpose of this movie was the scene near the very end where kirk cameron and lou gossett, jr. are proselytizing the non-believers in the audience (by showing kirk proselytizing lou) - it was a movie with no meaningful storyline, too many disconnects with reality, and a completely inappropriate plot for a great actori, therefore, rank this as a 1, since zero is not available

this film has got so much in it. prehistoric society, adventure, romance, true brotherhood, violence, sex, religion; all depicted abundantly..without a single word uttered!!! and how come it sucks so bad? this film will make you rethink the origin of humanity. if this were the product of anthropology, you would rather defy darwinian theory and hegelian synthesis all together. you cannot bear to watch this even with your brain shut down. and now you are thinking, "i've got to see this." i warned you. i take no responsibility whatsoever should you regret spending over an hour staring at this piece of art. well, i did warn you. this should be forgotten and buried for ever.

there is a reason why the world forgot these creatures: they are dull. this is a hammer production which means that whoever made this movie should be struck with a hammer, several times if possible - and where it most hurts. most people put more thought into taking a dump than these idiots have put into making this movie.seriously now the movie begins with some cavemen hunting an antelope-thing. now, antelopes must have evolved a lot from those pre-historic times because they actually attack and kill people here. after that, it's time to meet the rest of the tribe: more bearded men, some fashion-models, and even a couple of very old, grey-haired grannies and grandpas. these old geezers obviously never heard about cave people not surpassing the age of 30; they refused to bow to the will of both logic and pre-historical records, so they remain alive. one of the cavemen isn't bearded; he is clean-shaven. not quite as clean-shaven as tarzan, the lord of the humanoid clean-shaven ones roaming the jungle since childhood and without a razor, but thereabouts.what follows is the obligatory earthquake/molten-lava destruction sequence which causes a lot of our not-so-hairy friends to meet their doom. it is interesting to note that before the earthquake the fashion-models showed their breasts more. after it, they must have gotten shy or something, because they covered their chests for a while (maybe they were covered by ash so i mistakenly thought they were covered). more action follows in the form of two fashion-models wrestling in the sand; the next-best thing to female mud-wrestling, i suppose. after a good deal of the desert has been crossed, our black-haired tribe meets - how else could it be - a blond tribe. yawn.more spellbinding stuff follows. there is that redhead fashion-model who is bothered by seeing a cave-teen kill a hedge-hog-thing. there is also the scene of a woman dying at birth: those cave-fashion-models are so frail. eventually we get to meet an even darker -haired and -skinned tribe, i.e. an evil tribe. one of them becomes a wwf champion after he actually beats(!) a huge bear-thing in a wrestling bout. 1,2,3... and it's done: the bear is the loser. we also witness a jealous caveman miraculously recover from two major injuries: first he gets stabbed with a big spear into the thigh, yet he walks away from that as if it were but a scratch. then he gets thrown off a cliff - onto a big rock - by the blond goodie-two-shoes caveman, yet he walks away from it as if he were thrown onto a giant sofa. it's unclear in the end whether he dies from falling off an even higher cliff or from that voodoo doll being crushed. oh yes, voodoo was used in pre-historic times by white tribes that live in the desert and whose females were fashion-models. it's always important to learn from movies.the message of the movie is as insightful as it is educational: cave people liked to fight for local power and they loved their fashion-models, too. as if any self-respecting caveman would fight to be leader of such a sorry bunch.

where do i start? the box should have been enough to keep me away from this attempt, but i'd been taught early on not to judge a book (or movie) by its cover, so i ignored the disgusting graphic quality of the box and rented it anyway. but common sense should tell you that if they can't do a single still image properly, then how dismal will the moving ones be, later? yeah. they were pretty awful.the actors in this flick appeared totally unaware they were being filmed, as just any expression seemed to do fine, regardless of the situation the characters were in or what they were reacting to.however, a good story can offset the downfalls of low budget productions. good dialog can carry a poorly-funded attempt at times. unfortunately, this was not one of those times, as the story was as weak and nonexistent as the other required elements of good cinema.there simply aren't words for how bad this was. perhaps you can get the idea from my rating of -2.3/10 from...the fiend :.

spoilersthis movie was rented as a joke, and what a joke it was. the film is based on a dog catcher who is looking for el chupacabra. the dog catchers outfit is so ridiculous. it looks like he sewed the patch on his hat and for some reason he shows of his "muscles" by rolling up his sleeves. throughout the movie, mostly at night, you can see how bad the lighting was. they are in a car which is brightly lit and they are driving in pitch black. often you can see the camera man's shadow on the ground. the costumes are terrible, the lighting is terrible, and the acting is terrible. this is a good movie for a laugh...maybe.

this is a great example of what could have been a great film and a great idea but turned out to be really bad in the process. i was mainly tempted to get this because of the dvd cover, stupid me, but i did anyway and i was blown away, in a bad sense. this movie is essentially about el chupacabra wreaking havoc around los angeles and it's up to a local animal cop and a writer to save the day, before two corrupt cops and two evil scientists bring them down. the main reason why i did not enjoy this film was because of big continuity errors that were hard to not notice. along with some bad acting, okay lighting and nothing scary, this movie did not hit me as much as is it probably should have. however, compared to other chupacabra movies, this one certainly tops the charts, just barely.first off, the continuity in this movie is way off and i mean off the shoulders and into the ditch. there were so many points were the characters said or did something and then in the next shot, they aren't doing it or the change never occurred. case in point: the main character has a gun, the chupacabra attacks, he whips out a flair from nowhere and distracts and the gun in missing. the girl runs while he defends here with the mystery flair and she had no gun, then the main character is running with the girl and has the gun. where did the flair come from and what happened to the gun. the time of day gets screwed up. one minute it is sun set and you can still see the sun and then the next minute it looks like midnight. there were some plot holes as in, why was the chupacabra there, what were the scientists doing, what happened to this guy and why did he shoot the animal and it still lived? these things bugged the heck out of me and none of the questions were answered.next on the list is the acting. boy was it wooden and bad. the main character navarro, played by eric algeria, seems a bit too calm at points and too dedicated to finding out what killed a few dogs and when a tragedy hits, his emotion was just not there. elina madison, who played starlina, did a fairly poor job. she was the author of a bestselling book about the chupacabra and she just didn't seem into her role or her performance. her acting was kind of laughable and a poor. even for an author she knows too much about that thing, and knows how to disable a high security defense system in a hidden laboratory. tony criss was okay, but he seemed a bit to calm for some of the stuff that was going on. the movie reminds me of a bad reenactment to murder for some crime solving show, where the actors and actresses aren't really that committed to their work.i rarely don't get this anal when it comes to lighting or editing, but for this movie, i could not help but be harsh on the lighting. it took me out of the movie a number of times because the lighting was so poorly directed. there were times when they were trying to be creative by adding color filters to the scene to make it more "comic bookish," but it backfired. the worse part is at night when it is pith black outside, but the scene is so oversaturated with light, it seems like its day. they keep switching from high intensity light to soft light for random scenes, and the lights seem so bright that the actors were squinting. it shouldn't be that bright that there are dark shadows at night. during the sunset when the lighting was perfect, that's the only time when the light was good, other than that it was terrible.there were not scares in this film. there was only one time where i did jump but other than that, it wasn't scary. there were points were it probably could have been scary but it was so damn light out, you could see the chupacabra approach the man, but if it was dark, it would have been better. even the creature design for the chupacabra was poor, it looked good but it was a short man or kid in a jump suit. they didn't hide his face; they showed him with no sense of mystery or any enigmatic appearance. there was a fair amount of gore, but it seemed unreal. this movie just wasn't scary, that's all.overall, they did americanize a great south american legend into a blood-thirsty human eater, which the chupacabra isn't. in fact, it was scared of people and it only killed goats, sheep, dogs and deer because it was said that it hated the smell of humans. but, then were would the story be? i did not enjoy this film for any reason, but i will give them credit for trying to make a good film with good intentions. i would not recommend this film to any horror fan, but if you like indie or b-movies, you should check this out. also, if you are easily tempted by cult-classics, you'd enjoy this film. i didn't, i won't see it again, but in some deep sedated way, i enjoy these kinds of movie just to see what the other side of hollywood is making.

boyle heights, los angeles: legendary south american goat-sucking vampire, el chupacabra, is on the loose, feeding on anyone unlucky enough to cross its path. animal control officer navarro (eric alegria) and chupacabra expert/author starlina divide (elina madison) attempt to track down the creature, but find their progress hampered by a pair of dumb cops, money hungry locals keen to capture the beast for a fat reward, and a couple of nefarious scientists who want the monster for their experiments.stinking higher than a two-week-old taco, el chupacabra is an incredibly bad horror movie that even fans of incredibly bad horror movies might struggle to sit through. with its dreadful script, awful direction (by not one, but two talentless hacksbrennon jones and paul wynne), laughable dialogue, and some of the worst acting this side of a porn flick, i recommend this film about as much as i do drinking the tap water in mexico.as navarro and starlina proceed with their investigations, viewers are treated to some incredibly weak gore, the worst designed book jacket in history, the most unconvincing dead person i've seen since the blinking corpse in dr. butcher md, and a high-tech computerised security system consisting of a keyboard nailed to a post.to be fair, for a guy in a rubber suit, the monster itself is fairly creepy (hairy, with big claws, and a face like a particularly ugly bat), but its appearances are few and far between, with more screen time spent on the tedious trials and tribulations of whiney officer navarro than on the killer antics of the titular creature (just how many times is it necessary to see navarro handing in paperwork to his bitchy boss?).if, like me, you make the mistake of wasting your hard-earned cash on this dreadful latino bilge (in my case, it was a whole 50p), consider using the disc as a coaster for your tequila rather than actually watching it.

according to this masterpiece of film-making's script (pun intended), charles darwin was full of nonsense when he presented his evolution theory, because he made absolutely no mention of any alien intervention. for you see, aliens sent chupacabras to the earth and they form the missing link in the evolution theory. however, the rest of the film clearly seems to emphasize that chupacabras are a typically puerto rican phenomenon, so i don't really know where that fits in. are they saying all puerto ricans are aliens? whatever, it's all pretty irrelevant anyway. the only thing you need to memorize is that "el chupacabre" is an utterly cheap and imbecilic amateur b-movie, lacking tension, character development and any form of style. several duos of people are chasing this goat-munching monster (remotely resembling the midget version of the pumpkinhead demon) through the streets and ghettos of an ugly city. we have an untalented dogcatcher and a nagging female novelist, a pair of obnoxious cops and the supposedly evil scientist with his dim-witted accomplice. since they all are extremely incompetent in what they do, the monster can carelessly carry on devouring all the latino immigrants of the neighborhood. the monster itself looks okay and the make-up effects on his victims' leftovers are acceptably gross and bloody. the acting performances are irredeemably awful and headache inducing. particularly eric alegria is pitiable in his first and only lead role as the overly ambitious employee of animal control. yes, it's an incredibly stupid film, but surely you have struggled yourself through worse and less amusing low-budget garbage.

this movie is a complete and utter waste of time, one of the worst films i've ever seen. and coming from me, that is definitely saying something. in fact, i wish i could have given it negative stars instead of just rating it as a pathetic one-star awful.when i rented this movie, i had an open mind. i find the legend of the chupacabra interesting and i have a fondness for cheesy horror flicks. but i draw the line at this one.the acting sucked. the lead male gives one of the worst performances ever, looking and sounding unnatural as he delivers his poorly written lines. the lead female gives a slightly more palatable performance, but that really doesn't take much.the chupacabra... well, considering how low budget this movie must have been, the creature was tolerable. it does, however, look exactly like someone in a mask and body suit. the mask is fairly detailed and might look cool in person, but not so on screen.speaking of on screen, you'd think they could have at least used a better camera. it looks like it was shot with a camcorder for crying out loud. not a very good one, either.i don't know what whoever wrote this abomination was thinking. the dialog sucks and just... i can't describe what i feel about it. at least not without getting in trouble with the site.my advice? avoid this at all costs. it's just not worth it. if it comes on tv and you have nothing else to do or watch, then *find* something else to do or watch. read a book, listen to music, *anything.* just don't subject yourself to this. if you do, you cannot say you weren't warned. and for lord and lady's sake, don't rent this sucker. it is not worth it, even if you get the chance to rent it for fifty cents. trust me, i know.

i really liked this movie. number 5, the star robot of the movie gets hit by lightning and some thing happened to his circuits. he act and thinks more like a human.the robot repeats commercials he learns after watching tv. he then applies these sayings to his circumstances. number 5 is quick witted and funny. the character imitates voices of stars, tries to dance like john travolta in staying alive and a lot of other things. he has a saying for most of his circumstances that he memorized. the actions of the robots is really good. number 5 wants to drive, cook and please stefany with all the characteristics of a human. the way the robots move and line up is really hysterical.i am disappointed that the writers could not keep this clean for all viewers. this movie has a surpris ending something you would not expect. i hate movies that have swearing in them even though i like them i give them a lower rating. this movie had swearing words. jesus christ was used as swearing word which offends me it is used a least 3 times. g-d d-m, bull sh_t etc. it could have been a wonderful movie with out all this offensive language. there is no sex in this film, some violence like robots blowing up cars and machines.

i saw the movie in original italian. it must be said that the acting and interpretation is most heavily polluted by the tv-generated trend to speak in a severely muffled voice, not moving lips, straining tones, as emerged in the "that's real life"-productions and "let's-raise-our audience-with-a-few-tears"-screen-playwriting. the late massimo girotti towers upon the other characters for intensity, clarity of expression and intellectual honesty. the movie has some good hints, but (as in another comment before mine) it lacks a focal point and dribbles away in many plot-lets of lesser and lesser relevance, another trend dragged in from the tv productions, well known to italians. a few drops in style could be spared to the public, such as the patisserie drag (charm and aesthetics of cooking plus sensual payload of sweets, see chocolat, babette's lunch, vatel etc.) hammam and the fairies are definitely more truthful, seems that ozpetek has learned the tune of italy in the early 2000s and is humming along... i'll give him a last chance though...

if this film was just outrageously poor would be fine, the problem is many take it seriously. to make it short, a few points: - there is no story, no focus, no lead whatsoever and all the questions raised fail to find an answer. overall, the film is extremely repetitive and boring (i have been in war-torn african countries several times and found all the lingering on local misery and hopelessness very painful to watch but still having no sense).- questions raised are pure manipulation and the truth is that they are no questions but statements.- i am no doc filmmaker, but what's the point in raising, for example, the question of weapon smuggling, if the only element brought to the audience is a local reporter's statement? the director doesn't even bother showing us at least a sequence where he would be waiting near the airport trying to spot heavily loaded trucks leaving the area right after a plane landed.- the story of the fish takes up less than 5 mn, and is only supported by a sequence where the director films a documentary shown during a local conference. did this guy do any work at all???? - abject poverty is shown all the time in endless sequences but where's the point? one can go almost anywhere in africa with a hand cam and shoot the same images unfortunately. where's the big news? - filming the prostitutes watching and crying over images of their assassinated friend and fellow prostitute is worth the worst emotional manipulations one can see these days on thrash and real tv.- the parallel drawn between the famine devastating the country with over two million starving and the exportation of fish is absolutely pointless, dishonest and makes no sense but to manipulate viewers in typically anti-globalization and anti-western feelings.there is an interesting debate in france after an academic published a very detailed comment on the film, which brought number of journalists working in africa for decades to investigate a bit further about several details. it turns out that: - the fish waste shown drying in the sun and collected by some local people is not at all meant to be eaten by human beings but is collected to be exported for reasonably good money for animal-feeding purposes. i think i am not the only one having had the impression that the director suggested the exact opposite.- arm smuggling is a reality (but there again, where's the big news??), but not the way this film explains the issue. if the empty planes landing in mwanza do participate in smuggling, they actually unload their shipment in a different location in africa, then go to mwanza to pick up fish in order not to make the trip back empty (meaning that they do actually land empty in mwanza...).- people do eat fish locally, contrary to what the film suggest (around 40-60% of what is taken out of the lake) and thousands of people make their living with it. good for them! it's private business of that kind that will one day take african countries out of poverty and not western moaning and endless foreign assistance.i cannot tell how shocked i am seeing the success of this film!

i think the movie was one sided i watched it recently and find the documentary typical of western movie makers that was biased without substance. the fact is prostitution do exist everywhere in the world not in tanzania alone and not because of this fish business, there prostitutes were there way before the russian and other business people arrived in mwanza. poverty is indeed endemic in africa let alone tanzania and this is not because of fish fillet business, in fact the fish industry has helped millions to support their families on their daily life. this movie just tarnish the good image of this peace loving country. as for the arms trade the film could not substantiate if there is any truth in that indeed looking critically at the films one is doubting the authenticity of the film maker, it seems that their trying to prove their point by using a few characters which can be done for anything really. yes tanzania is a poor country yes there are prostitutes and street children but they are not the product this business, it is just a common scenario in most poor countries indeed the world over even in the western world...what a load of rubbish.the pilot themselves are talking of sending weapons to angola which is more than 2000km south of tanzania and the war was in drc also miles away from mwanza, the director could not give evidence how these weapons were transported from mwanza to drc!in short the films lacks focus and respectability, it is quite easy to find the character anywhere in africa and has nothing to do darwin's nightmare or fish fillet...what a load of rubbish!the truth is the nile perch has not decimated all other species in the lake contrary to what the movie portrays and also less than 25% of all catches from lake victoria are exported the rest is consumed locally so lets get that one right.

my mom and i went to see this film because my brother is serving in the u.s. peace corps in the same region in which it's set. halfway through the film, i decided that given its failure to measure up to what it pretends to accomplish, the title is pretentious. the subject it deals with could have made for an excellent documentary, but because of its poor execution, it left me far less educated about the issue than i had hoped to become. i agree with laura-jane from canada ("powerful message but lacks focus."). i also agree with the user who commented that this filmmaker's narration-free style is the opposite of that of michael moore, but i don't agree that it presents varying points of view and invites the viewer to decide for him- or herself. i do agree with one user's comment that "a lesson is better learned when we draw the conclusions ourselves"; however, our conclusions can't be anything but poorly founded if we are presented with little relevant information from which to draw them.the main points of the documentary seemed to be that 1) the african people who live near lake victoria are very poor and suffer greatly. 2) the introduction of perch to lake victoria, inflicted by europeans, ruined its ecosystem. 3) the communities surrounding lake victoria are financially dependent on the perch economy.the best things i can say about the film is that it attempted to relate the perspectives of the average people in sub-saharan africa, which, unfortunately, is an anomaly among films, and that it attempted to portray poverty as the result of a dysfunctional economic system rather than a universal, inevitable phenomenon. i liked the irony it captured in the massive amount of fish leaving the country in the face of a famine. i appreciated the portrayal of how out of touch the u.n. team assigned to the region was with the people. like almost all documentaries that don't have the word "women" in the title, this film fails to do a good job representing women's voices -- the majority of the talking done in interviews is that of men.maybe i need to watch the film a second time in order to catch some key points i might have missed, but i failed to detect sauper's theory of the relationship between the introduction of perch to lake victoria and the unjust living conditions for africans living near the lake. furthermore, i could be wrong, but it struck me that sauper could do well to improve his interview skills. not only did the questions he asked and the responses he included seem to be arbitrary, but he seemed to have a real knack for making interviewees awkward and uncomfortable.the most compelling development in the film is the suggestion that the exportation of perch now functions to mask the importation of arms and that the real economy screwing over tanzanians is that of war, not fishing. sadly, sauper shies away from conducting a thorough expose of the idea (or at least extending the interview with the reporter who seemed to know what he was talking about in regards to the weapons importation) and cops out with a "decide for yourself" approach.if darwin's nightmare was meant to dispel the myth that first world exploitation of the third world gives them "a chance for a better life," it didn't do a good job of it. if it was meant to depict how the weapons manufacturing industry in the u.s. and europe is responsible for much armed conflict around the world, it didn't do a good job of it. if it was meant to portray what drives people to prostitution, it didn't do a good job of it. if it was meant to cast light on the inability of the u.n. to carry out its mission, it didn't do a good job of it. if it was meant to say that meager income tanzanians earn from the perch isn't worth the human cost of tinkering with mother nature to create a profitable product, it didn't do a good job of it. if it was meant to imply that tanzania would be much better off had europeans never come, it didn't do a good job of it.

after having watched darwin's nightmare, one must have the impression of tanzania being a living hell, with its population being quasi-slaves delivering the finest fish to the well-fed europeans while leaving the fish bones to the starving population. in exchange for the fish they get western-made weapons, which the mainly unemployed population eagerly awaits to use, because being a soldier is their only source of income.so everything is all dark with trade as the incarnation of evil and source of all misery? not quite. fortunately darwin's nightmare shows the dark sides only and completely spares the positive aspects. in fact, the documentary hardly tells anything about the economic and ecologic importance the victoriaperch has for the region.for the countries around lake victoria the victoriaperch is the second to third most important source of income. the wages in the fishing industry are way above average. tanzania has banned huge trawlers to secure the jobs of thousands of fishermen. the adjacent states have met agreements to keep fishing on a sustainable level. cities at the lake are benefiting from the taxes the fishers have to pay for each kilogram caught fish and the taxes on the factories' exports and profits. furthermore tanzania has banned exporting the local traditional fish, which still play an important role feeding the local population.by ignoring those positive signs the documentary deters the badly needed western consumers and investors and thus threatens to aggravate the african's situation.for further reading i can recommend two articles the german alternative-wing newspaper wrote on the subject: http://www.taz.de/pt/2006/09/02/a0013.1/textdruck http://www.taz.de/pt/2005/03/17/a0151.1/text

this documentary was boring, and quite stupid.i mean... the documentary maker obviously does not even know what how darwinian evolution works? it is a theory, and the name is just plain dumb. reading a college biology text-book could have told the documentary maker what darwinism really is. darwinism is a good theory, but evil if it is done as politics.also there was no real evidence in this documentary just interviewing some people... no expert testimonies, and shady leads...the documentary was also boring. i mean it could have been edited down to 35 minutes, and then it would have been lots better.there are a lot better documentaries than this... this was not worth watching... you can get better information from wikipedia =d don't waste your money and time!

the title of this documentary is very misleading. at no time during the documentary do they show how the introduction of the nile perch fish into lake victoria has cause any of the problems facing the town of mwanza, tanzania. the film tries to place the problems of tanzania on an environmental cause but the truth of that matter is the problems stem from a parasitic outside force. the documentary is very slowing paced with no narrative what so ever. instead it relies on small blips of text between none related segments to display bits of information that do little to add or expand of the subject matter. there are only two attempts to discus the environmental effects of the nile perch fish. one is a small segment about 10 seconds long where they interview the factory managers where the fish is processed and he briefly mentions how 50 years ago the nile perch was introduced into the lake and it consumed the other fish species. the film maker makes no attempt to follow up on the matter or go deeper into it. the second attempt is when within this documentary they film the showing of another documentary that is discussing the environmental impact the nile perch has introduced, and again no real attempt is made to expand on just how devastating the problem has become. the subject matter that this documentary does delve into has nothing to do with the perch fish itself and more to do with the problems facing most african countries. the film tries to link the introduction of the perch fish with aids, poverty and pollution in tanzania but never makes a direct connection. as any intelligent person well read with problems in africa, the problems shown here are not unique to tanzania but affect most of africa and have nothing to do with the fish. it would have been great if the film makers would have shown how the local economy or life was before the fish was introduced and how it has been negatively impacted by the introduction of the fish but they don't. the fact of the matter is that many of the people they interview say that the fish has provided jobs and opportunity for many. yes things are bad within the town of mwanza but they are far worst in other parts of the country and continent for that matter.a weak attempt by the documentary makers to link the fish to famine problems in tanzania is quickly discredited by the documentary itself. first off tanzania is a very large country and lake victoria is only a small portion of the country. many of the individuals interview actually say that they can to mwanza, the fishing town on the lake, to find a job and feed their families because things were so bad in other parts of the country. this documentary is very weak, has no narrative and makes no attempt to actually link anything they display to the nile perch. it plays on people's emotions by displaying images of the devastation of poverty, famine and aids making no attempt to show you how any of this is unique to the lake victoria region of tanzania or directly related to the perch fish. the fact is most of the problems have more to do with war, globalization and christianity than and environmental effect of the perch fish itself.

i'm sorry to say that, but this is actually one of the worst documentaries i have ever seen.due to its name "darwin's nightmare" i expected a documentary on problems relating to the nile perch in lake victoria.what i actually saw in this "documentary" is a loose accumulation of individual stories, most of which have no relation to neither fish nor lake. and for a large part you can hardly call them stories - it's more like some accumulated scenes that lack a meaningful connection...why does this movie waste time on: - showing us non-relevant information on the families of the russian pilots (several minutes are wasted for example on their private digicam snapshots of wives and daughters) - mourning the death of an african child who got bitten by a crocodile (as if that could not have happened without the nile perch) - showing us about 100 times how planes land and start at the airport - showing us strange religious events for several minutes - discussing in detail the life and death of a whore at the airport - talking to kids about their mothers, fathers - what they work and/or how they died (well, guess what: some died of hiv - who would have guessed that?) those are just some examples, i could go on for several pages...this movie is absolutely unfocused, and does not know at all what it wants to tell the viewer. if you have never heard of africa and have no idea that this continent has social/health/hiv/violence/war problems then this movie might be right for you. if you haven't had your eyes closed for the last decades 90% of what this movie shows won't be new to you - and the way it's presented here will try its best to make you fall asleep.perhaps my expectations on this movie were to high, but i really didn't like it even though this is a topic that i would generally find interesting. if this movie wants to show how the poverty is related to the nile perch, than it perhaps should have spent some time on discussing that matter...

when exploiters become evangelist, they still exploit in the name of poverty! my first reaction after seeing the movie is  god bless me that i am not eating fish or any non-vegetarian products! the documentary is about lake victoria of tanzania where numerous varieties of lovely fishes used to live, and one day during 1960s somebody came and injected the mighty fish perch, who became the exportable commodity for tanzania to european and japanese markets. the consequences were severe  firstly all local small and big fish were extinct; secondly the plane that came to take the fish could not travel empty because it does not make commercial/ business/ capitalist sense, so it is filled with arms and ammunition (that is what europe can give this world); thirdly the pilots (as all migrants and traveling population like truck drivers) has to survive their sexual needs by flourishing cheap local african prostitutes for them; fourthly the brokers, dealers, middle men in the chain (mainly indian origin business people) get richer and tanzania's poverty remains the same; fifth poverty drives the children to crime, drugs etc.the premise to make this documentary was excellent. but has the director hubert sauper succeeded in making a good documentary? it is a big no. i say the reasons: like in india, it requires a higher caste brahmin to stand up and project to the world, indian poverty and untouchables; similarly it requires an austrain born european documentary maker to tell the world the story of tanzania and its crumbling and ruining economy and poverty. it is the pathetic motive of unaware breeding of that rich class (who have never seen poverty or known poor), who survives, live, earn and fame like pest hanging on to projecting poverty to the world as soon as they see it. there is nothing more but despise by poor people in african and india who see such images of their.the intention and motives of the hubert seems totally lop-sided. the images, characters, locales, interviews are too grave and murky, dark and disturbing. he uses exaggerated ignorance as a voice to present his case. what we feel in the end is pity and sadness for africans. we also start considering the tanzania government and people as villainous. may be some westerners sitting in their air-conditioned rooms would find time to discuss and debate about the pathetic living conditions of africans, but there would be nothing more than that.the director restrains to show himself even once on the screen  so as not to be identified among the europeans who exploit this poor country.this director hubert can only survive being exploiters themselves like today's cnn and bcc media giants. hubert did not have guts or common sense to talk to any europeans who eat or companies who import these fish products. a totally lop-sided flimsy effort! but i understand the reasons of the same  hubert just wanted to rake his fame, sitting and smiling with awards in his european comfort.no more words to spare for this pathetic effort. i hesitantly give the documentary a higher rating 3.5 stars out of 10, just because the theme was correct; but was pathetically exploited and blown away by amateurish ill conceived director made solely for un-intelligent western audiences! (stars 3.5 out of 10)

movies like this give independent films a bad name! this simply a boring compilation of vingettes, with no structure whatsoever. i wouldn't be surprised if the screenwriter was completely stoned. if you want to see a good stoner comedy, watch "half baked." it's no award-winner, but at least it made me laugh. the film was obviously made on a micro-budget. every scene either takes place in someone's house, someone's apartment or some outdoor location. if the writing was good and the dialogue was interesting, i would've ignored the film's budget (like in the case of edward burns' films), but obviously that's not the case this time around. i quote robert deniro from "a bronx tale" when i say, "there's nothing in the world worse than wasted talent." everybody in the cast is talented. luke wilson, alicia witt, brittany murphy, jeremy sisto--all talented performers! and they all have been in much better movies. the actors give it their all, but they couldn't go too far with such a lame script. the only scene i found interesting was jack black's cameo, where he sings a song about being in the woods. and of course, there was the brief strip club scene at the beginning, which i also found appealing. the characters are uninteresting and the story barely exists. many movies are awful, but at least you understand their intentions. what was "bongwater's" intention? the world will never know. my score: 2 (out of 10)

the title leads viewers to believe that this is a fun movie to watch and probably much better when watched under the influence, but it is not good at all. one 15 minute sequence with jack black beautifully playing one of his songs and tripping on acid while venturing through the woods does not save this movie at all. every actor in this movie has gone on to do better things, except for the main girls i could not think of one movie where i had seen them before. i hate to bash movies but i also hate not being able to find something decent in movies. the film is sad, not very funny and had such potential with its awesome cast. if it were redone and written over it could be awesome. if you want a good movie to see stoned, watch grandma's boy, or half baked or dazed and confused, but this is not a movie to be seen at all.

this film was one of the worst films i have ever seen. this movie drags on and on and i almost turned it off, but i gave it a shot. i wasnt expecting anything great, but i was expecting more than this. good thing i work at a video store and saw this for free, because i would'nt spend one dime on this movie. i gave this movie a 2, only because i have seen worse. if i were you i would stay away from this, very far away.

about 5 minutes into the movie you're thrown into this brutally tepid cat and mouse romance between the two main characters and it just gets worse from there. the biggest problem is the characters and how completely unbelievable they are. this is what 50 year old producers and out-of-touch hollywood script writers think stoner life is like, as if they gave the cast of friends some pot. bland, dull, annoying and completely unrealistic. i despise this movie.

absolutely nothing about this movie is funny, interesting, or relevant. besides two characters getting together at the end, nothing is ever resolved, and there is no plot. and by the way, what is the deal with the cover of the dvd? it has a female ass in daisy duke shorts... where was that scene in the movie? no one ever wore daisy dukes in this film! surprisingly enough, almost all of the acting in this film is good, and jack black plays a full song (could be a tenacious d track... don't know though)... those are the only redeeming values, though. overall, it's just a waste of time.

what a waste of a great cast. figured i'd check it out because it looked like a good stoner comedy with a lot of fairly well-known actors. what it turned out to be was a pointless collection of boring intertwining stories about several characters with minimal connections with each other. characters who start off looking like decent people but end up with not a single likable or interesting characteristic among them. calling it a comedy was a stretch as well...the only thing that made me chuckle was jack black's song, which was basically tenacious d. i waited for something big to happen but ended up with nothing more than 97 minutes of my life wasted.

it's hard to believe that with a cast as strong as this one has, that this movie can be such a dud. it's such an incredibly horrible film. how was it ever made? how did so many good actors wind up in such a terrible film? don't waste your life. don't watch even one moment of this film.

there is nothing in this that the viewer could point to and call "good". the acting was dull and sedated. the sets and cinematography look like they were developed by someone grew up in a starbucks and tried to make the perfect gap commercial. characters have no drive, motivation, or reason for us to care about them. there's such a lack of interest and tension that it's hard to follow the banal action and dialog. and the plot... if anyone finds it, i'm sure it would be as boring as everything else.this isn't funny, it's not romantic, it doesn't reflect on the human condition. if you want a good stoner comedy, watch half-baked; if you want a good stoner drama, watch trainspotting. the only reason i gave this 2 stars instead of one is because it's kind of fun seeing some familiar faces in the mid-late 90's cast. which is a shallow reason to give the film even one star, but, then again, this is a shallow movie.

it starts out looking like it may be going somewhere, then quickly leads the main characters into a three-ring circus of remarkable stupidity which permanently destroys any likability of the characters. i'm a huge collector of stoner movies, but this is something i would not consider a valid addition. bong water is trash from the very deepest regions of the dumpster, and i wouldn't be caught dead with this on my shelf. i'm actually convinced this movie was created by a partnership for a drug free america. if you're a jack black fan then i would say that you may think 5 minutes of the movies is ok because jack black continues his legacy of singing songs for retards. i really can't say enough bad things about this movie.

if this is the author's and director's idea of a slice of life, they are clinically manic depressives. a sad, moody film at best, with ubiquitously aimless and unhappy characters who negatively interact with disastrous results. this film is billed as a comedy. what was so funny about losing your home to an allegedly premeditated arson or the drug induced, forcible rape of one of the main characters. is this art imitating life? jack black was mildly amusing as the mountain man, weed farmer. however, even this segment of the film was rife with pathos. what was the point of living in the middle of nowhere with an entourage. if black's character was so paranoid, why was he doing acid with a group of people right out of woodstock? is there no end to disconnected relationships, a plot less script, and scene transitions lacking any cohesiveness or logical chronology.

i lived next door to the author in 1980 when he first moved out to portland from downer's grove, ill. with two of his high school buds. he seemed like a normal-enough guy, though he had a lot of artistic pretensions. within a few years, he jumped into portland's post-punk music scene with buddy phil and a few others, and a band that definitely wasn't headed anywhere, although it got him a lot of action, including a fling with courtney love in her portland groupie days. he seemed to think his musical prospects were good enough to move to san francisco, then n.y.c.i was surprised to hear that he got a publishing deal in '95 after the band crashed and burned. courtney love's name seemed to be the clincher. i have no idea how the movie came about, especially with this cast, but i doubt that gus van sant was involved. anyway, the reviewers here seem to be unsure whether the lack of narrative focus is intentional or not, so i would just say that this is the work of a fairly intelligent guy who wants to be a writer, or artist or something, but doesn't have anything to say. like kerouac without the benzedrine.

did anyone notice?when miss brook went skinny dipping,she left the water wearing white bikini bottoms and yet had previously taken it all off to join cabin boy.this could have been a good film without miss brooks phony accent and a year on the island please.how come that kelly looked always clean and ready for a fm photo shoot.what started out with premise turned in to soft porn.and billy zane come on,you cant be that hard up for film offers.check out dead calm.also when the people took her away ,how come she scoffed her face and after all that time didn't feel like throwing up.i suggest billy find decent scripts,kelly stick to photo shoots and cabin boy play the son of zorro in a future sequel.

yes, bad acting isn't only one thing to mention. bad script,not so bad music. unfortunately.nice girl and nice boy with perfect bodies and super teeth just isn't enough for me and for you too.first thing in the morning after crash they go to swim to the sea, to have some fun !!! smiling ...they find everything in the sea. i mean things like fishing-net, knife, scuba dive things, ropes, bottles, husband ...woodoo stuff , are you kidding. stupid. they are so happy on the island, they are going to die, and they are happy. love, peace. love. just stupid.terrible, skip this one please.

i can only assume the previous posts came from execs at the production company...attended the uk premiere last night. zane and brook attended (they probably knew i was gonna be there) and are undoubtedly stars, but what a turkey of a film. i felt sorry for them at times, when the audience erupted in laughter at what were serious 'thriller' scenes.but perhaps i was missing the point. perhaps an element of tongue-in-cheek was intended. if so, pure genius. if not, career genocide.on the plus side, zane always shines, and brook can actually act a little. as the other half said (as we ran out the cinema, avec broken ribs), they can be forgiven for this film as they both seem like nice people! the scriptwriter, however, should be marooned.

a holiday on a boat, a married couple, an angry waiter and a shipwreck is the reason to this films beginning.i like boobs. no question about that. but when the main character allies with whoever happens to have the most fish at the moment, mostly by having sex with them and playing the role of the constant victim, my anger just rises to a whole new level. take two guys (a husband and another man), put a pure bombshell woman in the middle of them, ad a deserted island, subtract all her moral issues, ad a whole bunch of moral issues to the men and mix it in a big bowl of arguments, fish and a zippo lighter and you will come up with a piece of junk movie like this. the acting is, i would say, good. there are some bloopers but not many as far as i could see. the main female character makes me sick. this is due to her lack of moral values. the man with the most fish get's her attention. even though one of them is her husband, she sees no problem with being unfaithful with (manuel) the other man because "i must do it to survive". how can you justify having sex with another man for fish when your husband is 30feet away? and he won't even benefit from it? the female character has absolutely no problems to justify anything that she does. if she doesen't get approval for her actions, she's a victim.i recommend everyone to see this movie. this is the kind of movie that will make just about everything else you see this year a pleasant movie experience.

how pointless, hideous characters and boring film. saved by brief sex scenes, mad witch, gorgeous desert island and brooks body. the plot is tenuous, the characters are shallow and unlikeable. having said that i did manage to watch it all, mainly because i was totally transfixed by the jiggling and kind of hoping that her character would come good in the end. the film was well shot, well directed but perhaps the casting let it down in some ways. disappointing. really summed the review up in the first line but this website dictates that you need to write 10 lines minimum. it would be better to spend the time watching another film.

the three stooges are arguably the greatest comedy team in film history. for that reason alone, they deserved a much better ending at columbia than they received with this short."sappy bullfighters" is just not good. granted, this is not all joe besser's fault. i personally feel that some of his shorts are fun enough, simply because of the departure from the stooges usual fanfare that they contain, and for the fact that larry is sometimes showcased more. however, this short just will not do. and the fact that one knows that it is their last short that was ever shown, well that just adds to the overall disgust.this film just epitomizes how short subjects were on their last dying breaths during this time and how little effort went into making them. this short is so sloppy. it is a simple re-make of a curly short, "what's the matador?", filmed years before. as if this fact wasn't bad enough, the studio actually threw in footage of moe and larry from the original (which was filmed nearly 20 years prior). are these things not obvious? laughable or sad? you be the judge.another part of this short that makes it miserable is the fact that it is basically a joe besser showcase, with him showing that all he is (at least in this film) is a curly-wanna-be-gone-completely-wrong! moe and larry have little to do in this short. as a larry fan, i also must say that i feel it a bit disgraceful to have besser get to use the joke that larry originally popularized in the short "ants in the pantry". to see besser say "i can't see, i can't see!" and have larry say the simple "why can't you see?", while besser gets to quip "i got my eyes closed", is just wrong on all levels.the two brave soldiers who stuck it out for all those years, howard and fine, have so little to do in this short. there are hardly any funny bits with them. the only thing that qualifies is larry hiding under the bed of a jealous husband, attempting to be "pepe", his dog.one can't blame the dynamic duo. larry and moe give it their all. no matter how ridiculous things could get (and i'm sure they had their opinions by this point in their careers) howard and fine never gave anything less than their best. their efforts do not pale from 1934-1959.i often enjoy many shorts that some will dismiss as horrible. i'm all for their more "experimental", unusual shorts. at least those contain new ideas. however, this short, i think everyone can agree, is just not good.thank goodness tv later discovered the boys after the shorts department closed. had they been forced to go out in this fashion, well that would have been a gross injustice to all the years they invested in making audiences laugh.

these writers are trying to re-create the characters they have on "scrubs" in a different occupation however the characters they are stuck with have no charisma or acting ability not to mention the writing seems poor and effortless. these guys are trying to create something that would be good if the writing wasn't so disgusting which is leaving the shows only lifeline to be two attractive teachers that that are barely keeping it alive. the humor in this show seems like it is trying to target an audience with an i.q. of 40 or below. another reason why this show is becoming a failure could be that the writing on the show "scrubs" is excellent and this show has to follow it up leaving the viewer in an odd position not knowing whether to cry or to just lose hope in new sitcoms all together. this is just my opinion but i think these guys should stop now before they humiliate themselves anymore than they have already.

the worst wrestlemania ever.this had no must see bouts and many crap ones at that. this took place in las vegas and wwe made it's employees dress up like egyptian gods! they even changed howard finkels name to finkus maximus, which probably doesn't mean anything. the sight of seeing jim ross in that terrible gown still gives me nightmares to this day and i'm 21 years old, so you could imagine it when i was 7 years old! bobby heenan was funny though.matches included the undertaker vs giant gonzales in a p*ss poor match, the headshrinkers vs the steiner brothers in a useless match, doink vs crush in a comedy match and a boring match featuring razor ramon vs bob backlund. hulk hogan teamed up with brutus beefcake to battle money inc. you could clearly see hogan had a black eye. in storyline purposes ted dibiase and irs beat up hogan while he was playing poker or something like that in the casinos, which is a poor storyline, but in reality, macho man randy savage hit hogan because savage thinks he's like the hulk (no pun intended) no not the wrestler but the film character.the main event consisted of bret 'hitman' hart facing off against yokozuna in a very boring main event match. mr fuji threw salt in the face of hart and yoko won, but not until hogan came down and squashed yoko in 21 seconds.overall grade - e

ugh!...this is the worst wrestlemania hands down....no good matches.....hulk hogan rears his over tanned bald head yet again in the main event, the spot light hoggin scum!....not one thing note worthy on this tape, oh..i take that back...this is jim ross's first wm...but other than that....it has nothing worth seein....a major bust...1 out of 10 stars woof!!!

1993 was a time of change in the wwe but for this wrestlemania they decided to wind back the clock as hulk hogan returned, along with his good friend brutus beefcake, who had been out of wrestling since a paragliding accident in 1990.this was not a great event. only two matches had any real build and the whole thing came off as being rushed. the in ring action wasn't great and the twist at the end, which i'll discuss later, really wasn't the earth shattering moment the wwe hoped it would be.this forgettable night started off with shawn micheals defending his intercontinental championship against the undefeated tatanka. tatanka had beaten michaels a couple of times leading into the fight. michaels had a new manager, luna vachon while tatanka was accompanied by michaels' former manager and future wwe hall of famer sherri martel. tatanka won by dq. michaels kept his title and went straight back into his feud with marty janetty, which had been put on hold just for wrestlemania. why, i have no idea.next up saw the steiner brothers (scott and rick) defeat the headshrinkers (samu and fatu) with scott scoring the pin after hitting samu with the frankensteiner. good match.doink the clown needed help from another clown to win his match against crush. a second doink distracting crush when he was in complete control and allowing doink to get the pin and the victory. doink was an entertaining gimmick character, who got old rather quickly.razor ramon easily defeated the returning bob backlund in the next match.this brings us to the first in our double main event. as the mega maniacs team of hulk hogan and brutus beefcake, with the newly turned good guy jimmy hart in their corner, took on hart's former buddies money inc (ted dibiase and irwin r shyster). this was a fairly sketchy finish. beefcake, as mentioned, had been in a paragliding accident requiring full facial surgery and had wrestled the match with a face mask on. shyster ripped the mask off him and beat beefcake to a pulp. the ref went down, hogan grabbed the face mask and knocked out dibiase and shyster and then hart, who was wearing a referee shirt, counted the three. another ref came down and reversed the decision, declaring money inc winners by dq.next up lex luger or the narcissist as he was also known at the time defeated mr perfect. this match came about because luger was being managed by perfect's old manager bobby heenan. perfect had is feet on the ropes when he was pinned, but the ref missed it.the undertaker picked up a lacklustre dq victory in a pretty poor match against the giant gonzales. the undertaker had earned the ire of gonzales' manager harvey wippleman in 1992 and taker had defeated his big monster kamala at survivor series. wippleman vowed revenge and took it at the royal rumble as gonzales attacked taker, costing him the match. gonzales dominated undertaker in this match, but was dq'd for choking taker out with chloroform. weird finish to a bad match.this bought us to our main event as wwe champion bret hart, seriously challenged as champion for the first time, put his title on the line against mr fuji's unstoppable monster yokozuna. yokozuna controlled the early going, but hart resisted and then took control. he had yokozuna in the sharpshooter, surely he would give in and hart would be established as an heroic hero after taking out the big monster. but fuji had other ideas, throwing salt in hart's face, rendering the canadian helpless as yokozuna got the pin.what a downer ending. but wait here comes hulk hogan. he's checking hart to make sure he's ok. suddenly fuji challenges hogan to a wwe title right then and there. hogan accepts. fuji throws salt towards hogan, but hits yokozuna instead. hogan hits the leg drop and wins the match and the title. what did i just watch? and so, what most fans thought was going to be the night we either saw hart establish himself as a giant killer, or yokozuna establish himself as an unstoppable monster, we instead saw hulk hogan pick up a meaningless title win. a title that he would not defend for three months. as a matter of fact this was the only match hogan wrestled for the wwe before the king of the ring ppv in june 1993.

i liked the whole set up with ceasar's palace, the roman guards, and announcers in togas. this event also marked "the passing of the torch" as far as the voice of the wwf goes. gorilla monsoon who had done the play by play for every wwf ppv up to this point opens up and gives the typical introduction making it look like he's there to announce another ppv. but then introduces jim ross who is making his wwf debut and jr continues to do the wwf commentary to this day. but outside of that, this event is pure garbage. good ol scientific wrestling has been thrown out the window and enter the birth of gimmicks. this to me was the event that the wwf started to go down the toilet, and didn't recover until the attitude era of the late 90's. here's a review of the event.ic title match: tatanka (challenger) vs. shawn michaels (champ): an okay opener, but given what shawn is capable of, it was very disappointing. i have no idea why the wwf was hell bent on putting tatanka over. they should of realized that shawn was the future and tatanka was just some hyper wrestler in an indian gimick. the ending of the match itself was very lame. shawn grabs the ref and pulls him out, then gets called for a count out. while it was fun watching sherri get beat up afterwords, this match just was forgettable. shawn had to carry this match and had trouble doing it.the stenier brothers vs. the headshrinkers: steiners get the win via a franknsteiner. this match had it's moments, but the crowd just didn't seem into it. there was no heat behind it, i think it was a match just to throw two tag teams in.crush vs. doink the clown: terrible! terrible! terrible! this match completely sucked. two very lame gimmicks. a clown and a hawaiian dressed in bizarre colors. the ending caught everybody by surprise. in the upcoming months, crush turned heel and doink turned face, but none of the fans seem to care. sadly, this was not the worst match on the card.razor ramon vs. bob backland: you got a brand new heel that is very over going against a wrestler who was forgotten about 10 years ago. the fans snicker and laugh when backlund comes out. and like hogan/rock in wm18 and hhh/owen in wm14, the heel wrestler gets louder cheers in the face. thankfully this match was short. the right guy won, but i wish they had razor totally beat the crap out of and squash backlund rather than winning by a small package out of nowhere.tag team champion match: ted dibiase and irs (champs) vs. hulk hogan & brutus beefcake w/jimmy hart i still would like to know the full story on what happened to hogan's eye. oh well. the crowd was really into this match, but it had no flow to it what so ever. hogan and beefcake were clearly suffering ring rust given that both wrestlers had been on the shelf for at least a year. dibiase, being the great technical wrestler that he was, did help to carry the match from being a complete waste. the ending was a surprise with dibiase and irs getting the win via dq. but to please the crowd, hogan and beefcake did their usual playing to the crowd at the end like they had won the match.lex luger vs. mr. perfect: the best part of this match was the four hot chicks that accompanied lex luger to the ring. other than that, this was completely forgettable. the mr. perfect gimmick was born for a heel role and he just lacked the heat as a face. and luger is just a waste of time no matter what gimmick he's in. luger wins via a backslide despite that perfect's feet were in the ropes. then perfect spends the post match getting his butt kicked. first luger knocks him out with the running elbow. then when perfect regains consciousness he goes back to the dressing room to find luger only to get the crap beaten out of him by shawn michaels, setting up an hbk/perfect feud that had the potential to be a classic but the wwf misused.the undertaker vs. giant gonzales: absolute crap!! what was the wwf thinking bringing in such a horrible wrestler as giant gonzales. sure he had size, but i'd rather watch the brooklyn brawler in a match than him. this isn't even worth commenting on.wwf championship match: bret hart (champ) vs. yokozuna (challenger) you have one of the greatest technical wrestlers of all time going against a guy who's only advantage is that he's a gigantic lard ass. bret was able to carry the match, but a rather predictable ending with mr. fuji throwing salt in bret's face.post match: yokozuna vs. hulk hogan pure crap right here. hogan comes down to the ring for no apparent reason and mr. fuji challenges him to a match after yoko just won the title. even the die-hard hulkamaniacs find this to be total bs.

for any wrestling fan, this is the wrestlemania to forget. no logic to the matches, some garbage gimmicks (doink the clown, and the giant gonzalez) this was a forgettable ppv something rare for the wwe(f). the logic of hogan winning the world title at the end made no sense, and many people feel that alone help put the nail in the ppv. from the meaningless gimmicks of the roman soldiers, to simply some real bad wrestling (doink vs crush being the worst match) to simply bad match making (scott "razor ramon vs bob backlund, how can you have one of the greatest mat wrestlers, making a comeback, and working his first wrestlemania, face a power wrestler who was undefeated at the time), this is a ppv that even the wwe has since admitted, was way below what the expected. just all around a stinker

this movie was a waste of time. it looks nice, pretty settings, nicely acted, appears earnest and seems to be leading somewhere so you stay tuned awaiting a meaningful payoff. it doesn't happen. it surprised me that so much effort could be put into a movie, it was clearly very professionally done, and have an outcome that seems nothing short of a b-movie.save your precious time and see a good french film like les visiteurs (funny), jean de florette or manon of the spring. i can't recall the language in europa europa, but that's another great film--heavy but very worth viewing.this film appears to promise a lot but delivers nothing.

i think it is very interesting this movie is called a thriller. it is anything but thrilling.most of the time you hear piano sounds. then you hear piano sounds. then some people talk about facts which do not concern anybody.then again piano sounds.to be honest, this movie was the reason for me to register at imdb, because i think this movie is one of those which humankind has to be warned of.spoiler: by the way, the most action-like part happens when a can of hot chocolate is spilled.also very interesting: the "actors". yes, the quotes are intentional, as you can think, because they do not act. they play piano and do smalltalk, but it's not acting they do.i think before this movie i never left a cinema and felt angry. really, this film made me angry. angry for the time and money i spent on it.

something does not work in this movie. there are absolutely no energies between the actors. in fact, their very acting seems frozen, sometimes amateur. also, the script is not convincing and not reliable.

the dominating conflict is between a couple of fine actors (huppert and dutronc) and the horrible script. evidently, the actors lost, since the director/screenwriter claude chabrol eventually forced the leading couple to follow this worthless piece of sick imagination to the letter. fortunately, the powerful performances by huppert and dutronc dramatically improve the overall quality of the movie, which miraculously gains the depth and humor. as for chabrol's persistence in keeping the film bland and illogical, it reaches the climax in the final scene, which is so incredibly poor that you will wonder which pills he was taking himself while directing it.

the french either make pro-marxist films or anti-marxist films - with a few in between. "merci pour le chocolat" is the latter of this genre. from the opening credits telling the viewer what music is going to be played and by whom it was who composed you know that you are going to be swathed in middle class pretension. it is an old man's film with an excess of 40's plus people. it is also directed by an old man along with an old crew who have nothing to say about life to the viewer. the plot is not only banal but preposterous. how many films reveal the plot through dialogue only to repeat the same message via flashback some five minutes later? maybe the director and actors had a low retentive capacity? in truth their is no tenable plot at all. it is riddle with holes like a good piece of french cheese.whether intentional or not, it is a film about the bourgeoisie. at least a third of the film focuses on the piano and the pretentious twaddle espoused in each scene. i concede it has some well framed shots though they couldn't have used a steady-cam in this film - it would have woke them all up! other than it being a nonsense story, the film allows the upper middle class to parade their values and vanity in a very comfortable swiss location. a telling line of the film is when rodolphe pauly tells anna mouglalis that she need not lock her car while in the resort! oh dear me.on the dvd, miss huppert makes a comment about shedding a false tear for a scene. smirking she says: "like they do in the american actor's studio!" i think miss huppert and the rest of the cast could learn well from the actor's studio.if there is one statement that stand out in my mind it is when huppert remarks 'we are having friends for the weekend and all the servants are away'. no doubt they had all escaped from the mind numbing set lest they be associated with such an appalling film.safety medical note. in the film they show a hot water scald being covered with ointment and a bandage. this should never be done. only cold water should be used.minus 10 marks.

the beginning of the film is promising. when jeanne pollet(anna mouglalis) hear the story of the incident that happen on the day she was born that raise the possibility that she is the daughter of a famous pianist, andré polonski (jacques dutrone), she set to find out whether it's true or not, and giving the fact the she plays also the piano that's not such a remote idea. jeanne meet andré and his wife "mika" muller(isabelle huppert) and their son and on the way uncover the fact that there are some secrets in that family as much in her own.o.k. we have seen this before and it has been done in a more interesting way than here.the character of "mika" muller is left with out us understanding her motives to her action and she is not interesting enough to care for her. the piano scenes look fake and the whole piano sub-plot doesn't add anything to the character's insight but serve as to make the film longer than it should have been in the first place.in short a very disappointing outing from chabrol, who can do better than this

i did not like this film at all: the scenario is boring - and after a while, its primitive predictability really gets on your nerves. even if you give chabrol a high bonus for not being a beginner, i did not manage to find anything specially interesting on his characterization of mika neither.

this is the second adaptation of charlotte armstrong by claude chabrol for the screen:the first was " la rupture" (1970)(from novel "the balloon man" )and it's really a pity no one cares about it.it's chabrol's sleeper,and i urge any of his fans to see it."the chocolate" cobweb was not that strong a detective story to begin with.i read it 20 years ago and forgot all about it.the movie promises some good things at first,though,then finally disappoints to a fault.this is a confusing chabrol movie,mixing elements of the heyday (circa 1969),and a lotta tongue-in-chick stuff coming from the eighties ,the likes of 'poulet au vinaigre",not one particularly memorable work.part of the disappointment comes from the cast:this is a distressingly poor gathering:jacques dutronc plays like a zombie,isabelle huppert reveals herself a somewhat limited actress,finally rather vulgar .it worked in "une affaire de femme",it does not here.they are not supported by the young couple :both are bland and unremarkable.actors from the past,say,stephane audran or michel bouquet(both in "la rupture") were brilliant and contributed to chabrol's then unique atmosphere.the story itself is undistinguished:beginning as some kind of "serious" "la vie est un long fleuve tranquille " (besides,a character hints at etienne chatilliez's very funny movie),the movie drags on and on as a laughable psychological drama afterwards.we will not congratulate the young female pianist ,who,after all she learned about her wicked hostess,agrees to drive a car along a dangerous road.because he makes too many movies,chabrol frequently releases turkeys.one wonder why people who wants to watch one of his movies should choose this one among all his stuff up for grabs.it seems that chabrol's bourgeoise satire has finally given way to leniency.in "la rupture" the first armstrong adaptation-an average detective story which chabrol completely transcended-,you should hear audran say "they have so much money!".here ,chabrol has lost his bite,his strength.

oh boy, oh boy. this movie is something for the lovers of "real" cineatique art. it really does not make any sense at all. it is totally boring, especially because of the "anti-climaxes". all people behave more than strange, and unrealistic. sometimes it feels like sitting in a theatre, because in dialogues the actors tend to face the camera (and therefore the audience) instead of each other. like i said before, if you are in to those more artful movies, shown in cannes - go for it. if you are not, better leave this movie alone, because you will be more than disappointed, and in the end know that you have wasted your time - like i did. two thumbs down... :-(((

before going any further, i have to admit that i only saw the first episode of this show. if i had the time, i might have considered watching it every week, if only to see how the season played out. however, it was very clear to me from the beginning that martha stewart's version of "the apprentice" just doesn't "fit in." martha stewart made a career of being a happy homemaker, a domestic diva of the likes of oprah winfrey and julia child. it was only since her scandalous legal troubles and subsequent incarceration that her public image began to reflect the true roughness of her character. sure, she was compelling for a while, and this entire series poses the interesting question of what it means to be a woman in business. does she have to come off as cold and tough? shouldn't she?but the truth was, by the time stewart came out of prison, her attempts for a public comeback, though certainly warranted, were never going to seize viewers' interest for very long. perhaps a true comeback would have worked had she returned home peacefully and waited a year or so after her often mocked ankle bracelet was removed. instead, she frantically dove into overkill with 2 series at once, the other being her syndicated daytime series martha, much like her old show, but more mainstream, with famous guests like bette midler. of course, even at her peak stewart was never mainstream, so it's too much to ask that american audiences immediately accept her foray into reality tv. maybe america wants stewart to make a comeback on her own rather than be the basis for it.the show was basically a tired retread of trump's "apprentice," which still holds my interest, depending on the tasks, the cast, and trump's firing decisions (often controversial - likely for that reason). the letter bit was certainly not cliché but obnoxious in the least. the fact that stewart never says, "you're fired!" - mentioned in the message board on this site - is particularly distressing. producer mark burnett should be admired for dealing with stewart's jail time honestly while trying to make her a hero, but the truth is that anyone watching can tell that she's basically trying to put on a show of being this nice businesswoman. again never mainstream, stewart lacks the agreeability and identifiability of oprah winfrey and the admirable, charismatic "toughness" of donald trump. yes, this can be a gender-biased assessment of her character, but i mean it to be more about the nature of her business.it comes as no shock that stewart has been fired, but i wonder if they really always intended it to only last for one season?

jesus christ, what the hell happened here?. this is one of the most boring movies i have ever seen, how is it possible that they screwed up such a nice idea for a movie. to tell you the truth i was so hyped for this, i though it was like blair witch but with actual alien creatures chasing the camera guy. goddamn it, i have been reduced to fast forwarding this pile of sh*t, and i never do that while seeing movies. the high rating here on imdb makes me believe that actual aliens are giving 10's for this piece of crap.invasion is about well, an invasion. the movie starts by saying that everything you're about to see is real, blahblahblah. then they go and tell me about a special camera system used in cars, as if i need to believe their bullsh*t to enjoy this movie. next thing you know i'm seeing the most boring car driving ever filmed, in a forest at night mind you. is this a movie, or a disney theme park ride? the first 20 minutes is all boring dialog between cops while seeing grass and one straight road with a flashlight. where the hell were the aliens?! they were sleeping of course! then we learn that bad acting is not only reduced to high school plays, as the cop behind the camera goes out of his car to look for a missing man who was 'nightfishing' and had stumbled upon a mysterious meteorite. i wonder what happens to him? out of nowhere, we see the 'nightfishing' guy walking like a zombie. the cop is apparently too dumb to notice that something is wrong with this man. apparently he was indeed dumb, as the zombie/alien guy injects in the cop's ear some sort of alien parasite, thus changing him into an alien. then the cop/alien goes back into his car, looks for a young couple that were having sex a while back in the forest, gets to them, changes the guy into an alien, and then the girl runs to the cop's car and escapes. if this quick plot introduction didn't get it in your head that this movie was bad, then the following 40 minutes will. watching this movie is as painful as stabbing yourself repeatedly with a plastic fork. the script, while it may sound interesting on the back of the dvd box, is badly directed and sadly, we are left with another boring straight to dvd atrocity.the only thing that kept me awake were the constant flashing and loud sound effects (lamentably). if seeing the same forest trail for 63 minutes is not enough, we must endure crappy flashing techniques to "scare" the viewer and constant wailing of a bad actress that gets old and annoying pretty quick.if you feel you must rent this, i say to you, why? there are better scifi/horror films out there. even the dreaded remake of the invasion of the body snatchers is more entertaining than this. for the love of all things good, don't bother with his crap. my eyes bled, and for the first time, i wanted suicide. a 1/10, avoid this like a disease.

here is a fantastic concept for a film - a series of meteors crash into a small town and the resulting alien infection is caught on a deputy's single camera dash cam as the town slowly taken over. leave it to albert pyun to screw that up! don't get within 100 feet of this flick! holy crap, what a bomb...it might be pyun's worst yet! the crazy thing is there is the germ of a creative idea in here - an entire of an outbreak told from the pov of a dashcam. when i heard that a while back, i imagined the car smashing into stuff, people getting run over, and infected types breaking the windshield and surrounding the car in chaos. that would be cool right? instead, we have the lead driving around in circles for the entire time in a wooded area, occasionally running into the three infected types who just stand there. the last bit is literally a 15 minute shot where nothing happens in front of the camera, just noises are heard offscreen. stay away!!! on a somewhat relieving note, i think i am officially calling an end to my pyun watching...only took me 20 crappy movies to realize i have better things to do.

okay, first i should say that i assume this was just made by a group of friends with a limited budget. with that in mind, it really shouldn't be compared to blockbuster features and my rating would be higher. but still...after giving it a chance, it still violated some basic film-making rules to such an extent that both the viewer and the amateur director in me cringed. a lot.think: blair witch in a car but really boring.think: you left your camcorder on the dashboard and recorded yourself getting lost in the park at night for an hour, then making your friends watch it.the scariest part (possible spoiler alert... if spoiling here is possible) was at one point the picture rewinds and you might think you will have to watch it all over again. scary.silliness aside, this is a pretty good idea for a low-budget lets-go-make-a-movie-tonight film. but the concept walks a fine line between being really good and really bad, and let's just say it wasn't really good. there were just too many parts where nothing happened. at first i thought that was the director's plan -- you were supposed to be lulled into a sense of security and then really scary things would start happening. but...no.i kept trying to find good things to say about it (and i had plenty of time to think), and i'll say the music was kinda cool. and i have to give the female lead credit for standing around by herself looking scared for a really, really long time. but that's it. the actors playing "infected" people looked as if they were making fun of zombie movies. or they got their motivation from the bug wearing his edgar suit from "mib." chances are, if for some strange reason you're going to watch this movie, it's on dvd or tivo, so you can fast forward it whenever waiting for something to happen gets too difficult.i hate to be so critical of something, but at the same time i've watched a lot of similar movies and nothing has ever been this painful. if they just chopped a half an hour out of it and added some scary stuff, it might be decent. maybe that'll be the director's cut...

unfortunately house of d is just awful, with a ridiculous plot, terrible writing, some mediocre acting, and in fact just about everything else about it is sub-par.tom flees nyc to somehow survive as a lone child in paris, and manages to convince the beautiful parisian girl he eventually marries that he's french, despite a poor grasp of her language. she's shocked when years later he reveals his "secret" to her! riiiight!he then "gifts" his tale of woe to his own son, and who we are expected to believe thinks that's just the greatest birthday gift a dad can give his 13 year old boy. if only such things were so easy! david duchovny miscasts his own wife tea leoni in the role of his mother and strikes out yet again. leoni makes me laugh as a comic but she's just plain wrong for this role.one of the problems with that is none of the characters are sympathetic. i just didn't give a damn what happened to any of them. i did rather hope that robin williams and his trademark "child in a grown-up's body" schtick would fall into a village pothole, but alas, it was not to be and we had to endure his simpering performance all the way.anton yelchin and william's daughter zelda were not bad, but i suspect the rave reviews others are giving them is simply because they weren't anywhere near as bad as everyone else in this movie. they weren't great, let me put it that way.there are so many silly and contrived aspects to this film - erykah badu, the bicycle, the catholic school and it's staff of morons, the conveniently stupid characters, etc - that this review would go on for ever, so i'll just finish up by saying that house of d is a very poor movie, and i'm almost embarrassed for duchovny.the thing that really annoys me is how i was so strongly encouraged by online "friends" to see this that i traveled a long way to do so.i would not have been so annoyed that this movie is so bad if i'd just wasted a couple of hours down at the local movie theater, but instead i lost a whole day, and discovered that my so-called "friends" are either stupid or dishonest, because this is an awful movie!

stop me if you hard this one before, some cheerleaders, their coach and a couple guys are trapped within a cabin in the woods when an unseen killer kills them off one by one. shame on me, after i totally wrote off jim wynorski after the horrid "busty cops" (it was a long time coming as his last truly good film was 1990's "hard to die"), i still for some reason got my hopes up for a supposed sequel to "slumber party massacre". sadly even my mediocre expectations were not met. this outing is not nearly as fun as even the three previous films in the franchise (and yes i'm including spm 2, that should tell you something) furthermore how can you have a slasher film with this little gore??? i mean come on now!! my grade: d eye candy: ricky ray gets topless; april flowers and charity rahmer show boobs and buns in a shower scene (april gets nude again later in the film), and tamie sheffield gets topless and bares buns

mad scientist professor tabani drinks a potion he has brewed up in his laboratory but is turned into a blood craving vampire instead.when dr.aqil pays a visit tabani sees a picture of aqil's wife shabnam and,after turning aqil into a vampire,heads for shabnam to make her his bride.aqil's brother discovers the grave of the vampire and his brother at tabani's castle and kills his brother with a knife to free his soul.tabani succeeds in putting the bite on shabnam and once turned she tries to lure her young niece away.aqil's brother races against time to put a stop to the vampire curse."zinda laash" almost put me to sleep.the plot is extremely slow but more or less follows bram stoker's famous novel.the suspense is completely absent as is the gore and nudity.the film is only recommended for curious horror fans that want to see the second horror film made in pakistan(after "madman" from 1964).

i normally finish every movie or book i start, even if they're poor, just 'cause i hate giving up on them. this was so poorly made, i was in disbelief.i'm not just looking for spielberg magic - i rent foreign films, and i rent really old sci-fi's (most recently soylent green - worth the rent). i like both hollywood action and slower moving character development. different films need to be approached differently to be appreciated. i could find no redeeming element to this one... the action was so wooden i wasn't the least bit on edge. the character development was virtually absent - you're not left feeling sorry for anyone, or even identifying with them. finally, there were so many pieces that just didn't add up.don't waste your time - better to watch paint dry...

kk should stick to singing- this whole movie was a big bore. i can't understand the viciousness of the boys and the romance between miles and kk- the sex scenes were uninspired too. the ending was awful- unresolved- there needs to be reason to murder. and the whole voyeurism of the boy was weird..... the mother always wrestled with the boy- don't you think he would get some rather freudian with her? and why didn't someone teach kk how to speak with inflection instead of monotone?glad i only paid $1.00 to rent this. 

the movie is an adaptation of a japanese story by the respected author yukio mishima. it simply doesn't make the transition into a credible story about brits and americans.the story moves sluggishly, especially the part where miles and kristofferson are separated and the director fills in with the cliched shots of a ship's prow cutting through the waves, and the little route line filling in on the maps, while their letters are heard in overvoice. the film moves so languidly that i even fast-forwarded through the sex and masturbation scenes which, although long, are not really either passionate or erotic. the film did achieve a measure of notoriety when kristofferson's then-wife divorced him for extra-curricular activities with miss miles during the filming. i guess they enjoyed the sex scenes, but it isn't quite the same for a viewer.there are no characters to hang on to. the sexually frustrated widow is unlikeable, the little kid is detestable. kristofferson is amiable enough, but he just doesn't have the acting skills to bring much to the role, although perhaps we don't really want get too involved with him, considering his ultimate fate.as for the little kid, well, he kinda falls in with a bad crowd after his dad dies, and they help him plot some evil against the man who enters his mum's life. now this is a really bad crowd. they don't just shoplift and smoke dope, nosireebib. they slip a mickey to a cat and vivisect it. this is shown in gory detail. but of course, this is only practice so they can do the same thing to kristofferson!so the movie mostly moves slowly, with no characters to relate to, and when something does happen it is unrelentingly morbid.the ending is about as unsatisfying as any movie you'll ever see.this all might have made some sense if the japanese locale and cultural context had been retained. as it stands, it is just abysmal.

distasteful british film from a japanese novel about a very troubled young man who comes under the influence of a hitler-like classmate and plots to harm his widowed mother's lover. a couple of good scenes (sarah miles discovering her son has been peeping at her and confronts him in anger, the pasty-faced lad trying to ensnare kris kristofferson to his demise by being extra friendly), but what's the point beyond provoking shock? ugly and uneasy, it doesn't showcase anyone involved to any advantage (especially kristofferson, whose hollow stares and usual gravelly talk is out-of-place in a psychological mishmash like this one). coldly without any sense of its own absurdity, director lewis john carlino seems to believe a circumstance like this could actually happen. if he's right, that's far more shocking than anything in "sailor". * from ****

1st watched 1/1/2003 - 3 out of 10(dir-henri verneuil): sober drama about a well-to-do doctor who gets into trouble carrying on a relationship with a younger woman, whom his family brings in to live with them, as well as being married to another in the same household. his searching for happiness is not clear, but they do bring out the reason for his unhappiness rather well by displaying the overbearing trait of the females in his wife's line. well played, but predictable drama.

like i'm sure other people have said this guy isn't a very worthwhile subject. sure, our society has a morbid fascination with death, and it's funny hearing him talk about how much he smokes and how much coffee he drinks, but he's into giving himself an unworthy mystique. anyway, the bottom line is that he's a moron racist using feeble methods to try to disprove the mountain of evidence of the holocaust, and as such he should be forgotten by time. but morris is in love with any kind of curiosities, which normally i wouldn't fault him for.

new year 2006, and i'm watching glimmer man again. say what you like, i find steven seagal's movies amusing. like many comments, good fight sequences - i particularly liked his answering of the phone at the restaurant saying how long it would be closed for restoration. bit like schwarzenegger's humour in the earlier action films - although that tended to be self-deprecating.but the one i like here is brian cox. one of the most versatile actors around. pity about his hand and foot, but so much for withstanding extended interrogation - must have flunked that class at the "farm".as the films went on i wonder just how the ever thickening girth of seagal affected his movement?. never mind, it's entertainment!.

two l.a cops track down a serial killer nicknamed "the family man" who has wiped out whole families and when one of the police officer's wife takes the deep six, questions are raised and it turns out that a serial killer isn't responsible but rather mobsters. the idea of seagal in a serial killer movie is an interesting concept, indeed one could see seagal play a good serial killer however making him a cop who has a ridiculous penchant for prayer beads and razor sharp credit cards comes off more stupid than likably ridiculous. also a running joke involves wayon's enjoyment of eating powdered deer penis and well this raunchy material is utterly out of place. not to mention the beginning of a school being taken hostage, due to a boy's breakup with his girlfriend. after seagal neutralizes him, the girlfriend tells the young lad that she loves him. now there is a lesson to be learned from all of this, if you want your girlfriend back, taking the school hostage may get you back on her good side. i myself would think flowers or the old fashioned phone call might work, then again though, i'm old fashioned. besides who am i to put a damper on somebody else's brilliant reconciliation plan.* out of 4-(bad)

my age: 13james cole, played by steven seagal, is sent to help detective jim campbell, played by keenen ivory wayans, solve a series of killings in which the victims are crucified. since cole has arrived on the spot, he notices that the killings have changed a little, and thinks there is a different killer. it becomes personal when his ex-wife is murdered, and campbell finds his fingerprints on the body. campbell investigates the mysterious cole, and finds out about a very shady past.i am not a fan of steven seagal. i enjoy action movies, but he is the worst actor i have ever seen. this film is not much fun to watch at all, incredibly dumb, and, obviously, steven seagal's acting performance is absolutely horrid. keenen ivory wayans isn't too bad, though. the only redeeming thing in this film is the occasional good action scene, although most come round because of insanely stupid reasons. the plot in this film is absolute gibberish. i didn't care for it at all. the whole "glimmer man" past of seagal's character was stupid, all the mafia fights and fights in the restaurant were there for almost no reason. give this film a miss.australian classification: ma 15+: high level violencerating: 35 out of 100 (quite generous)

i can't believe this movie has an average rating of 7.0! it is a fiendishly bad movie, and i saw it when it was fairly new, and i was in the age group that is supposed to like it!

to this day, i have never seen elizabeth shue in anything else because of the stench of this movie. poorly acted, poorly plotted and racially neanderthal, it took place in a chicago where every black person apparently lived in a blues club. . spoiler ahead. . . . . ..spoiler: her "blues" solo was even more painful to watch than her clueless acting and the intro into it - 'nobody leaves without singing the blues' -- was as dumb as a post. the children her character was babysitting were insufferable and well before the movie's end i was wishing for something horrible to happen to all of them.i have to say though, there is one special thing about this movie; it takes a lot for a movie to offend me but this smoldering piece of tripe did what chopper, the phantom menace and catwoman could not -- make me sick to my stomach.

i would not recommend this movie. even though it is rated g and is clearly for kids there is quite a lot of swearing (including the dreaded 'f' and 's' words). this kind of language doesn't offend me particularly but in a kids film? come on.there was also quite a bit of implied sexual content, between one of the early adolescent male characters and any willing adult woman who came along - including a prostitute! the acting was as good as it gets in this genre of film but the story line was very very cheesy and even my four year old remarked that it was 'stupid'.despite having elizabeth shue, this film is definitely not worth checking out if you haven't seen it.

excellent example of the disaster that happens when you combine a challenging script with two actors chosen for physical appeal. it is rare for me to be consciously aware of the acting during the first viewing of a movie because i try to just go with the story and save the analysis for the second viewing. in the case of "full ride", the acting was so weak that the movie was impossible to appreciate as a story; i was too busy (during first and only viewing) alternating between laughter and nausea.fortunately for most individual members of the cast, pretty much everyone in the ensemble is weak, the individual talent limitations do not contrast with any actual competent acting. riley smith and meredith monroe are at least well matched physically, finding common ground in looking far too old for the credible age of their characters.unfortunately the script requires especially intense and convincing performances to portray their characters which just exposes smith and monroe's staggering lack of talent. on the positive side, they know enough to not look directly into the camera and they do not stutter.better to have used a less attractive pair who could physically pass for the proper age. the basic story is not particularly original, just another variation on "an officer and a gentleman", but it would have provided a nice showcase for a talented pair of "teenage" actors.then again, what do i know? i'm just a child.

this is movie is really bad. i like to flip on the tv while napping and this movie looked like it would be something good to sleep through, and boy was i wrong. my body literally woke me up from sleeping and said "hey... this movie is awful... you gotta watch it". i love bad movies with bad actors and stupid plots. something about unintentional comedy gets me going. this movie is impressively crappy. i really don't know how to properly express it aside from recommending you watch it just to see how bad it is. i mean, seriously, you should watch it with people. i was making the best jokes outloud during this movie and no one was there to hear them.worse than swimfan. it's that bad.

last fall (of 2001), i took a film class that was taught by the director of this movie (mark hoeger). his vast knowledge of filmmaking, his ability to dissect any scene of a film, and his winning of an academy award in some obscure category seemed to give him more credibility than your average independent film director. when he mentioned during one of his classes that he had just finished directing a film called "full ride" and was in the post-production stages, my interest was piqued. however, that would be the last i would ever hear of that film project. until last week...last week, i saw in a tv listing that "full ride" was going to be showing on the wb network. this immediately raised a red flag, as i can't help but associate wb with teensploitation shows such as dawson's creek, charmed, etc. plus, the fact that full ride was going to be released straight to tv wasn't too flattering in itself. but, nevertheless, i set aside that time and sat down to watch my former film teacher's creation.after two hours passed and the end credits began to roll, i thought long and hard about what i had just seen. what i had just seen was a typical wb-quality show stretched out to the length of two hours. in fact, it almost seemed as if this movie was made with the sole intent of only showing on the wb network. critiquing this movie will basically be like critiquing a typical wb show.where to begin? the characters are shallow, the story is cliche in every sense of the word, the scenes are completely contrived, and the character development is forced and unbelievable. this movie just screams `unoriginal.'the main character, matt sabo, is some hot shot from the wrong side of the tracks (literally) who plays solid high school football as a fullback, but then fizzles off into a life of crime. he is then offered a chance at a full ride scholarship instead of going to jail. obviously, without much of a choice, he agrees to play football with an all-star football team, but is not excepted among his peers because of his poor team spirit and bad attitude.then comes the love interest. of course! where would this predictable fanfare be without a love interest? she comes in the form of amy lear (played by the beautiful meredith monroe). she is actually a likable character, as opposed to the ever-so-abrasive matt sabo, so we almost applaud her when she rejects him at first. but, of course, the inevitable comes to pass. she falls for him, changes his attitude towards everything, and all seems good and happy. but now it's time for conflict!earlier in the movie, amy makes it clear to matt that she doesn't want to score with him, because it would be `shameful' to her and her mother. this is much to matt's dismay, and his football buddies (yes, they eventually warm up to him) who bet him he wouldn't get any. but, of course, matt eventually comes to accept these terms and decides he's not all about the nookie. here's where the exciting plot thickens. if you don't want me to ruin this surprise, then skip ahead.[begin spoiler]matt finds out from some local guys that apparently amy lear always tries to score with a guy each year from the all-star team so that she can try to use him to escape her small town life of working in a cafeteria (which is baffling in the first place) and make it to the big city. suddenly realizing he's been used and that his love was a sham, matt it tempted to turn back to a life of crime and leave the football camp before `the big game.' amy tries to reassure him that she was really in love this time, but he's too hot-headed to buy it. so what will matt do? will he take her back? or will he go back to robbing gas stations and being an all-round jerk? i won't ruin the super-ultra-surprising ending for you.[end spoiler]so, if i somehow got you pumped up for this movie, please realize that that was my sarcasm and not genuine enthusiasm. this movie is an uninspired version of `varsity blues' or `summer catch.' and that's not saying much. there's hardly any comedy to save it and the characters are too shallow to care about. so what do you have left? not a whole lot.what i most disliked about the movie was how much of an unflattering picture hoeger painted of nebraska through this film. it seems like he was trying to capture the essence of rural nebraska and teenage life in the small towns, but his approach is all too stereotypical and shallow. the characters' high hopes for making in `the big city' and the actions they take to do so are greatly exaggerated, and it only further cements the stereotype of nebraskans being a bunch of hicks living in farm communities. i am unsure of whether or not hoeger's intentions were good in trying to put his home state in the spotlight, but i think he ended up with a very shameful product. if hoeger wanted to portray nebraska in a favorable light, he should have taken a note or two from alexander payne. while payne simply chooses to use nebraska as a backdrop for his films, hoeger integrates it into the plot of full ride and becomes so entangled in his awareness of where he's shooting, that he ends up churning out superficial garbage that would seem to come from an outsider. if hoeger actually lived here, you'd think he'd know better than that.all in all, i am completely disappointed in hoeger's first big film, and i hope that next time he can combine his knowledge with a little bit of originality to create something different and thought-provoking.

if this movie were in production today it would probably have the christian right-wingers screaming 'child porn'. it is far from a great film, in fact it is rather pedestrian. however, if you have an imagination and a fond remembrance of youth and first love i recommend it.

if movies where virtual reality characters come to life and they are all either male tough guys or female eye candy sounds good to you, then perhaps this movie may not be a total waste of film. needless to say, the overwhelming majority of people will find this to be an absolute bore, with little acting talent, and even less of a script. yes, athena massey is nice to look at, but that is the only positive thing that i can say about this disaster.

why is it that virtual "x-rated video game" women can speak through their mouths but virtual fighting game champion dante has to use a combination of telepathy and over dramatic facial expressions? i feel that either they needed to cast someone who looked more villain-like (michael bermardo's big brown doe eyes don't exactly strike fear in the hearts of well.. anyone except for maybe casting directors who consistently cast him as either a villain or a heroic 'bad boy'.) or they needed to just let him use his real voice (and move his mouth), and maybe give him a costume that would not make him stick out like a sore thumb when walking down the street. (but of course this is the future and we must assume that bad fashion taste is considered the norm.)

i actually liked this movie. sure, the acting was flat, there was no plot, and the villain was the lamest that i've seen. michael bernardo as dante is worth laughs in his own right, with an incredibly funny catchphrase and evil laugh. but its worth seeing, just for the worst explosion you will ever see outside of the power rangers tv series. you'll know it when you see it. honestly, this movie must have the budget of a low grade porno. i almost stopped watching after an hour, but i recommend watching through the whole thing; at the very least, there's plenty of eye candy for all to enjoy. recommended for viewers with a high tolerance to poor movies.

everybody loves to see a really bad movie sometime. you watch it, take a good laughs and forget it in the next half hour. but this is not one of those. it's the worst thing that will appear in front of your eyes for a while.i would like to see someone to take responsibility for dante - he's really the most stupid villain you can think of: a guy in leather pants that speaks with a voice over and has a victory laugh like a 50's dracula. how can someone came up with this guy?? and the hero..."the dragon" or whatever...my cereals box has better acting skills than him (maybe than all of them), it's unbelievable. but the worst are the fighting scenes where you would think there could be something in it. they're so lame, it's beyond any kind of description. there's no shame, i just can't believe how this movie was allowed by any studio. but i'm just thrilled it was. watching this is a self-mutilating pleasure. see this only if you're in a movie quest for pain, and in that case, this one is a sure winner.

so pathetic its not even funny. from the first scene in the movie i knew i was in for a bad time. thank goodness i only saw this movie on tv. the story line was terrible, not to mention the acting. it was horrid. very unreal and unusual things happened in this move such as. the lady sticks a whip under the door and whips the guy a little and he just hands over the keys. i'm like, get real. the creators lousy attempt to make a futuristic city even deepened my dislike for the film. to tell you the truth the only good thing in this movie at all was the fighting, which was in itself pretty lame. all i could ask myself when watching this movie was "when is it gonna go off!"

this harold lloyd short wasn't really much; not one of his funnier efforts. of course, i never see bratty kids as anything hilarious. that's what the bulk of this story is, harold and his wife, mildred davis, babysitting his in-laws two young kids. one is a baby who is constantly crying and the other is a four-year-old terror who does everything but demolish the house. letting the kid create havoc over and over was not entertaining to me.the best part was the last four or five minutes when the couple thinks that this big goon (noah young) is burglarizing their house. half the time it's the pet cat scaring the couple, but overall, that segment is fun with some good sight gags, reminding me of another lloyd short, "haunted spooks."however, the good ending doesn't save the whole picture, which i probably wouldn't watch again. lloyd has done too many other good things to waste even 25 minutes on this one again. it just isn't that funny.

the film listed here as having been made in 1980 is not the film which is available from something weird video in their "driver's ed scare films vol. 5". for one thing the 1980 version is in color. swv has on this disc an earlier version (1972) of the film made in b&w for wlwt television channel 5 in cincinnati. either way this film is notorious. however, unlike most other driver's ed films, this was intended for television broadcast and viewing by the general public. thus the level of carnage has been ratcheted down. it's still a pretty grim exercise in exploitation of bloody death for a purported educational intent. i live in the cincinnati area and i remember this thing being shown every year around prom time on channel 5. if you're looking for one film that demonstrates the tone of this uniquely american film phenomenon, "the last prom" is pretty typical - morose, hyperbolic, extremely didactic, heavy on melodrama. whether it really affected any teenager's driving at all is anyone's guess.

oh my... bad clothing, worse synth music and the worst: david hasselhoff. the 80's are back with vengeance in witchery, an american-italian co-production, helmed by infamous joe 'd'amato on the production side and short-careered director (thank heavens for small miracles) fabrizio laurenti directing . marketed as a kind of sequel to sam raimi's evil dead series in italy (that was dubbed "la casa" in there), witchery delivers some modest gore groceries and bad acting.a mix of ghost story, possessions and witchcraft, the film bounces clueless from scene to another without letting some seriously wooden actors and hilarious day and night mix-ups slow it's progress to expectable ending, topped with some serious wtf surprise climax. (i just love the look on her face...) surprisingly laurenti manages to gather some suspense and air of malice in few - very few - scenes; unluckily for him, these few glimpses of mild movie magic go down quickly and effectively.the plus sides are experienced, when the gore hits the fan. this department is quite effective and entertaining in that classic latex and red paint style of the 80's italo-gore, when things were made 100% hand-made and as shockingly and vivid as modest budgets could allow. i could only watch with sadistic glee and few laughters all the over-the-top ways that obnoxious characters (and actors) got mangled and misused, one by one. i only felt sorry for linda blair, who apparently haven't been let to try any other than that good old possessed girl / woman role ever in his career, or so it looks like when checking out his filmography.well, folks - not much more to tell, and even less to tell home about. don't expect too much when spending some rainy afternoon with this, and probably you'll experience at least some mild fun. it also helps if your rotten little heart pounds in the beat of 80's euro gore horror. and speaking of hearts - every movie that has david hasselhoff getting skewered by a sizeable metal object and bleeding heavily around the room and corridors, must have it's one on the right place.this is my truth - what is yours?

i hated the first movie is really boring and we only get see the octopus at the end. the plot dead bodies are being found in the new york harbor. the police have no clues nor suspects until nick and his colleague realize the killer is a giant octopus. everybody, especially the police captain, refuses to believe nick's story, and soon the harbor will be filled with boats for the 4th of july celebrations...in this movie we get to see more of the giant octopus and special effects for this movie are really good for it's time.the acting is this movie not bad but not great too but okay and watch able. the are some really cheese scenes to movie but if can get past that, you should enjoy the rest of movie. 5/10

when i saw the first octopus movie it was a laugh see the cheesy acting and appalling effects. this film seemed to make up for the acting, but not the special effects. after jaws and piranha, sure, why not make a film about a killer octopus? the octopus invades the new york waters, where 2 police investigators try stopping the rampaging beast before the 4th of july.a pretty clean plot and descent happenings but the octopus was pretty much appalling, its nice to see they actually made it this time but it looked like a piece of plastic... better on a big budget really, this film could have been a good watch. there's a continuous amount of errors where it wouldn't surprise me if they didn't research the way octopus live...watch this if you like cheap dvd sequels, otherwise your better watching jaws.

during the summer, the cue line for this attraction is really long, since it is a water ride. it's very well-themed, but a lot of the ride's artifacts seem to be out of order. overall, the ride is not worth it if you have to wait for almost 2 hrs. in line. the drop at the end is exciting, but the whole ride itself could have been better. creators for indiana jones could have prob. helped these hollywood designers. also, many times the ride breaks down and causes even longer waiting periods for others. it's also very unpleasing when they only have one raft departing dock open and not the two, like they are supposed to. during halloween horror nights, you ride in the dark, and it's exciting if it's your first time, but if it's not, then don't bother waiting in a four-hour line.

the salena incident is by far the director, dustin rikert's, best film --- which isn't saying much. in his past films (and i use the term "films" loosely), the director takes ideas from hollywood blockbusters and severely marginalizes them. the salena incident is no different. the movie is basically con air meets aliens done with the semblance of your average film school production. the film is riddled with out-of-focus shots and plagued by special effects that would have trouble rivaling most high school computer animation classes. for example almost every on-screen explosion is the same fire effect matted over the screen.the weak effects and production value are only compromised by a flawed plot and rocky dialogue. in a sentence, the story strings together like an exposition of overused hollywood clichés. the movie begins with the worst cgi alien ship ever made crashing into the worst cgi earth ever made and a team of army somethings going down to investigate. next a bus of prison transports, carrying the worst of the worst from across the state, is overthrown by the prisoners with the help of their blonde girlfriends armed with silicon implants. the prisoners escape and run into the town of salena where they encounter the aliens who... shock... have escaped from an alien prison transport carrying the worst of the worst from across the galaxy. the prisoners, and their captive police armed with only guns and sad puns have to fight off the aliens and escape the town before the international space alliance *rolls eyes* bombs the city into oblivion.the only real enjoyable parts of the movie are when the actors (who are clearly undermined by the script) are given the freedom to improvise and also when they fight off the smaller of the alien creatures in a flurry of gun fire. other than that, the movie really isn't worth anyone's time let alone the plastic that the dvd is made out of. how awful was it? let's just say the secretary of defense is about 90 years old, works in a room that is about as high tech 1950's real estate office and is wearing a looney tunes tie. yes, if that wasn't clear enough before, the man in charge of the pentagon is wearing a tie with bugs bunny and the road runner on it. the movie basically culminates (hahahahhaaa did i say culminates...) with the last remaining soldier running into the group of prisoners and guards and the new formed team fighting their way away from the vicious aliens --- which for some strange reason leads them straight back to the alien ship? yeah...the movie has heart but is riddled with horrible direction and even worse camera work. someone seriously needed to slap the dp and tell him there is more to cinematography than repetitive, stagnant, chest-level shots. this movie really isn't worth renting (if it ever makes it that far) being that it's not as horribly bad as the last films made by the director which reduces the laugh-ability, but it's nowhere near watchable cinema.

i have never really been interested in cannibal movies before and up until a couple of months ago i had avoided this genre of movie.i recently had to undergo knee surgery and found i had a lot of time on my hands as i was unable to work, so i decided after seeing almost every horror movie our local video shop had to offer i would take a chance on this.christ was it a mistake! i have never seen a movie this bad in all my years of being a movie addict. this is just a pile of s**t pasted to a d.v.d disc and sold as a horror movie.i have a lot of respect to other horror fans who can switch their brains off long enough to enjoy this crap, they are more brain dead than i ever will be and that is some achievement! 0/10 and thats generous.

the hills have eyes is not a great film by any stretch of the imagination.for one the villains look almost normal,not what you would expect deranged lunatics to look like.for another the pacing is very slow at times and there are many scenes of the characters repeating themselves.by that,i mean there is a lot of filler in the movie, with a lot of running around aimlessly.the film didn't have a clear direction.the plot of the movie is hardly original,even for its time.the texas chainsaw massacre came out a few year earlier and is a much more effective film, as far as horror goes.the film has little in the way of scares, and the pounding soundtrack just served to be both grating and distracting all at once.i suppose the music was used to cover up the fact that not much happens through much of the movie, though it failed in its intended purpose.i basically kept looking at the time every few seconds hoping something would happen or it would end .when something finally did happen any promise the film had was ruined by mere chaos and loud noise.i sat through it because i like to give a film the benefit of the doubt.yes, there is some loud screaming,and yes people die,but who cares.much too slow getting to any sort of pay off,if you can call it that.my buddy enjoyed it, so at least one of us got something out of it.the hills have eyes isn't the worst film we could have watched, but i doubt i will watch it again.this film was remade in 2006 and i will also have review of that version.anyway, this movie was painfully slow at times, while other times was chaotic and repetitive.unless you like watching paint dry, occasionally interspersed with someone running around your block, screaming their head off, stay away from this movie.a better bet would be the original texas chainsaw massacre(1973)1.5* out of 10* which is being generous

tagline: the lucky ones died...before watching this.i've never watched a bulgarian movie from 1920's, so i can't say this is the worst movie ever made, but it surely is the worst movie i've ever watched. i can't almost remember it.all i can recall is a family of stupid people who don't do anything right. their car has one wheel out of four stuck in the sand, so they decide that there's nothing to do and prepare to live the rest of their lives there. then there's an old man who is aware of the existence of a band of cannibals in the whereabouts but has never considered the idea to report the fact to the police.and, speaking of the police...if those freaks have lived around there eating humans for years, lots of people must have disappeared...how come the sheriff didn't suspect anything?but i gave up asking questions after the first five minutes or so. the rest is bore. an hallucinated unbelievable bore.i will be merciful and won't speak about the dialogues. and the acting. and the effects.i will only mention the final scene, where the freak girl eliminates a snake (the snakes! they come out in the end, what the hell do they have to do with the story?) with a sniper-precise throw of a stone, demonstrating the full disregard of mr. craven for reality and for things that happen on planet earth in general.i believe there have been riots when the film was first released in 1977.even being eaten by a cannibal wouldn't be a fair punishment to the director for this attack on intelligence.

this movie was recommended to me by several people, and after reading all the positive comments from this site i went ahead and bought a copy of the film off ebay. the acting in the film is average and a bit hammy, especially by the family of cannibals, one sequence comes to mind when jupiter is ranting and raving to the burnt corpse, speaking right into the camera. its one of those performances where you just cringe and feel bad for that poor actor. its also evidence of some of the worst editing i've seen, theres a terrible jump cut right in the middle of his "speech". there are a few creepy moments though, and at times the music works well...but overall the film isnt that great and i dont know why people think wes craven is that great of a director. thus far he hasn't showed me anything that i believe to be brilliant, the only thing that improved with cravens films, production to prodution was his budget.

infamous horror films seldom measure up the hype that surrounds them and i have yet to come across a worse offender than wes craven's the hills have eyes. having held back from watching this for years, i was really pleased when i got it for christmas and waited for an evening when my girlfriend was out to settle down and watch it - knowing her extreme dislike for anything genuinely horrifying. i needn't have bothered.after a promising - if familiar - start, that firmly sets the film in the 'desolution usa' world of survival horror, things rapidly go to pieces when the protagonists and antagonists meet in the deserted wasteland.looking like it was shot on a budget of $5, with the cannibal clan's costumes hired from a dodgy fancy dress shop that specialises in faux caveman and red indian attire, the story follows an annoying bunch of unsympathetic wasps who take a detour on a road trip to california, to look for a silver mine in a nuclear testing zone (!). when they break down they are set upon by the local family of flesh-eaters and have to fight to survive.while hoping for another deliverance, texas chainsaw massacre, wrong turn or devil's rejects, i actually realised i'd stumbled across something that should have remained dusty and unwatched in a backstreet video store's bargain bin.with gallons of tomato ketchup for blood and a couple of gruesome wound close-ups, i can kind of see how an 18 certificate (in the uk) is justified, but with those close-ups trimmed this wouldn't have looked out of place as a saturday afternoon thriller on itv.the whole silver mine/nuclear test site subplot is just a mcguffin to justify pitching the 'civilised' family against the primitives, but given how easily the savages get their asses whupped it stretches credibility to think that they had survived for a generation preying on passers-by.and then there's the ending ... or lack thereof. the hills have eyes seems to be missing either a third act or, at the very least, a satisfying denouement. instead, i was just left wondering: "yeah, and ... ?"

i really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie. i don't think i've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-indulgent piece of junk. it probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really isn't that noteworthy. another thing i didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face, a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after. i don't know how folks bleed over there in japan, but i hope they have plenty of blood donors.

so, it has come to this. in the top-rated comment on this flick, somebody says "nishi is an honorable man". really? this is a guy who mainly kills and maims people in the movie. he takes a short break to rob a bank. honorable? how would you like your kids to go to school with the kids of someone who calls that honorable? wait, there's more! the person also says "we can tell he's constantly thinking." how can we do that? well, do you know that joke "how can you tell when a ceo/politician/lawyer is lying?" ... "his/her lips move." well, nishi's lips never move, so i guess that means he is thinking.of course, this is existentialism to warm the hearts of the cult of victimization. existentalism supposedly stresses that an individual take responsibility for the consequences of one's acts. not nishi. borrow money from the yakuza. what, they want it back? kill them. the cops find out. kill yourself and your wife.really honorable.

hana-bi has many quiet moments and fairly slow pacing. unfortunately, during the many thoughtful interludes the viewer is left to ponder about the recent scenes just watched and many questions surface and annoy.for example, why didn't the wheelchair guy drown in the ocean when he was stuck in the sand and the tide came up around him? there was no rescue seen or hinted at.can it be true that japanese police are so inept and unskilled at arrest procedures as to not first remove the suspect's ability to reach for a weapon? these detective-level japanese police seemed to have no experience dealing with a suspect.why doesn't the right eye of the lead character blink? having one eye blinking was distracting and it went unexplained.what exactly was the lead character spending all his money on to have to borrow so much from loan sharks? he was not seen gambling. being a non entry-level government employee his wife must have had full health insurance.what was the single man doing all by himself in the middle of nowhere in the nature park? what was his reason for being there?how in the world could the gangsters find the lead character and his wife up in the far off nature reserve? it made no sense.and again, how could the gangsters later find the lead character and his wife up in the remote mt. fuji resort? there were absolutely no clues available for these gangsters to even know which country the lead character and his wife were in, let alone the correct specific location at the correct specific time!and a third same question, how could the junior detectives know which few feet of the japanese coast line to find the lead character and his wife? the japanese coast line must be vast. were all of these characters supposed to have psychic powers?two final questions: the cute girl trying to fly a kite on the beach -- where did she come from? she seemed to have no transportation or companions with her. and why in the world did she still keep attempting to fly what was left of her kite after it was ripped in pieces?! this was weird. unintentionally python-esque.on the positive side, i loved the background music. it was dramatic and flowing and added much to this movie. the photography, imagery and art were pleasing to the eye.one final point, the wife was overly pleasing to the eye. not once did she ever come close to looking like a dying sick person. she looked very healthy. if anything, these people seemed depressed and mentally ill and not physically sick. the husband treated his wife as perhaps a newly outed gay man would treat a respected wife... a love of friendship, but not close tenderness.a mixed movie for sure.

the only reason this show did not get a 0 is because one is not available. this show has gone from informative news to sensationalized claptrap. i tried to support this show in its decline, because i like human interest stories and primetime used to have some very good ones. unfortunately, april 21st has forever changed my mind about this show and the unethical newscasters that participate in it. abc actually recorded a brutal case of child abuse and then refused to show it until the statute of limitations had run out and the parents could not be arrested on the charges they should have faced. what made it worse was how abc swept the whole incident under the rug; instead of taking charge and seeking true professional help for these disturbed individuals, they had some pop psychologists send stern warnings to the audience about how they shouldn't judge these poor angels too harshly. i was truly sickened. i hope this review stops one person from watching this investigative trash in the future. if it does, i will be happy. these days, all you can expect from diane sawyer and the good folks from primetime live are butt-kissing sessions with a-list celebrities and criminal acts covered up and praised to the stars. don't waste the hour of your life; you'd be better off watching an old sitcom on nick at nite.

i'm sorry to say this but i didn't enjoy this movie at all. it was just too boring. so boring that i couldn't watch the rest of it. it's not as interesting as the lion king or aladdin. that's why i hate this stupid days because these days are just not what they used to be. the movies that disney have released lately really sucks! i miss the old days when they used to produce good movies like the lion king, aladdin, pocahontas, cinderella, the aristocats, and robin hood. this movie is really awful. i really tried my best to be interested in this movie but i just couldn't. i don't think i could recommend this film to anyone. i would recommend the ones that i just mention above.

hi there. i watched the first part when it came out, and i don't remember having left such a bad impression on me as this one.first, the animation is choppy, wooden, not worked on, lacks naturality - i understand the drawing style was to be of some 'atlantean' kind, but, it could be done with the usual disney finesse... see "tarzan" to see what i mean. if i didn't see the disney logo in the beginning, i would never say it was a disney movie.second, the plot was more like a pc game style, like a good old quest. not that it was bad, but it lacked a story that binds the viewer to the characters and their goals. it was inconvincing, at least. the film was meant for children, but this was waaay to childish at times.third, the music... i would say it was improper, but it just fits the whole scene with the plot and animation...overall, i think this was some kind of an amusement, just by-the-way kind of project by several apprentice animators, just to fill in the count for disney movies. sorry to hear that from myself, a big disney lover...

i am finding that i get less and less excited about disney's sequels to movies. yes, i do understand that the budget for the direct to video movies are not the same, but these movies don't even try. some examples are hunchback ii and tarzan and jane. if anyone has seen the previews for stitch-the movie, you will see my point. but i digress, this movie reaffirms my point. the animation is sloppy, the story lines resemble saturday morning cartoons, and not all of the original voices are there. i was very disappointed not to hear michael j. fox's voice. it was so glaringly obvious that the person doing milo's voice was trying to sound like fox, but didn't come close to succeeding. if it says anything, my children ages 10 and 6 didn't even sit through the whole movie.

my main criticism with the movie is the animation. i totally agree with everyone else it was very poor. some of the characters seemed to have darker skin tones than they did in the first film, which is much better. also the background colours looked rushed and somewhat static. it is also a shame that michael j.fox didn't voice milo, he did such a good job, and james arnold taylor wasn't sure whether he was supposed to sound like milo or aladdin. i have also taken into consideration the lack of a good storyline. the third story was confusing and clumsily told, and the second story suffered from poor scripting. to make things worse, the first one i can't even remember, other than a fishing village being haunted or something like that. however, there was some nice music, and good voice talents from john mahoney, cree summer, clancy brown and tom wilson, that saved the film from total disaster. all in all, a disappointing sequel to a surprisingly good film. 4/10 bethany cox.

this movie was horrible, and it doesn't even deserve to be called a movie. the way i look at it, it's more like three mediocre day-time disney cartoon episodes strung loosely together to make a single video that pretends to be the sequel to the first atlantis movie, which was way more well-made and enjoyable. and where do i even begin with the problems of this dvd? the story? the characters? the pictures/animation? to me they're all bad and unwatchable. firstly, the story in this direct-to-video dvd is ridiculous and pointless. the only good thing about it is that it is consistent--that is, consistently bad, from the beginning to the end. after the film's over i still don't know why milo has returned and how the incidents occur in the three small stories are related to each other or to atlantis itself. and all i could remember about this movie was how bad it makes me feel after seeing it. the characters feel wooden and lack personality, and the drawings look a lot different than that in the first. you can tell they're obviously not from the hands of the same animators from the first one. as the dvd played on, i found myself caring less and less about what might happen to the characters and just hoping the film would end soon. besides the story and the characters mentioned above, the picture quality is poor in this one too, probably one of the worst in those direct-to-video products that disney has ever released. as a fan of the the original atlantis: the lost empire, i couldn't be more disappointed in milo's return, which is a total waste of time and money. thank goodness i rented it first instead of buying it. even so, i still wish i'd never seen this crap or even known its existence.

looking for a movie for your turkey film festival? the roller blade seven is on my list of the ten worst films of all-time. the plot, the story of a post-apocalyptic roller blading samurai warrior, is a convoluted hodge-podge of film references of everything from star wars to the seven samauri. the acting fluctuates from bland to abysmal. the scene where the villain tempts the old master is embarrassing to the point of jeering laughter. frank stalone's black knight reminds one too much of john cleese's black knight in monty python and the holy grail. (word of advice, frank: when you stoop to doing a movie like this one, your career is over.) i chanced upon this little stink-bomb on a low-end cable channel and i could not stop watching. it is like watching a train wreck, you just can't look away.

this film is, far and wide and beyond any shadow of a doubt, the single worst and most contemptible film in the history of the universe.it really *is* that bad.personally i have always enjoyed the guilty pleasure of a terrible film, and rented this one thinking it would be one of those. to my immense disappointment, it was not.the script is delivered in a way that sounds as if they're reading the lines directly off placards, the story makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, and the actual film looks like it was shot on a home video camera. i couldn't even finish watching it. it is even worse than "witch academy", and that's quite a feat in itself.i cannot even begin to fathom how a director could shoot this film, and then still have the sense to believe it was decent enough to release.painful, awful, horrendous.

my house mate and i foolishly purchased the video of 'the roller blade seven' from our local second hand video shop in the hope of finding a bad film to laugh at. this film isn't even laughable, it's pathetically poor, worse even than jack frost 2-and that's saying something. the script, acting, production, stunts, sound, sets, everything is absolutely terrible. in some parts the actors haven't even learned their lines and are blatantly ad-libbing or in one case actually having the lines read to them off set and simply repeating them. set in the post apocalyptic 'wheel zone',the film obviously consists of about 45 minutes of film, many parts of which are edited badly or repeated ad nauseum from various different camera angles to make the film longer. this gets tedious very quickly. the plot makes no sense whatsoever (it is apparently an amalgam of two books written by scott shaw), there aren't even seven of them, most of them aren't on blades, they're wearing roller boots, and it seems to me that mostly the film has been completely sold on the fact that there's about 3 minutes of female semi-nudity in it. the writer and star scott shaw obviously fancies himself somewhat of a samurai and throughout the film performs some very poor stunts and made up sword fighting moves that look massively amateurish. despite all this, his website states that the film should never be compared to a traditional film because it really pushes the boundaries of modern film making. my house mate and i were left speechless by the whole ordeal, and despite my frequent attempts to burn the videotape, she has decided it may be some kind of ring-esquire video curse that needs to be passed on. if you see the video in stores, take it from me! leave well alone!

an italian/american co-production co-starring linda blair and david 'the hoff' hasselhoff: how could any fan of trashy horror resist such a treat?well, based on the uneventful, extremely tedious, and utterly nonsensical first forty minutes or so, i would have said 'very easily'; thankfully, however, things do eventually get a tad more entertaining with the introduction of several inventive death scenes, and for those lucky enough to find an uncut copy, a smattering of nudity too (unfortunately, my copy was optically edited to remove such offensive material).the hoff stars as gary, a photographer who accompanies his beautiful girlfriend leslie (leslie cumming) to a run-down hotel on a seemingly deserted island in order to take pictures for her latest project, a book about witches; whilst there, frustrated gary also hopes to try and cure a bad case of blue balls by relieving leslie of her virginity.his plans for nookie are scuppered, however, by the unexpected arrival of property developers freddie and rose brooks (robert champagne and annie ross), their pregnant daughter jane (blair), son tommy (michael manchester), pretty nymphomaniac architect linda sullivan (catherine hickland), and estate agent jerry (rick farnsworth), who have come to inspect the island's hotel.after explaining their unexpected presence on the island, gary and leslie are welcomed by the property's new owners, and when a violent storm suddenly picks up, making it perilous to return to the mainland, everyone agrees to spend the night in the old building. unfortunately, unbeknownst to the hotel's new guests, the place is also home to the spirit of an evil witch (hildegard knef), who requires human sacrifices in order to bring herself back to life. one by one, victims are pulled into a swirling red vortex (which is guaranteed to provide unintentional laughs), before meeting a terrible fate.none of this makes much sense, and the acting is atrocious (manchester as tommy is particularly bad, whilst hasselhoff proves to be one of the better performers, which speaks volumes about the others), but those viewers who make it past the dreary first half are rewarded with some pretty decent moments of gore: rose has her lips sewn together, before being roasted alive in a fireplace; jerry is crucified and burnt alive; linda is tortured by hags and impaled on a swordfish(!!); freddie's veins pulsate and erupt in geysers of blood; and gary gets stabbed in the back.oh, and leslie is raped by a guy with no lips and blair gets possessed (again).

a post-apocalyptic warrior goes off to save some kind of nun and on the way meets some cyber-punks on skates who want to kick his ass. this is one of the hardest to watch films ever, there are scenes with silence that seems to last hours before somebody comes out with the next badly written, badly acted line. there are action sequences that keep repeating - and we're not talking the quickfire 1-2-3 action repeat on a particularly good kick that was made popular by eastern directors, we're talking many, many repeats of long, bad fight sequences. this is incredibly confusing at first but then quickly becomes annoying as you're watching a 30 second sequence for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th time. any kind of plot or vision is lost within the confusing continuity, the only thing thats keeps this film in the videoplayer (apart from the bet from a friend that i couldn't watch it all the way through without begging for it to be turned off and disposed off safely so it may harm no-one else) is the fact that although painful, this film is unintentionally hilarious, i'm not at all a fan of those "so bad that it's funny" type of films but at parts i was in tears. other points to note are the quality of the sound and picture but this is forgiveable as it's obvious money was a major problem in the making of this film. final verdict - king of the "so bad they're funny" genre, anybody having that kind of genre video night should get themselves a copy. also lets not forget that it is actually the worst film i've ever seen.

i knew that i was not about to see a quality film when this title was included in a 'b-grade video night' at a friends place. despite the warnings, i was still surprised at just how bad this film was. it was fortunate that there were a lot of us there to share the pain with each other... the film attempts to tell the story of a dark future, one in which hawk (a mad max type of character) heads off to rescue a damsel in distress. in reality, the plot is a thinly disguised excuse for the producers to promote their own philosophies on life (watch the end credits and the 'these people are not real' disclaimer at the end for a real laugh). the movie is frequently lacking direction, and fails to develop its characters to any degree whatsoever. what's even worse though is the editing of this film. the film repeats scenes (often 10 to 20 seconds long) up to 4 or 5 times in a row. i think that this was an attempt to emulate things like jean claude van-damme fight sequences, but if it is it fails utterly. the film would probably be about 1/3 of its length if we weren't forced to watch the main character move his head in front of the setting sun half a dozen times (yes, that's all that happens in that repeated scene). i give this movie my 'worst film i've ever seen' award. i doubt that it will be topped any time soon.

i bought this movie from a market stall three years ago.. i gotta hand it to you when i sat down and watched it.. i thought 'ok! this is gonna be another big action b-movie..' obviously i was wrong.. while watching this film.. i began to realise that this movie was taking me to another planet.. full of cr*p!i began to get really bored and fed up with this film.. although i wanted to see was gonna happen in the end.. i really felt like it was really getting on my nerves..the people behind the film may've brought some well known name actors into this project.. but what were they thinking..? even these actors couldn't save this film..at the end of the film.. i felt like this was a waste of money.. just buying this low life sucker of film for a small amount of money. a few months later, i sent the tape off to charity.. i didn't want to see it again..sorry! but if you're thinking of watching a movie and then nodding off to sleep.. i can highly recommend it you.. me? i'll rather go on pro-plus and watch something decent..!disappointing 1 out of 10!

for many years ed wood's classic 'plan 9' has been considered the worst film ever made. forget it the roller blade seven is infinitely worse. the cast is made up of famous peoples brothers and almost famous or has been actors and actresses. the plot along with the budget and script are non-existent. the running time is made up not in the classic ed wood style of using stock footage. instead there is endless slow motion and repeated action. and as for the roller blade seven aren't even seven of them!you must see this film just to know how bad film making can really be. giving independent film makers everywhere hope.

this has to be the greatest practical joke ever. i'm amazed that all the other actors kept a straight face. i might be wrong but the impression i get from this movie was that they duped frank stallone and joe estevez into acting in this movie that has a budget of just under $40, depending on how much those nerf bats and spray painted catcher's equipment cost, create the most incoherent movie ever created, and sit back and laugh at the fact that joe estevez and frank stallone weren't in on the joke. if by some chance they weren't kidding and they legitimately tried to make a real movie then i feel sorry for everyone involved in the creation. i've had quite a love affair with cheesy movies, but this movie is so bad i can hardly watch it. they repeat pointless "special effects" so many times that it's obvious they were just trying to cover up the fact that they only shot 30 minutes of footage. if i were forced to watch this movie on repeat i would bludgeon myself unconscious with my own hands after about one and a half times through. no offense to the great frank stallone, but i would rather watch sylvester teach a fingerpainting class for 10 hours than watch that movie ever again.

okay, let's cut to the chase - there's no way i can give this anything other then 1 out of 10; and yet you have to see it! the acting is bad, but is nothing like as bad as the script, which itself pales before the production values. cardboard axes? yup, we've got then. car floor mats painted silver and used as armour? here it is!the film itself pretends to be artistic, but is just cheap; the same shots are used repeatedly - especially in the drawn out fight scenes; there is (thankfully!) very little dialogue, and there is much 'artistic' music to ram home the horror!and yet all this awfulness is compelling - you have to watch it through just so that you can say you've seen it. i've not even got onto the barren sets, the 'plot', or the risible special effects; this really is the 'how not to do it' school of filmmaking. this must be viewed - spread the word, and let the world all join together in puzzling over what on earth is happening at the endthe best thing, though, is that they made a sequel.

it was (foolishly) with some degree of relish that i sat down to watch what a friend had promised would be the worst/best movie experience of my life, the mighty 'roller blade 7'. 2 years on and i'm still in therapy. oh yes my dear friends it really is that bad. they obviously got about 40 minutes of footage in the can and then decided to use said footage endlessly and repeatedly to brain-numbing effect. my only fear of the kind of post-apocalyptic world featured in this turkey is that somehow, some way, a print of this abomination would survive. truly the living would envy the dead.

truly a great leap forward in the perfection of painful cinema.everything about this film is bad. acting (if it can be called that), lighting, sound, script (if there was one), editing, direction, camera work, it is all atrocious. there is not a single element that is done well. if i thought that this was intentional then i might give the film some credit but i can not believe people would set out to make such a horendous film.this film is worth buying and screening to your worst enemies.

in reality that happened: the royal mother in law and father in law lunched with the couple the day after the wedding and gave her the money in public. this troubled young elisabeth so much that she never forgot the issue. we must remember she was only 16. she was so embarrassed that she kept a fear for sex all her life. perhaps this began to appear as a trauma. also the constant meddling of her aunt and mother in law. as you say, she kept all her children away from her, critiqued her teeth and manners (which she considered inappropriate for an empress), and when sissi finally went to venice with her husband and children, her eldest daughter died, and the mother in law blamed her for that unfortunate and premature death. she never recovered.

the figure of empress elizabeth of austria (1837-1898) is, indeed, mostly associated with romy schneider and the sissi trilogy by ernst marischka (1950s) where beauty, gentleness, sweetness but also history are ever present. this was the sissi, perhaps myth for some; however, a powerful portrayal. the spirit of the habsburgs' grandeur as well as the spirit of the bavarian simplicity and straightforwardness influenced much those films. simply, they did have a soul. however, jean daniel verhaeghe's film, though made 50 years later, appears to be a wrong depiction of the empress and her life. it seems to be an attempt to show something different, to reveal some realism as a cure to sweetness; yet, it does not occur to add a lot but rather deprives the whole story of much. let me analyze that in more details.september 1898, sissi embarks at the port of geneva. accompanied by her court maid, she goes to visit dr mayer (didier bezace) whom she is going to tell the whole life story in order to find herself in this tragic life. the action consists of flashbacks to important moments in sissi's life, yet these moments are chaotically presented and, therefore, someone not very knowledgeable of austrian history may get totally misled or confused. much attention is drawn on sissi's bad marriage with the emperor franz josef. the scene of her wedding night is a failure. no one treated an empress like that (i mean undressing and payment). the focus on sissi being misunderstood is right historically, however, the points that her views differ from the rest of the courtiers' are not the true ones. where is her desire for peace? where is her love to her nation? where is her charity? sissi appears to be rather very elegant, modern, liberal (from the 21st century's point of view). she foremost cares for her looks which is not true historically. sissi had an inner life which is not showed in the film. "once women will wear trousers" is a sentence said by her and occurs to be the image of the sissi presented in the movie. sissi detests monarchy, which is the film's noticeable criticism towards austrian empire. moreover, she partly accepts anarchist movements and, to my very surprise, she blames her husband, emperor franz josef, for the death of rudolph, their son. where is any mention in history that sissi was present in mayerling? sissi's relation with sophie, the mother in law, is better shown, however the scene of sophie's death seems barely authentic and the conversation a bit of cliché.sorry to criticize so much but another crucial aspect of the movie which i find weak here are performances. although arielle dombasle has her moments as sissi, she generally does not suit to the role. she looks more like a "femme fa tale" than a tragic empress. her make up is seriously inaccurate as well as most of her gestures as the empress. malik zidi is a bit better as rudolph and may be regarded as the one raising the value of the performances, in general. yet, stephane audran does no special job as sophie: you simply don't get the impression of why she detests sissi. she did despise her for the sake of sissi's young age while crowned, for the sake of her behavior, lifestyle and her believes. partly it appears in the movie but definitely that is not enough. but the greatest mistake is, i think, julien hans capua as andrassi. andrassi was a count with pride, honor, patriotism...here, he appears to be a sort of libertine thinking only to make love to his queen. and the portrayal is so weak that this performance is very very pale. the accurate choice is tatyana ivanova as catherine schratt, she really fits to the role with her looks and her gestures. but, unfortunately, her role does not require much time on screen.a good point of this movie are some costumes and pretty authentic locations. the port of geneva is well presented and the moment of sissi's death occurs to be a good surprise from the movie. it does not appear to be how it really was; however, the moment is good from the symbolical perspective...the empress walks and knows nothing that this is her final moment. that is how she must have felt about it, that is how one insane man destroyed a part of greatness of the world. another good moment visually was when sissi talks to her son rudolph on corfu. but these moments are rare.in sum, it's not a good film. it distorts a very eminent historical figure, a significant historical time, it tries to cure the sweetness of sissi trilogy but appears to offer nothing creative. charm is gone, grandeur is gone and history is ignored! not very worth seeking out! 3/10

this was a movie that could have been great if there were not so many unnecessary historical inaccuracies and if the actors had been chosen or made up to look a little more like the real persons (not very difficult). sissi did not go to mayerling to see her dead son, she also did not die in the street; they carried her on to the boat and then back to the hotel, which was much more dramatic. i am not sure about the wedding night, but i find it exaggerated that a lady-in-waiting would undress the empress and leave her completely naked (and that in the 1850's) or that the emperor would announce very proudly "yes i finally laid her" to the assembled court. as far as i know this was done right away on the first night and nobody rewarded her as if she were a streetwalker. the saving grace of the movie is really stephane audran, excellent actress and true to character.

this film was bad. i believe elton (or is it mike) wong starred in it. anyway it was the wong that didn't have that goofy grin and looks meaner. he plays a man who is hit over the head and suffers brain damage. he recovers and gets revenge. gordon liu is the only one worth seeing in this film, but he doesn't get to do much. but what little he does seems to make theothers pale in comparison. also, the film has some cheesy rubber hawk that the wong guy controls. this film is not worth renting or buying.

well i'd have to say that i do own this film and i only like the ending. the movie is boring and slow but the final fight is so funny. lets just say that if the fake bird didn't attack the main evil guy this movie would be a 0 out of 10. the bird though makes it a 3. if you are truly bored or want something terrible to watch rent this and fast forward to the final battle.

the credits at the end read "all directed by shigeru izumiya". that's a fitting way to phrase it because it seems like filmed material from several projects were thrown together somehow, barely even attempting to make it all form one consistent work. it more felt like one of those music clip things that are marketed as feature films to cash in on those video commercials, just that here we have the marketable music and the live performances missing, except for one scene, which may as well be marketed as a weird music video clip in japan. whatever.it makes zero sense. visually it isn't too special either, although it has its moments (for example the female creature with the "death powder" who is strapped onto a bed base and some morphing sh!t throughout) and it certainly has an industrial-y feeling to it. usually i'd call the effects dilettantish but what this film offers in this regard is baffling more than anything else. you remember those cheap video effects from 70's and 80's music videos that make them look so dated, like a picture within a picture flying through the screen? there is quite a lot of these kind of effects in this, and without any apparent reason. the most half-assed seeming effort comes in the form of a picture collage. the pictures sort of look like album covers. whatever.i don't know what's up with the subtitles of the version i saw. the chinese ones (or whatever those hieroglyphics are) sometimes seem to show up when nothing is even said and the english ones often show up without the chinese ones. the english subs talk much about life without death (is it possible?), and a mind without a body, which provides what comes closest to a comprehensible conflict between characters in this film. one guy (a scientist dude) says that life without flesh is death while another guy (a metamorphosing dude) who claims his mind is beyond his body now that he got the "death powder" blown into his face and that he now knows the secrets of the flesh and whatnot; metamorphosing dude is visibly p!ssed off about the scientist dude's claim. whatever.erm, the end - all written by perception de ambiguity

'gross misconduct' was one of a series of texts released in australia during the early-to-mid 1990s that explored the supposed victimisation of the privileged heterosexual male in the age of feminism. this creature only needs look at a pretty young thing, and he's accused of sexual harassment, and his life is ruined. damn those women's libbers! grrr...as my tone might suggest, i don't buy any of this anti-feminist bs, and correspondingly didn't enjoy this film. 'gm' trivialises the issues of sexual harassment and teacher-student relations. sexual harassment is here the product of a confused young woman's imagination, and those professional boundaries that teachers are meant to maintain ... well, when the teacher is a charming and handsome family man (and played by jimmy smits!), well needn't worry about those.sexist trash, and even by reviewing it, i'm giving it more time than it deserves.

university professor justin thorne (jimmy smits) has got it made. a good-looking, sophisticated teacher, with a loving wife and two adorable children. he plays the saxophone, owns an expensive car and his students love and respect him. but when temptation calls, in the form of one of his bright, pretty, sexy and willing students, jennifer carter (naomi watts), he foolishly gives in. the next day, he is being charged with her rape, and his perfect life could be forever ruined.when we see an american actor in australian film, we know we are not in for a masterpiece. but even viewed with low expectations, "gross misconduct" is a huge flop. based on a play with a rather unimaginative title and then adapted into a reasonably enjoyable book, it fails to engage, convince or even remotely interest its audience on a most fundamental level. the script is awkward and unconvincing; the acting is, for most part, not much better. watts gives an acceptable performance, demonstrating for one of the first times on screen her emotion rawness, but she is the only good thing about the film, which seems almost like even it can't wait to be over.the direction is not horrible or distracting in anyway, but it is just painfully mediocre. apart from the afore-mentioned naomi watts, who could be forgiven, seeing as this was early in her career, the acting is wooden and gets steadily worse over the course of the movie. the usually reliable jimmy smits doesn't seem to have been trying in this one, and who could really blame him? all these small failures, however, only add to the film's ultimate fatal flaw, which is that the focus is entirely in the wrong place. any empathy for the characters or interest in the outcome is lost in a sea of what is basically soft-core entertainment of an adult kind. by the end, audiences will probably be bored, tired and wishing they'd done something else with their ninety minutes. unless you just want to see naomi get naked 4 or 5 times, you could definitely afford to give this nonevent film a miss.

a tedious mixture of puerile efforts at humour with romantic relationship melodrama fails to provide this weakly made film with any flavour of reality. as action opens, reno (a.j. buckley) enters his apartment, there discovering his girlfriend in flagrante delicto with his roommate, who gloatingly tells reno "well, at least it's with someone you know", resulting in reno's decision to never have another roommate, this decision told to viewers by means of a soon abandoned voice-over. the storyline then proceeds ten months where we find that reno is indeed true to his word concerning avoidance of roommates, although this appears to beg the question due to his garnering of a live-in lover, holly (holly fields), with whom he has generated marital plans. the plot briefly shifts to a sleazy hollywood strip club, wherein reno's uncle charley, enamoured of a "dancer" whom he finds eminently desirable, keels over dead atop the club's bar after seeing the unadorned charms displayed by the object of his affections. it is apparent that charley had been aware of the flawed condition of his heart, because he created a video tape during which his commentary bequeaths his large (and mortgaged) residence in hollywood to reno, and we see the latter deciding to, contrary to his vow, interview applicants for two roommates as tenants, with he and holly sharing the selection process in an organized manner. following an inane sequence involving bizarre renter candidates, all of whom reno and holly unsurprisingly find unsuitable for living along with them in their house they, unknown to each other, each select a renter of the opposite sex, with the lovers manifestly cool toward the choice of their partner. the newcomers (chad and nicole) would seem to have little discernible point to their existence other than highly aural fornication with a broad range of partners, and it is not long before jealousy mars the harmonic relationship of reno and holly. reno is bent upon patenting and merchandising a type of sporting travel bag and, as he has given an engagement ring to holly, the potential success of this entrepreneurial adventure is of great financial significance if he intends to advance his marital plan. unfortunately, the rapacious team of chad and nicole, whose every action is ostensibly laced with lust, is likely to disrupt any future wedding intentions of reno. direction is slack, plainly far from fulfilling basic needs of the players, although an erratically composed script provides scant material with which actors may work, and ad libbing falls embarrassingly flat. as a result, the performances are undistinguished, not aided by spotty editing, while the manner of camera-work changes as abruptly and often as a firefly's tail light. filmed with a low budget and on location, only a modicum of skill is required for the designing processes, but a larger measure of value might have been placed upon the tasteless d.j. background soundtrack, generally blaring and nearly always invasive. a good deal of discussion has been stimulated by the movie's final sequences that are apparently not expected by a viewer based upon what has come before, but in reality these comprise probably the only thoughtful portions of a poorly cobbled screenplay, and bids fair to make the work almost watchable, despite the shabby quality of the production as a whole.

this is a typical college comedy and its very average. the story is ok but not very entertaining. its about a unlucky guy named reno who looses his job, gets his car ripped off and then his uncle dies in a stripbar. his got a girlfriend though (a nice one btw. :-). anyway this uncle gives him his mansion in la and mercedes as heritage and soon reno and his girlfriend moves to la to this new house. the problem is that they would need some roommates in order to pay the high rent for this house and so the film unfolds... the movie starts ok and has a few funny jokes here and there, but the suddenly the movie takes a turn straight down to hell... the ending is bad. really bad. it destroys everything about the movie. you will know what i'm talking about when you see the movie...2/10

oh boy.. this movie is so mediocre i don't really know what exactly to write about it. i think it's easier to write what it's not: it's not very entertaining. it's not original. and there's not one character in the whole movie i cared about.kind of reminds me of a certain reality tv show on mtv, but without any interesting people. it just drags on and on and i could hardly wait for it to end. the only thing that kept me from switching it off was jennifer lyons (c:i thought a long time about this movie to find one good thing to say about it. what i liked was the reminder not to judge a person by the first impression you get (as holly did when she accused nicole) which earns it a score of 2 out of 10 instead of a 1.

roomies is the story of a guy who loses everything except his incredible girlfriend and an idea for a corn dog that he plans to patent and sell. immediately his uncle dies and leaves him a house and a car, and he gets some roommates in to help pay the rent and gets a job. then his girlfriend gets drunk and cheats on him, so he goes and writes a book about roommates and becomes famous.88 minutes. none of these details of the plot are explored in any detail, what you read above is more or less as interesting as the film will be. when his uncle dies there are some breasts on screen, one of the potential roommates he interviews is pretty funny for about 40 seconds. the ending is literally the worst i've ever seen. i want the other 87 minutes of my life back!i hadn't thought anyone could make a movie with so little merit: surely there are rules against this sort of thing getting to the public? the script can't be longer than twenty pages, and the budget must have been minuscule because the whole film has about 3 locations and a car. the only conceivable use for roomies, in my opinion, is if you're holding someone hostage and want to frustrate them beyond human thought. if so, get it on repeat and you'll have a ready made gibbering wreck within the day.one-and-a-half out of 10

i had high hopes for this one after reading the back of the dvd, "in the spirit of american pie and animal house..." after suffering through this i realized i just blew $2.50 to rent it. this movie started out slow and just got slower... brief and fleeting moments of levity proved that it was in the spirit of american pie if you mean "spirit" as a dead thing. not very entertaining or fun! don't be fooled like i was and expect anything barely watchable because this movie will depress you more than entertain you. "need to fill up three more lines for this stupid movie that doesn't deserve the effort... what a stupid piece of ignorant crud. this movie wreaked, even the brief nudity sucked!

i saw this movie on video with a couple of friends as part of a teen comedy triple header, alongside dorm daze and going greek. obviously we weren't going for quality, but for air-headed entertainment and gross-out gags. generally we got what we came for, but wild roomies really stood out: for being awful.first impression first, the cover: the norwegian release cover showed breasts covered up and a bunch of seemingly "crazy" roomies in the background; brings up pictures of drunken semi-naked teenagers doing bunches of funny stuff stuff doesn't it?- the "crazy" roomies on the cover were not even featured in the picture. and the funny stuff you assume they'll be doing?- absent as well.this movie was labeled comedy, which is a bit strange since it not even remotely funny. relationship drama would be more accurate.put shortly the movie is about a young couple inheriting a swanky house in la, and are forced to get some roomies to make ends meet. these roommates eventually put both the young couple's patience and relationship to the test because they're so "wild". problem is, they're not. and here lies the problem of this movie: the protagonist couple are so anal-retentive and neurotic that they manage to generate zero sympathy. you'll find yourself rooting for the antagonist roomies halfway through the movie. add mediocre acting, lame dialogue and boring direction and you got yourself a movie that is best left unseen.see something else.

this film makes about as much sense as an 'ozzie & harriet' or a 'father knows best' episode. an old copy of reader's digest (circa 1962) would provide more insight into modern life, or the relationship between a father and a daughter, than this weird concoction.i was surprised with diane keaton. she appears to sleepwalk through the film. (given the film's title, i realize that hers was a supporting role but even martin short managed a distinct, supporting character.)i can understand the attraction of an imaginary world created in a good romantic comedy. but this film is the prozac version of an imaginary world. i'm frightened to consider that anyone could enjoy it even as pure fantasy.

diane keaton is a pathetic actress. she is so boring and phony. she is the same on and off screen. i saw her in an interview with ellen degeneres and she behaves exactly the same as she does in movies. her foolish facial expressions make me want to change channels. she has been in a couple of good movies, but they would have been better had someone else been picked for the part. steve martin doesn't add much to the movie either. he over acts as well and also ruins an old favorite. the ridiculous part martin short plays only adds more idiocies to the movie. i've tried to watch the movie twice but both times had to turn it off.

i like kevin bacon and cathy moriarty, and i love mary stuart masterson, but the movie wasn't good at all. there wasn't a likable character in the picture, and the plot was nearly non-existent.ms. masterson is a great actress, but she just didn't pull off the "tough girl" character. (she had similar problems with her character in the second day of christmas.) perhaps she should avoid these characters, especially those with an obnoxious female child to play off of.evan rachel wood was unimpressive. her character was a brat, plain and simple, and no young actress could have given harriet any positive feelings.in the interest of full disclosure, i couldn't even finish watching this picture. forty-five minutes of my time is enough to waste.

i tried to love this movie. i really did. kevin bacon plays a cerebral palsy victim who is befriended by a 10-year-old girl whose fantasies of digging to china, flying away in a balloon, and so on, are her way of coping with a dreary existence. i admit i did fast-forward through one of the scenes in which the two of them share friendship and simple pleasures while soulful piano music plays in the background. okay, three or four of those type scenes. maybe nine or ten. okay, okay, it was fourteen. but i did sit and watch most of them.

again such kind of zero-budget digital-video cam trash. and again i fell into this trap cuz the title had "zombie" in it (german title: zombie attack!) the story: on halloween some people visit the "museum of the dead", it's a trap, a crazy doctor wants to kill the people, everything connected to some aztec-cult. so they fight against some zombies in there.ultra cheap scenery: some corridors with black tape on it. a few dilettantish drawings and a few skulls as you can find them in every fun-shop. no actors, just low-grade models waking around with absolutely no idea what to do. no effects. laughable make-up, your local hobby-make-up-zombie-fan will do it better, some time it looked as if they had not enough money for enough colour, otherwise they just could not do it like this, man, they have to realize the looks of their "zombies". some laughable martial-arts fights with the zombies, slow-motion. just, when the director wants to have it scary he uses some standard digital-video-cam effect where everything is flackering. unbelievable! 0 out of 10!

a study in bad. bad direction, bad acting, bad writing and f/x that´ll teach you that you´d better upgrade your computer before filming. it´s the kind of flick you used to do totally drunk in your cellar with dad´s camera when you were young at heart. but you certainly would not show it in public when you´re sober again, would you? you wouldn´t even view it. avoid at all costs.

that's the worst film i saw since a long time. historic accuracy is totally non-existent. for example, james wolfe, who his depicted as an anti-french canadian, is shown in london during the summer of 1759. natives are like indians of a bad hollywood movie of the 60's : they wear deerskin clothes and ride horses (the montagnais had never ride horses). the film is taking place in quebec city, but footage is set in louisbourg, showing the atlantic ocean.the original scenario was supposed to include the battle of the plains of abraham, but the producers drop this idea saying that costs for uniforms and participants would be more than 4 millions dollars ! i think they never heard about re-enactment.all the movie is planned to be a new titanic : an impossible love during an historic tragedy (the fall of new-france). there's even a song performed by celine dion at the end of the movie (yes, i stayed till the end of the movie, but i deeply regret). but the worst thing of all is that this movie cost 30 millions dollars. i just don't know how they spend all this money.sorry for my anger, but i'm just too irritated.

i absolutely could not believe the levels of ineptitude on display in this production. i honestly thought gay men had better taste than this. i know i do.the bulk of the blame doesn't lie with the cast, but let's get them out of the way first...the only one with real talent was joe souza (plus he had the best bod in the cast). he had a nice, clear theatre-style voice. okay, and jaymes hodges' voice was so-so, but he had a vacant expression in every number. the rest couldn't hold a note in a bucket, even though the music was obviously dubbed in after the fact. must have been really dreadful hearing them live. they were also all girly-boys except for maybe three. if i wanted to see naked women onstage i could go to the titty bars. not sure why anyone would choose to film the l.a. production instead of new york. i would imagine ny has more readily available singing talent, though one would think in l.a. they would be able to find better-looking guys. apparently not.but i digress...the real blame here lies with the creators and producers. this score was the most banal, insipid tripe i have ever heard. it sounded like some theatre queens took all their musical cd's, threw them in a blender and poured the goo onto a page. sadly, i'm sure there are many who can't tell the difference between good theatre writing and whatever this is. i mean seriously, i was laughing my ass off through the whole thing but not at the lame jokes. i think the morbid 'my-lover-has-died-of-aids-song' entitled "kris, look what you've missed" was the most hysterical thing in the whole show. genius writing...kris / missed...wow...they almost rhyme...must be a good lyric. and jesus...the end of that song..."oh kris, ohhh kris, ohhhh kris..." over and over!!! my other favorite was "you gotta be a pumpy junkie boy to be a humpy hunkie boy"...wtf??? the whole show was full of the most arbitrary lyrics just because they rhymed. where did these people learn to write songs? apparently they listened to sondheim and said "he's not so great, i can do that"...as evidenced by the retarded "bobby, bobby, bobby" reference from company in one song. another irk: why are 20-somethings singing about robert mitchum and tab hunter? obviously coming from the mouths of the lyricists and not the actors...again, bad writing.if you love torture and pain, and i know many of you strange fetishists do, go ahead and watch it. but you've been warned.

i'm writing this as i watch the dvd. i grabbed for the laptop and went to imdb during the first song. i didn't know anything about the movie except that a friend said that the show was supposed to be good. it has a decent netflix rating too, so here i am.maybe on the stage this worked. but i have to say that the sight of chorus boys dancing and singing completely naked just seems silly. and the lip syncing to a prerecorded score adds to the strangeness.most of the songs and routines are about aspects of male nudity. this is my idea of nothing, sorry. the score, so far, is generic show tune music. nothing memorable, or particularly melodic. everything is to serve the lyrics. which, i have to say, sound like they were written by a committee. each song is essentially one extended joke. if the jokes were ten seconds, they might work. these single several-minute-long jokes don't.i'm now watching the movie by chapters--a few minutes until i get the gist. kind of in the hopes that one of them will be different, or entertaining enough to keep me from going on to the next scene. nope.okay. i'm finished. so here's what i think. if you have any experience or long-standing appreciation of musical theater, avoid this--it's just not quality. if, however, you're a gay twenty-something and have never seen or heard a musical comedy, you might be entertained. or maybe this would hold your interest if you've never seen a lot of attractive naked men. i have.

this show has been performed live around the country with a wide variety of casts. i saw it first in the provincetown production the first summer it was in p-town (2001)--before it was, curiously enough, banned in that overwhelmingly gay resort (the codes which resulted in its closing have since been amended). i saw it again later in the off-broadway, long-running production in new york. oddly enough, the p-town production was far better than the new york one--fresher, cuter, more spirited and funnier--but that was only in the 2001 showing; subsequent attempts to clone the production ("bare naked lads" in 2007) were definitely third-rate. this filmed production features a los angelos production cast, and it is, as other comments have suggested, not the best. i would rate it somewhere in between the top-notch 2001 p-town production and the third-rate "bare naked lads" p-town show from last summer.

first off, i'm in the u.s.when i first saw this, i thought it was an obvious - and loathsome - rip off of "the office" (uk). i would have thus awarded it zero stars, but lo and behold, it came out long before the ricky gervais series.still, it's hard to watch this or any other show with a similar dynamic (including the american "office") without comparison. it just isn't even close to being the same thing.i will give it some credit for being original, and ahead of its time. i'll also say that it - and the u.s. "office" and "larry sanders" - are actual satires. the uk "office" is something grander and more transcendent, as if populated with real people in events that felt like they actually happened. however, unlike this or the shrill christopher guest "mockumentaries", it isn't really a satire, while "the newsroom" definitely is.be that as it may, "the newsroom" still isn't very funny. it's aloof, and self-aware, but with a cast and crew not nearly smart or talented enough to heft the goods. it's weighty comedy being carried on weak shoulders. commendable, but ultimately not recommended.--- and what's with the lack of an anamorphic dvd?! i know it was shot in anamorphic widescreen, because i saw the pilot episode on one of our hd channels. cbc, get with the programme. ; )

talented screenwriter alvin sargent sadly cannot get any engaging ideas cooking in this artificial trifle about a wayward mother and her mature teenage daughter trying to make their lives work in los angeles despite mom's flighty behavior. apart from several good sequences, i didn't quite buy susan sarandon as a flake (she's too intrinsically smart and focused to be passed off as this devil-may-care lady), and her naturally grounded personality is a bad fit for the role of an irresponsible parent. natalie portman fares much better as her kid, and yet there's a creepy aloofness to her work (and some of her scenes, such as the one where she asks a boy to strip, are misguided and uncomfortable to watch). certainly not an incompetent piece, "anywhere but here" does have moments that work, but it isn't an embraceable film, nor has it proved to be an important one. ** from ****

clearly, andreas bethmann would like to wear jess franco's crown whilst coveting (at least cinematically) the old workhorse's wife, lina romay. romay plays a corrupt, salacious, masturbating prison warden in this modern, ambitious w.i.p. film. with some exceptions, many of franco's films are ineptly produced and directed in a slipshod, hurried manner. shots don't always cut together and the sound mixes can be horrific. while watching "angel of death 2" (aka "prison island massacre") i asked myself if bethmann is deliberately trying to replicate franco's patent shoddiness, or is he just naturally shoddy like his mentor? is this movie deliberately bad, which would be self-defeating, or is it simply bad by neglect? after a hitchhiker is forced to give a gunpoint blowjob, her rapist fills her mouth, then fills her vagina with some drugs. minutes later, she is hauled into a clifftop prison for reasons not explained and subjected to the leers and rough handling of staff and other inmates. as this is a wip film, there are lesbian scenes galore and plenty of violent behavior. the gore is bloody and sadistic, too, with delights such as teeth pulling and scalping (courtesy of olaf ittenbach). the acting is pretty awful and the fight scenes are lame, but there is a love of sleaze in every frame and an understanding of what trash fans enjoy. unfortunately, the flat script makes for a flat movie. so, despite numerous atrocities, hardcore sex, and a guest appearance from jess franco, the experience is an empty one. but isn't that what most jess franco movies are?

i watched this movie on tv last night, hoping for a realistic account of what could happen if there were an outbreak of some highly transmittable disease. i was disappointed, and i think the movie was garbage. it did not seem real to me. some of the acting was awful, in particular that of the doctor. she was about the worst i've seen. the whole thing played like a cnn 'worst case scenario'. even the obligatory disaster movie human relations bits didn't seem sincere. i have seen some disaster movies, in particular those weather ones, which are actually so bad they are amusing. this one is almost as bad, but it is not even amusing, it is tedious and boring.don't bother with this one.

fatal contact: bird flu in america: 3 out of 10: this movie is both funny and sad. the funny part is fairly obvious as this certainly isn't a sober look at a possible impending crisis. this is a modern version of the swarm. and much like those killer bees (and the so called killer bee crisis that prompted them) bird flu has joined a pantheon of media inspired end of the world scenarios (sars, y2k, global warming) that simply refuse to actually come about.the sad part is the blatant attempt of the filmmakers to inspire panic. disease pandemics historically were fairly common after all people didn't all die in their forties from heart disease. even recent pandemics such as aids mirrors the old fashioned vd crisis (think syphilis) that used to kill more soldiers than bullets.the flu pandemic of the early twenties was a nasty business killing millions but honestly life went on. i wonder if our over dramatic media and their power hungry government allies would allow life as normal today.the movie itself swerves wildly from fairly competent scenes (triage in grand central station) to the ridiculous (rednecks try to ambush national guardsman in manhattan).the scenarios themselves are fairly useless as the filmmakers can't seem to decide exactly how contagious the bird flu is or for that matter whether the symptoms are an ebola style crash or simply a long illness. indeed one scene will show everyone in bio-hazard suits and the next will have nobody even wearing a mask.the film also patently refuses to actually give any practical advice regarding what to do in a bird flu crisis. (outside of wash your hands, what no duct tape?) the acting and directing are competent for a tv movie but the script is all over the map. last the movie has a strangely non-exponential death total running on the bottom of the screen. just like the swarm did.

the c class cast and poorly transitioned scenes, complete with terrible acting have led me too believe this would make a good tv only release such as the fx presentation of a smallpox outbreak. at my local blockbuster however, about 9 copies are held on the shelves, none of which were checked out when i rented the title (i wonder why....) anyway, this title was almost ridiculous in the "fear factor" the director was going for. the whole "death count" on the bottom of the screen completely contradicted the plot at times, such as when the chopper was going over angola, and the toll was speeding at a breakneck pace from 23 million to 24. however, as the movie ends, (possibly several hours or even a day or so after the chopper has landed) the death toll counter is reset back too what it was at the moment the chopper was approaching the area. the movies end left a huge whole in th entire plot, and god knows nobody is waiting for the sequel. anyway, do not rent this, i only advise watching this if you have obtained the title with no monetary loss, and you are in the mood for a cheesy suspense movie.

what garbage, is there actually no part ii? if this movie actually ends the way it did, everyone involved with this movie should be ashamed. this movie is nothing close to a movie like outbreak, which was actually a fairly decent movie. this movie was rushed in hopes of being able to gain a few easy dollars. i started watching the movie under the assumption that it would be bad, but i never imagined it would be this bad. this movie was nothing more then a way to exploit the fears of the american people for profit! if you have not seen this movie, don't bother. movie is full of poorly developed characters and poor acting. i really hope the production of this movie was only a couple of weeks. stay away! don't be fooled by the hype!

after spending half an hour examining rumors, a gay bar located outside tupelo, mississippi, small town gay bar shifts focus to the murder of scotty weaver in bay minette in order to demonstrate the risks run by the interview subjects. but there is a problem here. bay minette isn't near tupelo, as the film implies. it isn't even in the same state. it is actually about three hundred miles away in coastal alabama.director malcom ingram doesn't exactly rush to point out this fact, nor does he bother to mention that while bay minette itself is little more than a wide spot in the road, it is actually about two deep breaths away from the major metro area of mobile, alabama--which has a noticeable gay community, quite a few gay bars, and even a congregation of metropolitan community church. if ingram is disingenuous on these points, one has to ask if he is on others as well.speaking as someone who was born, raised, and continues to live in mississippi, i have to say that i find most of small town gay bar a lot of hooey. neither meridian nor tupelo, the communities upon which ingram focuses, are as rural, small, or as isolated as he would have you imagine, and gay bars are indeed more common in the state than the film implies. that said, ingram rather blithely ignores the fact that the absence of a gay bar does not mean an absence of a gay community, and in doing so he demonstrates a rather profound ignorance of southern culture, which tends to hold those who frequent bars--be they gay or straight--in low esteem.small town gay bar is, in my opinion, an instance in which a film maker came to his subject with a personal agenda in hand and then proceeded to film the agenda. do gays and lesbians living in rural mississippi face major, sometimes frightening challenges? you bet they do--but that's no excuse for fiddling with reality to such a degree. the dvd includes a commentary track and a number of deleted scenes, but i found the feature film itself so ridiculous that i didn't waste any time on them.gft, amazon reviewer

maybe it's unfair to dislike a movie for what it isn't, rather than what it is, but i approached this hoping that finally a filmmaker would make a movie about small-town rural gay men and women. instead, the focus is primarily on the outrageous bigotry (big news!) of the locals (and those in outlying areas) and the really gruesome torture/murder of a young gay man.so much time devoted to stupid people squawking about aids, sin, hellfire, and perverts. so much time devoted to the ghoulish preacher ranting about the bible and gay people getting what they deserve.i wanted to see more of the people that came to the "small town gay bar", not those who opposed it. in addition, the young man who was murdered isn't even from this town.the whole movie works as a warning rather than a celebration, and it's very suspect.

sure, it's hard being gay, especially in the south. we get it. over... and over again.what stood out was that the film makers focused almost wholly on the more "extreme" characters in these small town gay bars; the drag queens, the seedy sleaze of a bar long-closed, and on a guy who was brutally murdered for being gay, yet had nothing to do with either of the bars which were the focus of this film.there were snippets of interviews from other people, people viewers would, perhaps, be better able to relate to. but they were glossed over, practically skipped, maybe shown in a glimpse in the background.it would have been more interesting, to me at least, to hear the experiences of the more common gay men and women who were either enriched or otherwise by the experiences of a small town gay bar and/or the absence of that community.

i was ready for a crouching tiger style movie and all i got was the worst movie i've seen in years. it was almost as bad as baron von munchhuasen. dead script. dead acting. dead everything. granted there was some good fight scenes but the positive side ends there. if this movie arrives in your house run screming to a phone and dial 911 and say, "please help there is a movie in my house meant to force people to commit suicide"

this film is about a couple that decides to take a vacation to the everglades along with another couple and the family dog. when they first get there, they are not welcomed by the neighboring gas attendant that warms them to stay away from the cabin in which they are to spend the night at for the week. after pestering with the old man, three hillbillys also do not take kindly to their arrival as they approach their car and threaten them to leave. after asking some of the local dummies that can't speak or just don't want to answer, they finaly find the cabin. after they settle in, strange things happen to the visitors including discovering crap on their car, the man thats the head of this trip thats an idiot shoots the family dog thinking it was a killer clawing at the door and a series of deaths later on in the end. adding a church group did not make the story any better. then at the end, the idiot that survives the whole ordeal goes around the town carrying a shot gun. lame. thats what this movie is.

this has to be one of the most awfully scripted films i've ever seen. it's basically a remake of the beast from 20,000 fathoms (1953), but done with your standard snake-like puppet-monster instead of a sleek ray harryhausen creation. combine the plot of that classic monster movie with the production qualities and acting level of the creeping terror and you have an idea of what this movie is like.the movie is dubbed, although by the original actors (i think that the movie was originally dubbed in italian for that countries audiences, then redubbed for us release), which just makes the movie seem weird...the sounds, like in a japanese monster movie, just don't quite match properly to the action on the screen, even if the actors' lips are moving properly.poor ray milland...he's certainly come a long way down from the lost weekend or dial m for murder or any of the number of excellent movies he was in. add this to his other sci-fi travesties (panic in the year zero, x the man with x-ray eyes) and you can see a once good actor fallen into a boris karloff syndrome...stuck doing really bad horror films in foreign countries just for the work.

this is the worst movie i have ever seen. a movie that is about a stupid looking monster from the ocean that threatens a small town which has to be filled with the dumbest people on earth.spoilers if you even carethey can't even kill the damn thing by the end of the movie. the movie ends and they're like, "well, some day we'll have to kill it."avoid at all costs.

and abysmal, over-the-top acting, you might enjoy this rubbish flick.apparently atomic bombs makes life mutate in about a day or two (or according to other viewers, wake them up). or so it seems. and apparently massive atomic explosions off the coast of spain doesn't make anyone ask any questions at all. coming to think of it, the plot doesn't make sense in any way whatsoever (why would evil sock puppets attack lighthouses?), so the nukes going off for no reason at all doesn't stand out too much.ok, getting past this, and the fact that the "monster" is a glorified thing you make of socks in kindergarten, you may actually be able to stand this. but for once the complete lack of gore doesn't help, leaving the monster attacks in all their naked rock-bottom-budget "glory".i doubt you'll be able to watch this though, so better stay well away.

this film has me seriously doubting again whether armando de ossorio was a good filmmaker or not... his blind dead films are praised by many fans. this i can understand. but wanna-be gothic vampire trite like malenka doesn't show any signs from a gifted filmmaker. and that also goes for serpiente de mar. it features horrible acting, a dumb plot, stupid events, a lot of other things you can expect from a bad monster-movie and also veteran actor ray milland, who does his best to mumble his way through this film while not having much of a clue about what he's doing in it. apparently milland was already very ill while shooting serpiente de mar (his last theatrical feature) and going out with a ridiculous stinker like this, makes it all the more sad. one last appearance alongside peter cushing in a made-for-tv film directed by roy ward baker (also in 1984) doesn't change much about it.but the sock puppet/sea serpent is a hoot to behold. watch it swirl up a lighthouse and crush it. see it destroy a harbour with miniature boats. look at it demolish bridges and munch on charming miniature trains.good badness? yes. 3/10 and 7/10

amando deossorio was never one to let a lack of budget get in the way of telling one of his stories. his "blind dead" series started off great but had some truly laughable moments, such as shots of a small model boat in a water tank for "the ghost galleon". in "the sea serpent", he hits rock bottom and takes some notable actors along with him, telling the tale of a silly sock monster that brings google-eyed terror to a few water tanks and miniature aquariums.a vague opening sequence sets the stage and demonstrates an aborted military mission where american pilots, for some unknown reason, drop an atomic bomb (brazenly cartooned into the frame of the film) somewhere in the ocean off the coast of spain. the military commander gives this order from an office that features a prominent american flag and a portrait of a deranged-looking ronald reagan, one of only a few things that makes this movie really seem like the eighties. the other two are the hilariously inept subtitle that declares the year to be "1.985" and tyria power's dated sheena easton hairdo, which would have looked really cool next to some ripped neon sweats.one of the kookiest monsters you will ever see rises from the depths, disturbed by the explosion caused by the bomb. we learn that the errant atom bomb has killed off a great deal of the local fish. unfortunately for our cast, it has no effect on the sea serpent, which swiftly descends on the coast of spain for some miniature-set mayhem.now when i say the monster is unrealistic, i am not exaggerating. it's not just "sort of" fake looking. i'm sure the filmmakers did the best with the ten dollars that they seem to have been allotted, but most of the time it looks like it was made out of crayola markers, a ping pong ball, and an old sock. not only that, it has this ominous music that accompanies it wherever it goes, music that sounds so much like the "jaws" theme that it's a wonder nobody got sued.along with tyria power, timothy bottoms and ray milland are caught slumming, and the dialogue could not have been any more dismal. through a series of plot contrivances, our leading actors are thrown together in a quest to...well, i'm not sure what the purpose is. bottoms and power have got to prove the serpent is real in order to save their butts (he is blamed for a serpent-induced shipwreck, she is locked in the loony bin after a sighting). none of this matters, because by the end of the movie nothing has been resolved. nobody admits the serpent is real, and it's not even dead. furthermore, power and bottoms are still on the lam from the law. as illogical as it seems, nobody but our heroes knows that the serpent exists (despite numerous disappearances, a trashed lighthouse, and a crushed railroad bridge), and they embark on an extended non-adventure to track down and chase the monster away...not kill it, since they know they are no match for it. their big plan is to use flares to scare it off. although their scheme is botched, the serpent causes a big explosion in the water after it attacks a bridge support (don't ask), and the giant sea snake is so frightened that it swims away. the critical viewer would wonder why the serpent wasn't frightened off earlier in the movie when it caused a couple of big explosions after crashing into a dock. but never mind. it swims away, and our heroes are sure it's gone forever. the end.i can only imagine the horror that the stars felt when they saw the completed film they just worked on. a lamebrain script and a couple of dim reaction shots could never have prepared them for the embarrassment of sharing screen time with a spliced-in sock puppet/stop motion beastie. at least the supporting characters got to have fun screaming and pretending to be swallowed by a giant serpent head. i'm not sure what was going on when they made this movie; the monster is cheap, but there are some rather elaborate miniature sets, so somebody did spend some time making those, not to mention the stop-motion animation involved. it's seemingly played straight, although maybe this film's sense of humor went over my head. in the end, the film is nothing more than an easy target for a drunken commentary. watch it at a party for best results.

i absolutely positively can't believe my fellow imdb reviewers. all the praise about how "original" this movie is, it's like they've never seen "ring" or the million of imitations that's come out in the 10 years since that movie. and some of them claim to be horror movie buffs! i think not! "shutter" is okay. average, i'd say. i give it 5 out of 10, but there's just no way it's original and great and "the most frightening thing i've ever seen" as one reviewer said. puh-leeeze, people. this one is plain. it's predictable.i swear, if i see another ghost movie where the hero traces the past of the ghost in order to find out why she's so mad and after them, i'm going to scream."original"? give me a break. you people need to get out more. or at least stop calling yourselves "horror movie fans".

an obscure horror show filmed in the everglades. two couples stay overnight in a cabin after being made a little uneasy by the unfriendliness of the locals. who, or what, are the blood stalkers? after awhile they find out. watch for the character of the village idiot who clucks like a chicken, he certainly is weird.

after his success with a nightmare on elm street in 1984, director wes craven for some reason decided that his next project would be this tv movie. i'm not a big fan of this director on the whole; early exploitation flick the last house on the left as well as his modern slasher scream sit well with me, but the rest of his work is very hit and miss and i'd hesitate to call him the master that others have labelled him as. the main theme here is cryogenic freezing, although it's more a springboard for the plot rather than an important part of the movie. the main influence here is obviously the excellent 1974 zombie film deathdream and we focus on miles creighton; a businessman cryogenically frozen for ten years before an accident that means he has to be thawed out immediately. miles is a part of a project for people that are ill; they pay to be frozen in the hope that they will be revived in the future when their illnesses can cured. miles is successfully revived and it's seen as a miracle...but the person that wakes up is not the person who was frozen, as miles returns without a soul.this film could actually have been quite decent judging by the idea behind it, but instead we're given a plot that doesn't really have a lot to it and it has to be said that craven doesn't make the best out of the potential of the film. the 'soul' is the main focal point, but it would seem that not having a soul and simply having a murderous intent/no compassion are the same thing, which feels a bit unimaginative. the film was made for television so it's not particularly nasty and it's obvious that not a lot of money was spent on it as the whole production feels very cheap. michael beck never became a very popular actor and that isn't surprising judging by his performance here; while he is passable, he largely lacks charisma and is not formidable in the central role. the plot doesn't flow too badly but there's a real lack of suspense and/or tension and things slow down too much too often, which results in the film being rather boring on occasion. it all boils down to a predictable ending also. overall, i have to admit that i was not impressed at all by this film and as far as craven's filmography goes, chiller would have to go down with shocker, the scream sequels and the hills have eyes ii as a miss.

prior to airport 79' these movies were rather good. they had decent special effects, all-star cast, and good acting. this movie destroyed the franchise, and there are many reasons for it. lets talk about the special effects wow!!!! they are horrific, what was the director thinking about. i know it's only 1979, but lets look at other very good special effects movies such as star wars(1977),and moonraker(1979). i like the idea of the concord and this could of been the best airport movie, but they did too much with it. how about joe patroni(george kennedey) shooting a flare out of the cockpit window, to prevent a heat seeking missile from hitting the concord. also he is doing 90 degree dives and loops. this completely far fetched, and unrealistic wow!!!!!! believe me the special effects don't help this scene, and really are beyond poor.... they almost look like a cartoon, and this is how the whole movie is!!!finally lets talk about the acting which in my opinion is extremely poor to fair at best.... over acting is a major issue in this movie, especially george kennedy.. which i really like as an actor, but just doesn't cut in this movie. the full blame has to go on the director, who did a very poor editing job, and really whacked out the airport franchise. too bad the concord isn't still used today it was a marvel of air travel...

this final installment of the "airport" franchise was so incredibly awful that it took me awhile to realize it actually wasn't a slapstick comedy, like "airplane". george kennedy shooting a flare gun out an open window to divert heat-seeking missiles was comical. what would happen to your hand if you held it out a window at mach two speed? you'd lose your grip on the gun and get a broken arm. the passengers were unintentionally hilarious, as was the interior of the plane. the sophisticated french woman coming on to slobby george kennedy was like jackie kennedy coming on to ernest borgnine. ain't gonna happen. susan blakely, a talented and unappreciated actress, did not get any points on her resume for this one. neither did robert wagner. this movie was so lousy it seemed surreal.

i just saw this movie on tnt and let me tell you, this movie was downright corny and cheezy. but after a certain point, i began to laugh my socks off and to tell you the truth, they should classify this movie as comedy rather than action/adventure. the absolutely most hilarious scene comes when the delon and kennedy are making loop the loop 360's to avoid the french missiles that wagner ordered to destroy the concorde. our fearless leader, kennedy, decides to shoot flares out the window to stop the heat seeking missiles????? dumb yet funny---the kicker comes here though---after one shot, the flare gun malfunctions and kennedy tries to fix it in the cockpit and well...if you want to know what happens get a hold of this movie. the dumb parts of this movie include the total lack of plot----yeah lets have some action for 25 minutes than land in paris and go one hour with love scenes with prostitutes and flight attendants. now lets switch to the saboteur for ten minutes then a wasted rest of the movie and a plane that is visually breaking apart and the passengers don"t even see it???? its right in front of their eyes!!!!-----final rating for this move--- (1/10) out of 4 stars if it were action 2 out of 4 stars if it were a comedy

its a truly awful movie with a laughable storyline.some awful acting.and a script that ed wood might be ashamed of.wagner is laughable in this. he plays his role like number two in austin powers.easily the worst of the airport movies.1 out of 10

'airport 4' is basically a slopped together mess for universal studios to try and work a new twist - the concorde supersonic airliner - into their 'disaster-in-the-sky' formula.bogged down with unintentional humor, the best of which is when george kennedy sticks his hand out of concorde's window at supersonic speed to fire a flare gun at a heat-seeking missile following the aircraft's flight path, and the simple fact that these dumb passengers keep re-boarding the same plane to continue their flight despite all the problems in the air. many stars in this one including robert wagner, sylvia kristel, alain delon, and martha raye as a nervous passenger. not really related to the other 'airport' films.

the concorde ... airport '79 starts in washington where a man named carl parker (macon (mccalman) contacts high profile tv news reporter maggie whelan (susan blakely) in order to hand secret documents over that prove his boss kevin harriosn (robert wagner) owner & president of harrison industries that develop weapons for the military has been illegally selling said weapons to foreign countries. however maggie sees carl assassinated & she barely escapes with her life, maggie is to catch the concorde to moscow via paris the next morning & intends to blow the whistle on harrison who also happens to be her boyfriend which would ruin him. determined to save himself he reprogrammes his hi-tech 'buzzard' homing missile to intercept & destroy the concorde during a test run killing all those on-board & destroying the documented evidence...renamed airport '80 - the concorde for it's cinema & initial home video releases because it was released here in, well, 1980 rather than 1979 this last entry in the airport franchise was directed by david lowell rich & is a notoriously bad film that was apparently laughed at during press & test screenings prompting universal to promote the film as an action comedy. the first thing to say is that the concorde ... airport '79 is a really silly & downright daft film but on a purely entertainment basis i can think of a lot worse films to spend 108 minutes watching, i really can. i quite liked the absurd plot about a wealthy industrialist wanting to kill his girlfriend tv reporter before she can expose him as an illegal arms dealer but this guy doesn't do subtle & decides the best way to do it is to blow concorde up with his own guided missile & then gets a fench fighter pilot to try & shoot it down before finally sabotaging it so really there's three mini disaster flicks in one here as each time super pilot joe patroni manages to save the day. you know joe patroni played by george kennedy appears in all four airport films & goes from mechanic in the first to concorde pilot extrodinaire in this, also i reckon he's a bit of a jinx since in the space of nine years he has been involved with four major aviation disasters. i think the real reason why the airport series stopped here was because patroni retired after this & the jinx was lifted. some of the things that happen here are just silly, patroni does barrel rolls, flies upside-down & out manoeuvre's a guided missile in a huge concorde not to mention he crash lands it & fires flare guns out of his window to destroy the missile all while keeping a calm head. this guy is good, very good. then there's the character's, there's a saxophone playing black dude who smokes weed in the toilets, an old woman with a bladder problem & a team of russian gymnasts with bad accents. also, despite being almost shot down with a missile & then attacked by a jet fighter the passengers of concorde don't seem that bothered & happily get back aboard the following day, i don't know about you but after that i would probably find a safer way to travel & why do the police or authorities not question anyone? why is the concorde captain patroni allowed to just go off & sleep with a french prostitute? the concorde ... airport '79 certainly isn't boring & is full of memorable moments & i was entertained in a way although it's far from a good film & modern audiences may not have the patience with it, hell i liked it for what it was in a daft way but it's no sort of classic.even though concorde no longer flies it's still quite a cool looking air-plane & there's plenty of footage of it here, the one used in the concorde ... airport '79 was the seventh one built. this concorde was also the same aircraft which crashed after a tire bust caused a fuel tank to rupture and the leaking fuel catch fire on july 25th 2000, while taking off in paris sadly resulting in the death of 109 passengers and crew on board and 4 people on the ground. when this aired on tv in the us in 1982 almost twenty minutes of new footage was included with most if not all of it being newly shot over two years after the original production had finished. i know the effects here take a bashing from most but i don't reckon they are too bad, when you consider this was made in the late 70's i think they come across quite well. the camera moves during effects shots, real footage of real planes is used rather than toy models which in my opinion would have looked a lot worse & i could certainly see what the makers were trying to do with limited funds & limited technology. in a strange way they are quite impressive actually without ever looking that good if you know what i mean. probably the most action packed of all the airport films there's missiles, exploding planes, daring crash landings, assassinations & a guy named robert palmer (no, not the singer) giving head a woman in a jacuzzi.the imdb says this had a budget of about $14,000,000 which is actually more than i thought, maybe those special effects aren't so impressive after all. shot in utah, washington, los angeles & france. the acting isn't great here, people don't look worried enough that they are about to die. goerge kennedy gets some bad one-liners while robert wagner plays the bad guy.the concorde ... airport '79 is fun for bad film enthusiasts everywhere & to be brutally honest i rather watch this entertaining mess of a film than some two hour oscar nominated bore.

there is a special heaven reserved for people who make the world laugh. alongside chaplin,stan and ollie,the marx bros and.....(fill in your own special favourites)space must be made for everybody connected with "airport 80 - concorde,the movie". robert wagner in particular exceeds all expectations giving the comedy performance of a lifetime.i would never have thought he had it in him. the only way he could have been funnier would have been to have worn a red nose and a revolving bow tie. british moviegoers will recognise the fat one from cannon and ball pretending to be a russian athlete,a nice trick if he could have pulled it off but,tragically,he couldn't.i have a 14 year old labrador more athletic and almost as funny. george kennedy - bless him - has a part that requires him talk and move at the same time,and my goodness he triumphs!brow wrinkled with effort he utters timeless dialogue,each word lovingly polished into coward-like brilliance. only once in twenty years does hollywood turn out a film like "airport 80".all the years of toil and struggle,the sweat,the tears,the lessons with lee strasberg,living out of suitcases,born in a trunk etc etc,all come to fruition.a work of art is created that will last as long as there are movies and machines to show them on. i think i'm ready for my medication now.

this film is an absolute disgrace! i thoroughly enjoyed the original airport, and i can't believe how the same people could produce this twaddle nine years on. first of all, the acting is bad. the original had actors who had done quality (non-disaster) films before, but this one uses actors who have done the disaster movie circuit already (blakely, kennedy, wagner). also, george kennedy's character patroni seems to get promoted very quickly. he is now the lead in the film, but his character isn't strong enough to carry it off: he has lost the charm and humour of airport (1970), and the character is now just boring. have i mentioned the plot? is it at all believable that someone would send a missile after the concorde?? no!!! there are also too many loose ends; scenes that have no relevance whatsoever to the plot. the scene where the hot air balloon lands on the runway, the chase of the thief in charles de gaulle airport are two such scenes. both would be interesting - if only they had something to do with the actual story. there also many unanswered questions: why does patroni open the window and fire a flare at the other plane? why does robert wagner's character kill himself? (he must have another stupid and costly way of why is there no enquiry after the missile almost blows up the concorde? why are the back projections so bad? (it looks as though a cartoon missile is following the concorde; although it does work well when the plane lands in paris) why does patroni think that he is in a flight simulator? (when he turns the concorde over) why does he get a hero's welcome in the cabin of the plane after having terrified the passengers? and why is the ending so poor, if it can be called an ending at all? given their one-dimensional-ness, no-one seems to notice this. the blessing given to the young couple on the plane by the girl's coach is shmaltzy, the man who plays the saxophone is annoying, and the woman with the bladder problem is just plain silly. the scenes where susan blakely is lying on the roof of her conservatory, and the when she tells wagner that she still loves him are quite awful. in conclusion, this film should have been the climax of the previous three airport films: instead it is a diabolical, sub-moronic, complete and utter waste of time, money, energy, celluloid and "talent"!!!!!!! remember when patroni asks the french pilot if he has "ever landed on his belly?" this film certainly does the belly flop, and lands flat on its pointy nose...

warning **spoilers**lord knows i have seen some bad movies in my time and this one makes me just as angry. this is an insult to people who are looking for a bad movie. the "story" involves a stewardess who discovers her boyfriend (badly acted by otherwise great robert wagner) is a murder, thief, and just an overall puke face. after the concorde takes off, he sends guided missiles to destroy the concorde. so while the concorde is traveling at the speed of light, our "hero" (played with utter stupidity, george kennedy) opens the window in the cockpit then, sticks his hand out the window to fire at the missile! i'm no rocket scientist, but it seems his hand would at least get a wind burn. then towards the final "climax" when the concorde is headed for certain disaster and everyone will die, a passenger turns to his fiance and proposes marriage. a priest just happens to be sitting in the next row and proceeds to marry them as the planes is crashing! (i'm not making this up) wow, the guy who wrote the script must have been sniffing glue for a week.

i gave "airport '79" only two stars because it's a truly lousy film. nobody who had anything to do with it deserves any praise (except for charo's chihuahua, who does a pretty good job in his role.) this is not to say that the film isn't worth watching. it helps if you have a buzz on, but this is not essential.a'79 really does seem like an early version of "airplane!" every scene has a set-up and a payoff, and the scenes blunder after one another as if they were totally disconnected. one of my favorite recurring points is that the passengers, crew, and airplane get to keep going, no matter what. you're a news reporter and a strange guy gets murdered at your house in your presence? the hit-man then chases you onto your greenhouse roof? no problem. you can still catch that early-morning flight to paris...no need to get the cops involved. your plane dodges one unmanned "drone" missile, four heat-seeking missiles, and cannon fire from an unidentified phantom fighter, doing barrel rolls, an unpowered dive, and a crash-net landing without thrust reversers in the process? no problem, we'll have the mechanics check the oil and get you on your way in just a few hours. it's truly funny.and i'll admit that there's a bit of the anarchist in me that comes out when the passengers pay no attention to the cabin attendants. the highlight is when the attendant tells jimmie walker he'll have to put away his saxophone (god spare me from a flight seated in front of a saxophonist playing jazz!) prior to take-off. jimmie basically says, "nope." later in the flight, the sax is damaged during a barrel-roll and jimmie actually shows up on the next leg of the flight with yet another sax that he won't put away. this aspect of the film is just fun. (one passenger actually obeys the attendant. when charo is told she can't take her dog on the flight, she leaves the plane. naturally, this is because you can't get a good view of her ass and boobs while she's seated.) in summary, a terrible movie, but terrible enough to be a bit amusing. unfortunately, the filmmakers and cast deserve no credit whatsoever for this, as it was probably entirely unintentional.

my take: the silliest of the airport movies, and probably one of the worst of the 70's disaster movies.as if to milk the franchise with all its got, the producers of this third sequel to airport throws in more action, silly subplots, gratuitous star appearances and goofier elements. in its attempt to be the biggest airport yet, concorde: airport '79 is the worst one yet, and probably one of the worst of the disaster movies of the 1970's. with its bad box-office results, it is no wonder that the genre has overstayed its welcome.the film opens with a rather catchy score by lalo schifrin backed-up by some impressive shots of the titular aircraft in its former glory (the same plane used in this film would be involved in a crash in july 2000). but then the credits appear, and we get a glimpse of the "all-star" cast, which is composed nothing more of faded hollywood stars, tv actors and none-too-popular b actors. the plot is sillier than ever: george kennedy is back in the role of joe patroni, now the pilot of the concorde (co piloted by co-pilot alain delon) en route to france after the summer olympics. on board is reporter maggie whelan (susan blakely), who has just discovered that his boyfriend, renowned weapons manufacturer kevin harrison (robert wagner), is selling their weapons to terrorist. to prevent her from revealing the news to the world, harrison sends his most advance missiles and best saboteurs to prevent the concorde from landing.the cast/subplots are dumber than ever, even sillier than an alcoholic myrna loy or a singing nun. we have cicely tyson transporting a live human heart in a cooler (!), martha raye as a woman with a bladder condition (and the character doesn't go deeper than that), j.j. walker a a pot-smoking saxophonist (arguably the most annoying character in the film), eddie albert married to "old" wife sybil danning, avery schreiber as russian coach with a deaf daughter and finally, a love story between reporter jon davidson and gymnast andrea marcovici (much to the sour watching-eye of coach mercedes mccambidge). plus the movie gets much closer to love boat episode than ever with the silliest cameos of charo (and her pet chihuahua) and bibi anderson. camp buffs will no doubt get a real kick-in-the-balls in this silly entry in a long strain of 70's disaster movies. this one is, in more than the sense of the word, a true disaster.rating: *1/2 out of 5.

ok, so my summary line is a cheap trick. but the movie is full of them and it gets absurdly praised, so...i caught this one on tv (uncut, as tv here shows all movies, that's for you americans who might say i didn't like it because i saw a cut tv version - fortunately that's only an us thing), and had no idea about what it was. i switched on, caught the last minutes of a show, and the movie began. within a minute, i was begging it was a comedy, given the particularly ridiculous clichéd beginning (yes, it's a bad movie-within-the-movie, i know, but what a way to try to keep the viewer interested! i don't even know why i didn't switch channels). and, yes, in fact the movie turned out to be a comedy, albeit an unintentional one.marina zudina is pretty enough, but gosh, what a dreadful performance! while casting a foreigner in the role is smart enough (she doesn't talk so bye bye language barrier), yet, sorry, marina baby, playing mute doesn't mean impersonating harpo marx. her acting is unintentionally funny in many moments, just look at her when she draws an x in the air while stalked by the killer. he wants to kill you, it's no time to play zorro. we get plenty of "running upstairs" stuff passing for tension, as in the worst slashers, and things like pulling a carpet and a bad guy shots the other. ugh! will hollywood ever learn? yet the best/worst pearl is having a guy electrocuted in a bathtub and... well, i have never seen anyone being electrocuted to death in a bathtub, but i'm sure you can't see the blue cartoon rays in real life, do you? and how about immediately trusting a mean-looking guy because he says he's a cop, and not asking him to show you his credentials? ok, so he turns out to be a real cop. but still, not asking for the badge makes no sense (plot-wise, we could always think the credentials might be phony or he might be a crooked cop. screen writing 101). and how about the big twist? don't tell me you didn't see that coming from 200 miles away...i feel sorry for poor old alec guinness and his useless stock footage cameo. now i think about this, what's the point in giving him a "mystery guest star" credit... in the end titles? the movie's over, there's no mystery anymore, and everybody and their brother have identified guinness (even non-movie buffs will recognize "the old guy from 'star wars'"). yet better off this way, so we can pretend it's not the late great actor.people keep comparing this to, of all people, hitchcock. i suppose it has to be john hitchcock the milkman, as the late sir alfred would feel embarrassed out of watching this, let alone making it. and this gets a 6.8/10???? it's bottom 100 material! but then, we're talking a rating system that allows 'the lord of the rings: the return of the king' to appear as the third best movie ever made (check top 100), so...2/10.

i found this movie really hard to sit through, my attention kept wandering off the tv. as far as romantic movies go..this one is the worst i've seen. don't bother with it.

this film is about two female killers going on a tour to kill random men they meet.wow, "baise-moi" just became the worst film of all time in my list. the plot is crazy, pointless and unnecessary. the whole film is full of violence and sex, and i am sure no sane parents would want to show this film to their children. i don't understand what people get out of by making this film, or watching this film. maybe someone somewhere has their perverted desires fulfilled. there is simply no excuse or reasons for the existence of this perverted and depraved piece of work.the only consolation i offer myself is that i watched it on fast forward, so that i have not wasted as much time.

a movie about a french girl who gets raped by street hoodlums. the rape scene itself is shot in all it's gory detail with all the male and female organs and their interactions clearly visible to the camera. in a fit of rage, the victim grabs her friend's (or was it brother ?) gun, shoots him and runs off with the weapon. she meets this prostitute who has just seen her pimp shot down, they team up, and make off towards paris. a series of crazy, meaningless and wild killings follow, the girls seem to enjoy every murder more than the one before. one poor guy gets shot in the ****hole. there are good doses of sex thrown in between the numerous killings.the movie is not the most violent i have seen, i would say saving private ryan probably had more violence in it. if violence is what you are looking for, then there are lots of other movies out there. and if it's sex you are out for, then i would suggest one of those xxx ones.i went to see the movie because of all the hype the media was giving it. the movie itself is no big deal, just a lot of violence and sex shot with something like a hand-held camera. i was surprised this movie had a 15 year age limit in sweden, if 15 year-olds can watch this movie, they should be able to watch xxx movies too.

this is one of the rare movies that i did not immediately discuss with my friends after watching it. this wasn't because it had particularly entranced or impressed me. the contrary, it had given me nothing at all.why? because somehow, everything was so much overdone that i couldn't take this film seriously anymore. there was so much sex and violence that i got the strong impression that the film was trying very, very hard to be offensive, as if it was aiming at superlatives in ugliness, rather than in telling a convincing tale about two women caught in a spiral of crime.baise-moi had been described as "thelma & louise with actual sex" to me. well, it is true that the main idea is similar. there are two women traveling through the country because they've committed crimes and know that their lives are finished now, that the police are going to catch them, and they decide that now that everything's over anyway, there is no way to hold back.baise-moi had been described as a feminist film where women, who had suffered from male dominance in the past, exact revenge upon the men that they encounter.this is something that i had never interpreted into this film, simply because none of these women had ever been innocent, and because they do not just kill irresponsible, violent men, but also men that they seduce themselves, men that show the sense of wanting to do protected sex. and they kill women. no, they are in no way better than the characters that they encounter and murder in hideous, brutal ways.how easily the "heroines" decide to murder, and how much pleasure they take in it, made it absolutely impossible for me to relate to them in any way, or even take them seriously. it was just all too much. too much sex, too much violence. i got the feeling that sex and violence were only there in order to create a superlative in ugliness, rather than in conveying a story, or making a point.baise-moi left me with no impression, hadn't set me thinking, because it was so far removed from any real world. so constructed, unrealistic and over the top.there was nothing that i could do with this film, there was simply nothing about it to think about, other than "why did they make this terrible film?" had the intense unpleasantness going on in this film, served a purpose, i'd easily accepted it. but since i found nothing, since the film's story appeared to be not more than an excuse to squeeze as much and as ugly sex as possible into one film... i filed it away under "unnecessary torture", decided to never ever, ever, watch this film again, and i now consider this to be the worst film i've ever seen. worst, not just because it really isn't my cup of tea to watch people get raped, rape, have sex in other forms and kill one another... but because whatever it was that the makers wanted to tell the world with their film... if they wanted to say anything at all... it just didn't work. and there's nothing else that could save this film, because it's also filmed in such an ugly style.

i first saw a poster advertising this film on a street in helsinki, finland in june of 2000. what caught my attention was the proud proclamation advising all readers that the movie, although itself french, had been "banned in france". upon returning home to new york, i discovered that one of the "art house" movie theaters in the city was screening the film, and so (with my finnish fiancee) decided to see what all the fuss was about. boy, did we ever.from the comments read here, and the reviews i knew the movie was violent and sexually explicit. not necessarily offended by either of these two conditions, i went with an open mind to see what had perturbed the sensibilities of our gallic cousins. presumably, as anyone who is reading this will know, the story involves two women who embark on a crime and murder spree in france (the movie has english subtitles). the resemblance to "thelma and louise" however, ends with that; the sex is unusually graphic (and in copious supply) as is the violence (a lot of stomping to death, and a lot of blood and other organic matter splattering after bullet impact).on an intellectual level, one could make the case that the film's very essence is the relationship of sex and violence (as manifested by the only sex these women know: one is a small-time prostitute, and the other has earned money from time to time by performing in pornographic films. when they, during their descent into crime and murder, have the upper hand over their sexual situations, they react only with the same violence and brutality that they themselves know and understand. it is important to note, however, that the victims of their rampage are not only creepy men interested in creepy sex, (of which there are several)but innocent passersby, a woman at an atm, for example, as well.i myself do not really understand why the repeated "porn-movie" shots were all that necessary, (except to depict the physical contact as cruel, unpassionate and debased) and the unrelenting gore did get rather tedious after the first few violent spasms.it is a coarse and crude movie, but in fairness, it is dealing with coarse and crude people and equally unpleasant circumstances. from one point of view, the lives of the french underclasses is explored, and it's pretty grim; a travelogue for france it definitely is not- perhaps that's why the french banned it.

saimin (usa: the hypnotist /uk: hypnosis) aspect ratio: 1.85:1sound format: dolby stereo srfollowing a series of bizarre and apparently unrelated 'suicides', an experienced tokyo detective (ken utsui) enlists the help of a young psychoanalyst (goro inagaki) who believes the victims were acting on a post-hypnotic suggestion. but their subsequent investigations reveal an even darker force at work, linked to a young girl (miho kanno) whose life has been blighted by sadistic abuse...based on a novel by keisuke matsuoka, this densely-plotted mystery takes inspiration from a variety of sources (italian gialli, traditional japanese ghost stories, etc.), though some of the images in the climactic showdown reveal a more immediate influence: the recent commercial success of hideo nakata's ring (1998). for all its ambition, however, saimin is a routine potboiler which stumbles badly after a powerhouse opening (the 'suicides' are particularly impressive, despite some feeble cgi effects), though director masayuki ochiai - who co-wrote the script with yasushi fukuda - rallies proceedings for an extended finale in which the narrative's startling secrets are finally revealed. ochiai is best known for his film adaptation of novel-turned-video-game parasite eve (1997) - which also starred leading man inagaki (a member of japanese pop group smap) - and while saimin echoes that movie's strong visual sense, it falls short as drama, and most of the characters are mere ciphers, undermining the storyline's emotional pay-off. which is a shame, because the final half hour is galvanized by a series of dynamic set-pieces - most notably, a concert hall sequence in which dvorak's 'new world' symphony is transformed into an instrument of murder! - and ochiai is well-served by an excellent production team. however, those lured by the promise of gory carnage may be disappointed - the film is long on atmospherics and short on splatter.performances are varied, due to the script's limitations, but kanno (tomie) is outstanding as a young woman suffering from multiple personality disorder - which, the subtitles on the print under review assures us, isn't recognized as a viable medical condition in japan! - who falls prey to a sleazy tv hypnotist (takeshi masu), a prime suspect in the murders. inagaki is bland in a one-dimensional role, and he's constantly upstaged by utsui, a veteran performer whose career stretches back to the "sûpâ jaiantsu" series of the 1950's.(japanese dialogue)

leon errol handles his double role of uncle matt lindsay and lord basil epping superbly, but i have trouble liking the "mexican spitfire" series because they all are contrived to produce mistaken identities, and these are telegraphed way in advance. errol is funny as the stuffy lord epping, but i would have preferred a lot more wit and much less repetition. 

intended as light entertainment, this film is indeed successful as such during its first half, but then succumbs to a rapidly foundering script that drops it down. harry (judd nelson), a "reformed" burglar, and daphne (gina gershon), an aspiring actress, are employed as live window mannequins at a department store where one evening they are late in leaving and are locked within, whereupon they witness, from their less than protective glass observation point, an apparent homicide occurring on the street. the ostensible murderer, miles raymond (nick mancuso), a local sculptor, returns the following day to observe the mannequins since he realizes that they are the only possible witnesses to the prior night's violent event and, when one of the posing pair "flinches", the fun begins. daphne and harry report their observations at a local police station, but when the detective taking a crime report remembers harry's criminal background, he becomes cynical. there are a great many ways in which a film can become hackneyed, and this one manages to utilize most of them, including an obligatory slow motion bedroom scene of passion. a low budget affair shot in vancouver, even police procedural aspects are displayed by rote. the always capable gershon tries to make something of her role, but mancuso is incredibly histrionic, bizarrely so, as he attacks his lines with an obvious loose rein. although the film sags into nonsense, cinematographer glen macpherson prefers to not follow suit, as he sets up with camera and lighting some splendidly realised compositions that a viewer may focus upon while ignoring plot holes and witless dialogue. a well-crafted score, appropriately based upon the action, is contributed by hal beckett. the mentioned dialogue is initially somewhat fresh and delivered well in a bantering manner by nelson and gershon, but in a subsequent context of flawed continuity and logic, predictability takes over. the direction reflects a lack of original ideas or point of view, and post-production flaws set the work back farther than should be expected for a basic thriller.

the emperor's (richard haydn) dog is betrothed to johanna's (joan fontaine) dog. however, when virgil (bing crosby) arrives in town to sell a gramaphone record player to the emperor, his dog is attacked by johanna's dog. after a revenge attack where virgil is banished from town, a psychoanalyst insists that johanna's dog must confront virgil's dog so that she can overcome her doggy fears. this is arranged and the dogs fall in love. so do virgil and johanna. the rest of the film passes by with romance and at the end, johanna's dog gives birth. but who is the father.......? the dog story is the very weak vehicle that is used to try and create a story between humans. its a terrible storyline. there are 3 main musical pieces all of which are rubbish - bad songs and dreadful choreography. its just an extremely boring film - bing has too many words in each sentence and delivers them in an almost shouty, irritating manner. its not funny............ ever..........but its meant to be. bing and joan have done much better than this.

this is a movie about a black man buying a airline company and turning the company into a african-centric over the top airliner. they even portray the owner as not only being in control of the airline, but also controlling part of the air terminal at the airport. one day this guy wins $100 million dollars a the next time you see him, he is walking all over the airport acting like the owner of the airport. everyone calls this movie a parody, but nothing about this movie shouts parody! this movie is a flop and will forever be in the $4.95 bin at wal-mart.i can't even come to terms to why mgm would waste 16 million dollars on this movie. this movie doesn't even warrant straight-to-video status. the writers (one black and one white) should be blackballed from hollywood forever. not only do they over-stereotype blacks, they portray them as ignorant human beings. i would be ashamed of going to a movie that constantly humiliates me. don't waste your time at the video store, wal-mart, pay-per-view, or on a sunday afternoon when the movie is shown on tbs.

alright lets break it down. why is this one of the worst films ever? because there are so many answers to that question i'm having a headache. come on...cracker world? mr. honkee? the part with the arab guy? its just awful, i didn't really care about the whole white racism crap, but when they did that thing with the arab guy, i wanted to get the names of all the writers. its really not worth watching 3 seconds of this movie. it isn't even funny-bad which was my first interpretation. i hope the person who directed this movie doesn't commit suicide, but it seems likely, i don't see any other options.don't ever watch this movie, if you watch it, u cant say u died with no regrets.

i'll be honest-- the pimped out purple plane with snoop dogg at the helm is an amusing visual gag. it would have been a decent concept for a 30 second commercial, or maybe a 3 minute music video. but the producers have committed the age-old concept comedy sin of stretching 30 seconds of material into an hour and a half of film, and the results are predictably lame. the remainder of the 89 minutes are filled with the typical gamut of racist and sexist humor and fart jokes, offensive and-- worst of all-- painfully unfunny. the threadbare plot screams under the weight of its contrivances. best to be avoided unless you are drunk or stoned.

if you just watched all dogs go to heaven, and learn that there's a sequel, don't watch it. it's horrible. it's absolutely awful. they rush the characters to develop. sasha, for example, begins singing about how you can count her out for love. and at the end, this seems more like a dramatic romance flick than a comedy-adventure film. they rip charlie out of his character and replace him with a gushy, soft, but still rebellious version of himself.the humor behind carface's character is just completely lost. he's a totally different dog. he doesn't have a cool voice anymore, he isn't that villain you love to hate anymore, he's just a wimp voiced by none other than mermaid man from spongebob. speaking of voice actors..charlie has a completely different voice. and while it isn't horrible, i don't like it. it's terrible in comparison to the excellent job that burt reynolds did for the character in the first film. dom deluise is wonderful as always, as itchy. that character stays true, and that's why this film gets a 3/10. purely because dom deluise was still voicing itchy.oh, and my last complaint. i know ann-marie's movie was done and gone, she has parents now, etc, but did charlie completely forget about her, or what? no mention at all of her in the second film. i mean, even a small mention from itchy would have been acceptable. (ex. "charlie, we have to get back. you can't take care of every kid that needs rescuing.) or something of the sort. i mean, he died living with her, she deserves some kind of mention.don't watch this if you're looking for a wonderful sequel.

i think that this is a disappointing sequel. i miss a lot of the old characters (king gator, anne marie, etc.), and i don't like it due to the fact that not even half of the original voices are back to do the characters. a lot of personality was lost in charlie, and the villain red is not even half as bad as carface was in the first one. if you're a big adgth fan like i am, it's worth seeing just to see how the story is continued, but don't count on it being 5 stars in your book.

first, they ruin it with the uniquely bad animation quality, then, they get voices that sound nothing like the original. they make sooo many movie mistakes. when sasha is singing in count me out, the drummer disappears and then reappears, itchy's shirt keeps changing color, his hat keeps changing position, one of the bridge is white, everyone in the background appears fat, halos keep changing colors and appearing and disappearing. even heaven appears different. i don't give a damn if this is a low budget film, they shouldn't cut corners on animation. they completely ruined the first adgth. the only good thing about this movie was the soundtrack.

all dogs go to heaven was a quirky, funny movie; with good name talent who's voices lended an adult familiarity to a cartoon basicly for kids. it was just interesting enough to be likeable by adults aside from something good for the kids to watch.unfortunately adgth2 is a valueless sequel trying to make a bit of cash rideing on the coattails of the first. charlie sheen is a passable replacement for burt reynolds in this second movie and sheena easton's voice in a few of the movies lovely but forgettable songs makes her a worthwhile pick as a co-star for this. add dom deluise from the first movie and you'd think this would be a decent mix to make this sequel at least relatively decent compared to the first one.unfortunately even with the addition of other good voice actors such as bebe neuwirth in the horrible role of anabelle, this movie cannot be saved from the atrocious production values and animation skills (or lack thereof) present all over this movie. horrible editing, syncronization of the voices, and flat out spaces where characters mouths should be moving to dialouge but are not combine to make this movie look like a college interns animation project instead of the decent sequel it could have been.all in all i'd say unless you were a very big fan of the first movie i'd give this a very large pass.

how could they take such a beautifully animated gem like don bluth's all dogs go to heaven and bastardize it with a charmless, cheesy, uninspired sequel. the haunting music and delightful characters are gone, now replaced with tacky animation and an unimaginative plot.the pros: charlie sheen is sometimes fun as charlie, but he lacks the charming tough guy attitude that brought him to life by burt reynolds. i did particularly enjoy the songs "i will always be with you" and "it's too heavenly here".the cons: there seems to be no connection between this and the original. in the beginning charlie is chums with carface, but wait a minute. isn't this the same character who was responsible for charlie's murder and kidnapped the sweet little orphan he loved? i guess that all changes in heaven but why isn't anne-marie even mentioned? if itchy makes it to heaven, wouldn't flo and killer make it too? what is with annabelle the whippet's voice? in the original it sounded feminine and charming and in the sequel it sounds like a whiny, bitchy, parrot. the new characters aren't all that great (except sasha). and the animation is better compared to a generic saturday morning cartoon. the constant cartoony "humor" is flat and unfunny and the "heart" just doesn't work when compare to the original, which had such a moving unsubtle touch that makes me cry every time.all dogs go to heaven is one of my all-time favorite films. how don bluth allowed this sequel to be made is beyond me.bottom line: not all sequels go to heaven.

movies like these do not need sequels. part of the advantage of don bluth moving away from disney is that he didn't need to suffer their endless tirade of straight-to-video, poorly animated cash-in sequels. but apparently it was someone's brilliant idea to make a sequel to "all dogs go to heaven," so we get this.charlie sheen replaces burt and he's not really as good. most of the film is just a poor excuse for a sequel and it isn't nearly as dark, different or entertaining as the original.i feel sorry for future generations who are going to have to suffer endless sequels like this without ever knowing what it was like to have a time when hollywood didn't totally rely on successful films as a crutch to release banal crap.please, no more sequels to kids films that don't need 'em.

this movie is... horrible and wonderful at the same time. i first saw it when i was about 13 or 14 years old, so it has a great deal of nostalgic value for me. in this movie, cesar romero actually plays the character of octavio, the man who "discovered" santana. there are also two other actors, monte markham (plays sam, who is trying to save his daughter) and peter mark richman (plays the priest), who have large filmographies, and these are the only performances that are okay. the rest of the acting and the movie itself have all of the b-film qualities that some of us cherish.i recently spent 2 years trying to acquire a copy of this movie, and it is almost nonexistent. i am assuming that it was discontinued very shortly after its release. but i did eventually find a copy and paid a pretty penny to acquire it. if you happen to come upon judgement day in a video store (unmistakeable with a cheesy green "satan" on the cover), count yourself among the blessed who live near one of the few video stores that still has a working copy. a must see for those of you who like to laugh at cheesy attempts at a scary movie.

this movie is so stupid that i want my $2.99 back that i paid for!! first this movie starts off with a bunch of wooden actor geeks with fill in talent like they got picked off the street somewhere because the "real" actors either did not show up because of the laughable script or they just couldn't get anybody desperate enough to do this movie! the music in this movie is enough to put you to sleep, flute music made for faerie's dancing in the wilderness wouldn't even be good enough for this movie! and the guy dressed up as satan looks like he's all dressed up in a k-mart halloween special costume! there are no dead scenes except a few lame scenes. when i saw what the terrible killers looked like in those bath robes with nosferatu faces i just laughed! this is what the whole town is supposed to be running away from once a year! this movie is one of the worst demonic movies i have ever seen. avoid this one!

my first impresson of the saikano: live action movie trailer (viewable on youtube), was "wow, this could be perhaps one of the few better live-action anime adaptations."this time i was just wrong! simply put, the live-action saikano movie was a puzzle missing a number of pieces; put together just enough to get the vague image of it all.*story* the movies story vaguely follows the anime and manga, but the movies story is just the frame of a car, rather than a complete automobile. it seems that many parts of the story originally in the anime were left out, altered, or completely changed. in fact the ending is completely different from the manga or anime endings. characters especially; many left out or had a different feel. the connection between fuyumi and shuji is reduced to that of shuji knowing her because she's the video store lady. chise's character felt too strong already and only uttered the infamous i'm sorry a few times in the movie. same can be said with shuji. we lost the shy uptight yet tall male lead, the song he hums, and his frequent action of calling chise silly. other characters like tetsu and akemi had a different, toned down feel to them. perhaps the dropping and toning down of other characters was to focus a lot more on chise and shuji, which it did. way too much. expecting a lot of sweet action scenes like those in the trailer? well don't! those in the trailer plus a few minutes, is the only amount of action you will get. so much of the movie is talking that while i was browsing thru the movie before watching it all, i thought i had gotten a regular asian romance drama. pacing was way too fast. in the film, we see the famous scene of chise armed with small wings and a chain gun arm, in just a little less than nine minutes of beginning it. there is very little time to get to know the characters and connect with them. what they should have done was split it into two movies, or even a trilogy. if it had been not as many things would have to be changed or dropped.but again the movie behaves like a frame. the anime was more of a complete automobile because even if all those little details and such are minor they can really add up.*production*-visuals- visuals were disappointing. so much of the special effects turned out looking quite cheesy especially the cgi. sadly, they were like those found on sci-fi channel movies. they are bearable and this movie isn't for the effects.-music- music was average. much of it was orchestral background music except there were really no themes. the film has dropped the addicting song that shuji in the anime was always humming. a noticeable piece of music though is the ending song, heard in the trailer. not a bad and somewhat beautiful song. its a shame that it was not integrated into the movie as itself or an orchestrated version of the song.-casting- saikano's casting was also so-so. the main star was chises actor aki maeda, who is most famous for her role in the battle royale films. the actor that played shuji was pretty good but they took away the glasses from the original character. oh yeah and tetsuo looks like lupin the 3rd.unlike what i've heard from a few others, the acting in the live-action saikano was not that bad. i rather feel at fault is the way the story was laid out and cramming the series into just a two-hour film.*what can be learned from the live action saikano:*-cgi- i really wish the cgi in saikano hadn't been that bad. but even with just that, we could have gotten a few more fight scenes! probably the most anticipated live-action anime adaptation neon genesis evangelion most likely wont suffer since they currently have weta studios assigned to do the effects.-modernism- fuyumi owned a video shop. chise used a audio cassette player to listen to music and gave shuji a mix tape for his birthday. why? this movie is made in 2006! not only that in the movies reality they can create such a thing as chise so it cannot take place in the 90s! the future is an age of cds, dvds, and mp3 players. hopefully in evangelion, shinji will have a sony walkman mp3 player. not one that plays cassette tapes.-story & pacing- as mentioned earlier, the saikano movie moved too fast and forced the story to drop out many details. it was a smart move upon adv films and whoever else, to make evangelion into a solid trilogy thus allowing more time to retell the story as true to the original as possible.-characters- leave most of the character designs alone and let those classic quotes be said! what if the live action evangelion didn't have asuka's "what are you, stupid?!" or shinji's "i mustn't run away!" sometimes as small as they seem, those frequent quotes add and are who the characters are.*conclusion:*all in all, the live action saikano movie had potential. it really did. those you who aren't fans and see this movie: you will be reluctant to start the anime or manga (so don't watch the movie first!) people who saw and liked the anime/manga, don't get your hopes up on this one. studies show you most likely will be disappointed. it was still fun to see the anime come to life in the live action adaptation but it could have been so much more.reluctantly, i give the live-action saishu heiki kanojo (saikano) a 2 out of 5. as chise says, "i'm sorry" ~nekotakuto

where do i start? the plot of the movie, which is about a love between two high school students during wartime, while one is a living weapon, and their struggle to maintain that love is a very good plot. it is based on a manga by shin takahashi which was also turned into an anime in 2002, both of which i have yet to read or see.this review is about this live action adaptation however. sadly, this honest to goodness was a terrible movie. it isn't as if one could site certain aspects, and say, for instance, the budget is at fault, or the acting is to blame. it is, sadly, a series of underwhelming and ineffectual elements that bring this film down.the acting is poor. not to say aki maeda and shunsuke kubozuka are bad actors, but they didn't have much to work with, and seemed miscast. neither seemed to have the physical range to draw the viewer in the story as well as being too old for their parts to a distracting degree.the script was weak, the leads act unrealistically, and behave irrationally. the film also plays for the heartstrings, but ends up being predictable, all the while not being compelling, and under-developing the characters. there are also pacing issues.visually, it is unremarkable. the film uses green screen heavily and unnecessarily in too many scenes. the other special effects also have a cheap look to them, especially where minimalistic practical special effects could have been used. there is also no visual flair, as if there were no cinematographer or art designer to make the scenes look consistent and stimulating.the music and sound effects were fine, but unremarkable.overall, the movie isn't devoid of enjoyment, and fans of the series shouldn't be discouraged to see it at least once just for the sake of completion. people unfamiliar with saikano, this probably isn't the place to jump in as it isn't a very good movie or melodrama. it isn't the movie or the cast and crews fault, it just isn't inspired, and that is what kills it.

for a movie that was the most seen in its native south korea for most of 2004, it was a huge disappointment. shows that hollywood is not the only place where people can make over-emotional, melodramatic movies. the film was over 130 minutes long but not a lot actually happened and everything that happened was pretty much what one expected, the plot was that transparent. granted if one himself was korean, one would perhaps get into it more, but for me it didn't do much anything. suffice to say that as the case tends to be with korean cinema, the plot revolves around the relationship between the northern and southern parts of the peninsula. south korea decides to recruit and train an elite assassination squad from death-sentence prisoners to kill kim il-sung.a tedious plot doesn't bother me much if the characters are good but unfortunately that is not the case this time around either. they are stereotypes and most of the acting is mediocre and too often just over the top as it tends to be in korean cinema. too much time is spent on the numerous montages and the characters remain distant, one dimensional cardboard cuts. they should've spent more time establishing the characters and less showing us how tough and cruel the training and the soldiers are.one thing it does remind us of, is that a lesser of two wrongs is still wrong.

this was an absolute disgrace! the worst dramatisation i have ever seen. german officer's with a spotless english accent, they didn't even attempt to be german. how were we supposed to take them seriously? garbage garbage garbage! leave the german acting to the likes of ralph fiennes & liam neeson in future.

this is yet another pseudo-intellectual "let's make the nazis look real bad" movie. the nazis were pretty bad, no doubt - most of already know that. however, that does not necessarily make every movie on the theme good. a discovery channel presentation of "the wannsee conference" would have been much more interesting. "conspiracy" falls on its ass between two categories: documentary and drama. it doesn't cut it as a documentary, the movie is too "staged" and the presentation too "common". it doesn't cut it as a drama, the characters are too shallow and conflicts too easily "solved".another thing is the tagline: "one of the greatest crimes against humanity was perpetrated in just over an hour." as the movie shows the wannsee conference the meeting had nothing to do with reaching a consensus on the final solution. the decision on the solution had already been taken by the ss. the sole purpose of the meeting was to make all significant stakeholders commit themselves to an already established plan. there were no decisions or plans made at the wannsee conference. there was only threats and coercion (some needed less than others).finally: one thing the movie does show (although in no exceptional manner) is, man has a tendency to turn to culture and aesthetics in an attempt to hide for himself the fact that he is committing appalling atrocities. this is seen in most powermongering "leaders" and politicians.

this movie examines the now infamous wannsee conference where top nazis gathered to discuss the organisation and implementation of the "final solution" first off, i want to say i was amazed to see kenneth branagh play a nazi. with the slicked back blonde hair, he certainly looked the part but he didn't really act the part well. there was none of the menace & cruelty and in the end, he came out looking like a grinning cheerleader, keeping the meeting going. the real heydrich would not have let the conference get out of control the way it did in the film.the best performance of all was undoubtedly colin firth who played dr william stuckart, the man who wrote the 1935 nuremberg race laws and who gave "legal respectibility" to everything the nazis did. firth's performance was stunning, the main vocal opponent to what heydrich was proposing. the best part of all was when he was verbally dressing down one of the nazi thugs. the thug muttered "i'll remember you" and firth replies "you should! i'm very well-known!!" the film is historically accurate but let's boil it down to what it really is - 90 minutes of a group of men around a table discussing, shouting and bragging. there's no excitement, no real conflicts (except the brief argument). it's just 90 minutes of talking! same room, same table, same people.i'm not sure if the dvd is worth the money. i for one felt short-changed.

**maybe spoilers** **hard to spoil this thing more then it is, but just in case** gee's i don't see how anybody could have liked this re-make!! it was like a "made for t.v" show and still pretty lame for that. lots of fake snow, bad acting by top stars, bad action and that crazy pine forest in detroit. what the heck??!! i didn't really think this would be a great movie but i was hoping to be entertained. nope, we fell asleep half way and had to finish it up the next day. i could have skipped the rest easy(but then i would have missed those great piney woods!) i'm so glad i missed this at the theater! bad enough to have wasted $3.50 at the video store. and i am a lover of cop, action and drama films. this was a very stinky 1 out of 10 stars. give me the original any day!!

i was looking for attack on precinct 13. there, the film is that memorable. who is the star of this? ethan hawke or matt dillon (i can't tell who the lead actor is, that's a pretty big point against the movie right there) gabriel byrne (who could't have needed the money this badly could he?) drea de matteo is stunning but only because of her amazing body. it took me ages to finally work out she's joey's sister off "friends". i agree that the so called swat people attacking the station are pretty crap, as far as tactics go. we were even taught better basic skills than this in raf basic training.avoid this, even the snow doesn't want to fall on a bus full of prisoners! very bad continuity indeed.avoid like the plague!

ok, here is the deal. i love action movies and generally have no problem suspending a great deal of disbelief over plot holes or other implausible actions. however, this movie went far beyond minor flaws and went straight to the ridiculous. let me get this straight. the police send a notorious gangster and cop killer (along with a number of other prisoners) on a bus with a grand total of two guards. they then are forced to stop at a precinct where precisely two cops are working, one of which is a day away from retirement and the other is a burn out. apparently the building was about to be shut down so somehow the police decided that everyone else in the entire precinct got the night off for new year's eve. right. but wait, it gets better. gabriel byrne shows up to take out fishburne before he can rat him and other dirty cops out. (although we never find out anything about their relationship or dealings). interestingly, the cops launching the assault on the precinct are in full swat gear with night vision goggles, assault rifles, the whole nine yards. later on they even bring in a helicopter with more people in full gear. i'm not a cop, but i'm pretty sure you can't just waltz out of the station with an entire swat platoon worth of equipment without someone asking what you are doing. and the police helicopter??? in the supposedly terrible winter storm??? also, no one near the precinct happens to hear or see this major siege going on with flash grenades and heavy rifle fire going off? i mean seriously, come on. i know this is set in detroit, but even there it would raise suspicion on a supposedly top secret mission. i also love the fact that they find a tommy gun in the evidence room and somehow the gun still works and has bullets that are still intact and usable.i could live with some of these problems if there weren't other glaring issues also. for one, the opening couple minutes of the movie are shot nicely in a very frenetic and hyperactive way and i thought was going to set the tone for the rest of the movie. unfortunately i was wrong. the remainder of the film has no sense of pacing or tension or drama. the "characters" don't relate to each other in any way which is probably largely due to the fact that they aren't particularly interesting. there isn't enough interesting action to make this a good action movie, and there isn't enough character development/storytelling to make this a passable thriller/drama. the "relationship" between hawke/fishburn is the only thing that the director even tries to make interesting or intense. oh and by the way, the final scene in the wilderness? uh, i thought this was in the middle of a run down industrial section of detroit and suddenly we are in the woods?? the acting isn't terrible in this movie, it is just that the directing and writing are atrocious. i really enjoy some of hawkes, fishburne, byrne, dennehy's other movies but this one is terrible.

you expect it to be juvenile but you at least expect a complete and coherent movie. what a waste. i am extremely disappointed, not at just having watched a bad movie, but at having such a great concept be tainted by a common movie that we've all seen before. if this crud makes $1 over its budget, the studio would be wise to declare victory, round up all available copies, store them deep within the nuclear waste repository under yucca mountain, and then never make another movie like it again. most of this movie will keep you thinking, "this is not what i wanted to see." this film appeals to the unintelligent and maybe to teenagers. it's a true shame because most movies are made for that demographic. i had much higher hopes for this film.

this movie features a pretty decent fx sequence of an earthquake for 1936. the reason you haven't seen it, is because audiences in the 30s were enamored of the "jeanette macdonald picture;" in which the eponymous star warbled her way through countless songs, while plots came to a complete standstill. the fx cross time very well. macdonald's songs do not, and the awkward insertion of said songs to show off her only typical talent is not good. the hoary device of two friends growing up to become a priest and a hoodlum is given another run through the machinery (manhattan melodrama, the departed). at the 30 minute mark, you've already heard the song 'san francisco' three times. entertainment in the thirties is generally an accumulation of irritation. only grand hotel from the decade foregoes annoyance to the degree shown in san francisco, dinner at 8, little caesar, stagecoach, all quiet on the western front, les miserables etc..

"san francisco, oh you marvelously desolated town, thank you, god, for destroying it, and making bricks fall on our collective heads, and for pummeling into oblivion tens of thousands of your innocent, obedient sheep, oh lord, who art so merciful in thy heavenly ways..." these should have been the lyrics to the title song of this oh-so inspiring and utterly mindless film.the movie starts well enough, with gable discovering a cinderella with a highly annoying but much-appreciated operatic voice, and she soon shoots to stardom. one of the many problems with our cinderella is that she is played by jeanette macdonald, who, if one "takes the time" to look through all that make-up and 30s glitz facade, realizes that she is kind of ugly. too ugly to be playing this role, anyway. yet gable and everyone else fawn all over here as if she were some damn beauty or something. another problem with cinderella is that her character is so utterly humble, wholesome, innocent, god-loving, kind, and generous - enough to make you vomit for a full hour. macdonald plays her (admittedly one-dimensional) role with the sort of "ahhh", "oh", and "ooh" that serves to annoy rather than make her sympathetic.tracy has been better, and had better roles, than playing this clichéd, heart-of-gold, god-loving, non-child-molesting priest (who boxes in his "free time" - as if priests have anything to do - how cute). even the ever-reliable gable is not up to his usual standard; he is far too animated, and his character is far too selfless for someone who is supposed to be an ambitious western "scoundrel" (though this, obviously, is the script's fault).the plot is basically this: gable and his rival holt play ping-pong with cinderella - using her as the ball. how? well, first she is working (singing) for gable, then she works for the square holt, then she goes back to gable, only to return very soon to holt. (and, of course, both want to have her as girlfriend/wife.) and if the earthquake hadn't interrupted this table-tennis plot, it's a safe bet that she would have been bouncing back-and-forth another ten times, the wishy-washy little princess that she is.there are many, far too many in fact, musical numbers. it's almost as though they tried to make the first "disaster-movie musical" ever. how silly. the stuff she sings in gable's "joint" is okay, but when she starts belting out those high-pitched, annoying whines during the opera segments, that is when i felt that my ears were unprovokingly and unjustly attacked by enemy sound-fire. in fact, there is an opera number that lasts 6 damn minutes. 6 may seem like little, for those who haven't had first-hand vietoperanam experience with such horrors of audio torture, but it's like with dog years; a dog's year is equivalent to seven human ones. a minute of opera is equivalent to 100 minutes of chinese torture (or a dog urinating acid on your leg).i thought this was a disaster movie, but it's more like a near-disaster movie. (i read that some of the dialog in this film was written by a silent-era film director. jesus...) the melodramatic, and only occasionally amusing, proceedings get interrupted by the real star of this movie (namely, the earthquake), only after well over one-and-a-half hours. when joe the earthquake finally does shake up the city, and our clichéd characters in it, i almost felt like saying "thank god, death and destruction are finally here!". unfortunately, joe comes too late into the movie to save it from its increasing mediocrity; the scenes of devastation are very good, but even the earthquake part of the movie gets ruined (pun) by a highly annoying, religious ending. you see, gable, who professes to be an atheist all along (without actually using the word itself), finally finds macdonald alive - after having searched for days - and suddenly he is converted into a believer because cinderella is alive?!! how stupid! all that tells me is that gable's character is a weak-minded moron.the movie ends on a very dumb note, indeed. gable, having said "thank you" to god for "saving" his girl (and he does his on his knees) "finds" god (sees the light), and the movie's little old devil gable converts himself into a believer. how very god-fearingly american an ending...of course, no one thought of asking this "god" why the hell there was an earthquake in the first place! the sad and unintentional irony is that gable in the end becomes a "sucker"; all along he had made fun of "suckers" who fall for the holiest scam of them all - namely religion - and in the end he himself becomes one. now that's what i call a triumph of the human spirit! another irony is that the ending was supposed to have improved gable as a person, but i see it quite differently; on the contrary: it took only one big joe to turn gable into a god-fearing, meek, little, obedient believer - who joins the world's sheep family. and as if this intellectual downfall of gable's wasn't pathetic and disappointing enough, this first-ever "earthquake musical" ends with a truly hair-raising (take this word as you will), noble, and hope-inspiringly beautiful mass-choir scene: dozens (or hundreds) of earthquake survivors and proud, proud citizens of frisco spontaneously (or did "god" perhaps arrange it?) sing all together the title song in hope for a better, brighter, joe-less future. hallelujah! if you are a "sucker" for hollywood sentimentality, do not skip this movie.

i must say, i found this movie very disappointing. yes, i know maltin gave it 3 1/2 and others think very highly of it. but, well, the opera sequences were god-awful. i take it jeannete macdonald is an acquired taste. yes, in the short sequences i have seen her with nelson eddy, she is immensely preferable to him. but on her own...god, i dislike opera and despise operetta, and she is basically intolerable. at one point i had to cover my ears. gable is just ok, and tracy is thrown away. the plot is annoying in the jm never simply tells gable she loves him and the opera and why can't she do both? instead she suffers silently (or not so) with the compromises she makes. the supporting cast is distinctly unmemorable. besides the star three and jack holt (and i suppose his mother), they all are just background and forgettable. the eq sequence is the only thing that saves the movie. and just. yes, it is fairly spectacular and moving. but the "oh god is great" seems very contrived. i immensely prefer "in old chicago" as far as old time disaster spectaculars go. spare yourself on this one.

there is somewhere in here the makings of a decent if routine sf story. it is thwarted by several factors. first, the actor is just awful. even the competent actors are awful. the dialog is wooden and stilted. the plot plods along predictably. this seems less like a finished movie than actors going through a walk through. extremely disappointing.

where to begin.... this hideous excuse for a motion picture makes "plan 9 from outer space" look well thought out. the music? it's culled from every single overwrought piece of pd shlock in existence. the focus? hell, doesn't matter if in one shot there are thirty people standing in the road; the new angle shows a lone packard with a waitress posing for argosy mag shots. paul le mat, diana scarwid, louise fletcher, wallace shawn: fine actors who must have all been starving to death at that point in their lives and the director lured them to sign on with tempting bits of cat food. the production budget must have skyrocketed to well over fifty cents with the addition of the space alien phallic transportation machine which, for a time, must have meant that the oscar meyer wiener mobile was not available. when bad movies happen to good actors

i love movies, all genres, and from big dollar spectacles to small indie projects. but even making allowance for this piece of junk being 25 years old and its attempt at homage to the 1950's it just suffers in almost aspect, by which we judge films.throughout the movie, i was reminded of several "student films," i've had a chance to watch, efforts where creativity is required to fill gaps where funds are needed. all in all, chances are there are much better uses for 90 minutes of your life.2/10

maybe it gets better. i wouldn't know. i made it through the first twenty minutes or so before cutting it off and entering a period of mourning. it was obvious that the plot itself was a familiar one. a man, paul lematt, a professor of entymology at columbia, drives with his dog to a small town in ohio in search of his ex wife, diana scarwid. there he encounters people who either ignore him or are hostile. oh, they may smile but there's something going on underneath.that sort of arrangement is home turf for movie makers and viewers alike, and it's pregnant with possibilities. you can turn out a neatly drawn commercial success like "bad day at black rock." or it would have made, and probably did make, a nice "twilight zone" episode.the cast includes some seasoned performers too, as well as some formerly prominent names. kenneth toby, a veteran of science fiction, is the superficially amiable motel manager. diana scarwid can give an impressive performance, as she did in, say, "silkwood." for some of the others, their range is limited.but it's poorly directed and shabbily written.example of shabby direction. that dog of lematt's is disliked by kenneth toby, right off the bat. so when lematt walks out to the street, toby sneaks up to the window of his room, peers in at the dog, and something zaps. cut to lematt in the street. he hears his dog howling away. then a pov shot of presumably the dog zipping along towards lematt then past him while the wind blows and lematt gawks at the camera. cut to an identical shot -- coming from the other direction! whatever the camera represents, whatever lematt is staring at, is never shown. maybe it was nothing, because suddenly the wind stops and lematt is alone in the street, looking a little bit puzzled. "you should never have brought that dog in the first place," remarks a smiling toby from the porch. question: what the hell is that scene all about? example of shabby writing. well, two examples. (1) if you were to sit down and write a stereotypical waitress in a small-town diner, without the exercise of any craft whatever, you'd come up with an expressionless babe with her hair piled on top of her head, chewing gum, sauntering among the tables. right. (2) anything resembling believability is thrown out the window in favor of special effects. lematt's car chugs to a halt, then explodes while it is waiting to be fixed at the garage. chugging to a halt: believable. exploding: supernatural. not even edgar allan poe would endorse such an event.and the invaders themselves? think of a modest masterpiece like "invasion of the body snatchers." something is going wrong in dr. kevin mccarthy's small town, and it takes half the movie for the mystery to be unraveled, and all the time suspense is building and doubt is growing. here, twenty minutes into the movie, a stranger walks into a motel room and tears off his plastic face, revealing a pulsing, light-emitting, naked brain. the pregnancy is aborted.i won't tell you the ending because i don't know what it is, nor do i care. i suppose it had something to do with insects because why else would paul lematt be an entymologist? (by the way, who's handling his classes?) but i'm not even sure bugs were involved. it's entirely possible that the bug business was adventitious. the writers may have made him a specialist in insects and then forgot all about it. it wouldn't surprise me.

well, i only caught the tail end of this film on hbo, just the final 10 minutes or so, but i must say that it contains probably the most laughable depiction of distance running ever put on film! i'm a serious distance runner and a dedicated fan of the sport, and i've sat through many painful demonstrations in movies before. however, nothing could have ever prepared me for what is shown on screen in the final 10 minutes of this movie, it literally defies belief! the depiction of the runners is even more ironic considering that african runners completely dominate the sport, and they are elegant and graceful. the female protagonist shuffles along like an overweight pregnant woman, and her "highly trained" male supporters are no better. well into the race this alleged world class runner is surrounded by pudgy, overweight people, many of whom are walking! i find it interesting that the director decided to have her lead the female competition, yet near the end she is shown passing people who look like they're staggering along on two broken legs! are we to believe that this amazing stellar athlete has only overtaken a crippled person at the very end of the race? maybe the director just thinks that female runners can't run faster than 12 minute miles, and he has obviously never heard of athletes like paula radcliffe or tirunesh dibaba.even if you aren't a running fan you'll be astonished by the insanely inaccurate portrayal of running, and this movie is only watchable as unintentional comedy. here is a note to the director: the next time you decide to make a movie about a sport, it might be worth it to hire at least one person who actually has observed that sport in action.

it's hard to make a bad movie with the "underdog finally succeeds" sport theme, but this movie succeeds admirably. my mind boggles at how pointless and boring this film is.i guess the director couldn't decide whether this was about the runner or the coach. it ends up being about neither. ultimately, who cares? neither character has a likable personality. there is nothing in the movie to make you care about anyone. even the "bad guy" isn't really bad. (i think he's in two scenes, and seemingly is on some kind of barbituate. ) i think he asks her, once and politely, to leave the coach and train with him. then later he kinda' sorta' asks her to move in with him. that's it. conflict! tension! what will she do? !!-and what's with the depiction of running? has the director ever seen an actual marathon? christine's form is so incorrect it's absurd, as is the form of the supposed "champion" she competes with (a character with no lines. -maybe they could have hired, you know, an actual runner?)-and the speed the run at is beyond comprehension. were they running or speed walking? it's actually laughable. i can literally walk backwards faster then they were running in the big race. maybe it was too hard to move the cameras at real speed?another absurdity: (spoiler, i guess) at one point in the big race, the two women in the lead inexplicably fall, at the same time. what they fell on is a mystery. maybe they both just got exhausted and fell down? -and then they get up, but don't start running again for maybe 30 seconds. oh yeah, very realistic. this ridiculous event doesn't even add any tension, since the other runners are not close, and besides at this point you have been numbed into a state of catatonia.-i especially enjoyed how all four of her male teammates, highly trained athletes all, drop out of the big race due to charlie-horses, or pulled tendons, or something just as improbable. but who cares? this movie has almost no tension, no resolution, nothing. some woman runner with absolutely no personality is discovered by an old, boring coach with some past failure that is barely hinted at. they train a lot. she is not happy. they train some more. she wins da big race. woopie. my description is actually more interesting than the actual movie. i just saved you 90 minutes. avoid this one like the plague.

this is a movie which reminds me of avatar- starring rajesh khanna from the 80's. the issue of parents-kids divide is interesting but was handled in a rather unoriginal manner.. the characters were not developed fully and the kids seemed to go from being extermely loving ( in the first 15mts of the movie) to being totally unconcerned about the parents,, this transformation was not credible to say the least..they sld have explored this a little more. amitabh and jaya were miscast as this helpless old couple.. firstly amit was not too convincing in this role,because he just did not look like he should be helpless, i mean why not just go back to work where he is wanted instead of being w/ kids who didnt want them.. hema was not convincing as a 60 yr old either... she didnt look a day over 50.. then the whole isssue of the book baghban winning the booker prize begged credibility.. all in all, a movie that handles an important issue but cld have been made better, i give it 5/10

watching "baghban" is the movie equivalent of trying to eat one's way out of a vat of saltwater taffy for nigh unto three hours. this indian film is a sticky sweet, sentimental soap opera that starts off like "king lear," moves on to "romeo and juliet" in the middle section, then heads back again to "king lear" for its tear-soaked finale.raj malhotra is a bank accountant who seems to have everything a man could possibly want out of life: a wife who adores him, a family who loves him, and a job from which he is about to retire after a lifetime of faithful service. even though raj and his wife, pooja, have been married for 40 years and have four grown sons, they still act like a couple of love struck newlyweds, cooing and sighing, batting their eyes at one another and whispering sweet nothings into each other's ears almost to the point of nausea. in fact, the whole bloody brood is so happy, loving and harmonious that they make the von trapps look like a dysfunctional family in comparison. the parents and children joke together, laugh together, even perform elaborately choreographed, "spontaneous" song-and-dance numbers together (like many bollywood productions, "baghban" is a drama interspersed with a great number - in this case, far too great a number - of musical sequences).anyone who knows anything at all about storytelling is aware that such unadulterated bliss can not be allowed to go unpunished for long, and that all that joy is merely the prelude to some awful catastrophe destined to come crashing down on the heads of our unsuspecting revelers. knowing this, we spend the first hour of the film in fearful expectation, wondering just what form that disaster will take when it does finally arrive. the thunderclap occurs about an hour into the film, when raj announces to his children that he and their mother have decided to move in with one of their families, leaving the choice of which one it will be up to the kids and their respective spouses. suddenly, like king lear discovering the vipers hidden in the familial bosom, raj finds out that his children are not quite as loving, selfless and eager to share their homes and lives with their parents as he had originally thought. understandably horrified at the prospect, the kids, in order to foil their parents' plan, come up with a scheme in which raj will go live with one of their children, while pooja will live with another; then they will switch off until, eventually, each of the children has had a chance to host both parents and then the cycle will repeat itself ad infinitum. much to the chagrin of the kids, the parents accede to the plan, even though the two are deeply in love with one another and have never spent any time apart. thus, the second and most of the third hour are spent with the two aging (albeit married) lovers pining away for one another, while their ungrateful, insensitive little brats do everything in their power to make their parents understand how unwelcome they are in their homes.one of the major problems with "baghban" is that it lacks subtlety in both its storytelling and direction. the love that ray and pooja feel for one another, as well as the almost giddy closeness of the family unit, is laid on so thickly in the first hour that the film almost collapses under the weight of the sentimentality. then, virtually without any warning, the screenplay turns on a dime and converts the kids into callous, self-centered monsters and the parents into passive, whiny victims of that callousness. raj and pooja are a little too long in the tooth and a little too self-reliant to be doing the dreamy-eyed, pouting, unrequited love bit, more appropriate to lovelorn school kids than the parents of four grown children. the purple prose style, in which every emotion is underlined and highlighted, leads to intense overacting and a heavy reliance on corny reaction shots and melodramatic music for punctuation. the musical numbers convey a certain liberating joy in the beginning, but they go on for so long and turn up so frequently that they quickly lose their effectiveness and serve only to pad out the material to unendurable proportions. at least a full hour could be excised from this bloated production with no discernible harm being done - and quite a bit of good. there really is no reason why this film needs to drag on for a punishing three hours. most egregious of all is the seemingly endless harangue we are subjected to an the end, a speech in which raj (who has somehow managed to turn his experiences into an award-winning bestseller) lectures us all on the verities of parent/child relationships for ten straight minutes at the very least."baghban" is a sappy, corny saga, filled with more sugar and goo than a king-sized box of see's chocolates. sample at your own risk.

this movie truly shows the farce and hypocrisy of indian society. what it tries to show you is only one side of the story. the other side of the story is the hidden emotional and mental abuse of indian children which this movie does not show."indian parents" are culpable for the following: a. destroying the individuality of the children by making them completely dependent on the parents at a very early age. such children grow up to be adults only in physical looks but remain children in minds. since everything has been provided to them by their great indian parents, they children automatically do not feel the need to work hard at something or learn the basics of human communication with other human beings apart from their parents.b. i can show you so many indian parents who try to prevent their kids making friends, going out or prevent them to do anything which starts making them to grow into adults.the reason why they do is the same selfishness. indian parents "expect" their children to take care of them when they grow old. they do no savings for themselves and once they reach the age of 50...they cry out loud......we have grown old now and so we are dependent on you children since we have done the great service of bringing you to this world and taking care of you and making you intellectually weak.most of the indian parents at the age of 50 have dilapidated bodies and health and are financially completely insecure. most feel that they absolutely have no need to take care of themselves since they "expect" their kids to take care of them.in the west the opposite of that happens. people start planning at the age of 20 about their retirement and once they retire they are financially secure.indian parents do nothing of that sort since like i said they have brought the kids in the world and what better investment at that?.i am a victim of my indian parents (i am sure there are countless other indian kids like me), who have grown up physically but are still struggling with their lives on their own and they continue to have pestering 50 year olds who cry out loud for help all the time.this movie shows only one side of the story.....utter piece of junk

two days ago i got a chance to watch this movie on cable (tv-asia). i have been very disturbed since then. the movie "baghban" has been very successful in portraying only one side of the real life. it is highly partial towards parents. have you ever thought of other side (kids)?? there are few parents in this world who just give birth to their kids but don't give right parental care. i am a victim of that. why do you (parents) want to have 5 kids in your life if you are merely making only rs 2000 per month? i was made to work on streets along with my siblings. i have no idea how i managed to reach iit from there. it has been a long time since then but still i don't believe. now i am a research scientist here in usa. i have provided all the necessities to my parents along with care by my two brothers who stay along with them. they could not provide basic things to us when we were kids. i find this movie very resentful. its very partial. it has hurt my sentiments very deeply. i strongly urge the producer/director of this movie to look at the indian society in other point of view also and make another movie. i can be reached at john_simension@yahoo.com

ravi chopra wrote this film 40 years back, wanted to cast dilip kumar in the leadthe film finally was re-written and made in 2003 and hence the subject looks dated and too superficial at timeslike the reason amitabh-hema separate is too superficial even the way the youth are shown is too bad like gulshan in avtaarthe message though comes well but things are presented in a clichéd manner salman's character is the worst, looks straight out of a storybook while the climax speech of bachchan is good and also the final of not forgiving the sons is goodravi chopra does a good job music is decent, the songs sung by bachchan stand outamitabh excels like always, he has played an elder stern father earlier but here he plays a victim and portrays it well his last speech is great hema is good in her part aman verma stands out samir soni is okay, naseer and the rest sons and wives are decent though divya dutta stands out salman khan is fake, mahima is okay paresh and lillete are lovable

i used to always love the bill because of its great script and characters, but lately i feel as though it has turned into an emotional type of soap. if you look at promotional pictures/posters of the bill now you will see either two of the officers hugging/kissing or something to do with friendships whereas promotional pictures of the bill a long time ago would have shown something to do with crime. this proves that it has changed a lot from being an absolutely amazing police drama to an average type of television soap. when i watch it i feel like i'm watching a police version of coronation street or something similar. i have to say i still like the bill as i'm interested in police work and that type of thing but i really miss the greatness that the bill used to have. i want to rate it as 2 out of ten because you have to admit it has been totally ruined by the people who took the bill over.as for the script and characters they have both gone downhill, most of the great characters are gone now (although a few still remain i think) and i'm not saying that the newer characters are poor or anything because they definitely aren't, its just that they lack the tough looks, personalities and script lines that all of the old characters used to have because most of the new ones are at the moment involved with silly relationships and family trouble.overall being one of the only police programs on television these days, the bill will always be a crappily interesting thing to watch, but like i say it has lost a lot of its uniqueness (if thats the right spelling) and would now be classed as a terrible, unreal television soap.recommended to watch for a good laugh over the stupidity of the police officers involved - 2/10

ok, here's the short of it... this movie is full of corny dialogue, over the top acting, and a threadbare script.there are moments that intended to be very dramatic but simply come off humorous because of the over the top acting and poorly written lines. i couldn't help laughing at moments that were meant to be very serious. the bright spot in this movie is the circus. seeing the circus in its heyday was certainly a treat.there are moments that come through as good. but then it nosedives right back into b-movie territory. i was tempted to stop watching it several times.i certainly don't know how it won best picture, however. it must have been a slow year!

in a year when "singin' in the rain" and "high noon" were released, this overstuffed turkey somehow won the oscar for best picture. half the film is nothing more than circus performances. the other half is soap opera and melodrama. heston and wilde both overact, although they are models of restraint compared to the annoying hutton. playing a self-centered trapeze artist, hutton acts like an overzealous high school student in a badly produced school play. grahame is the only cast member to turn in a decent performance. demille has no interest in telling a good story, only in creating an overlong spectacle, not matter how dull.

this may not be the worst movie to ever win best picture but its up there. well on second thought this is probably the worst film to ever win best picture. still though you would expect it to be a worth while film. that in fact though if questionable as well. the film contains almost no depth and is just "fun" after "fun" if you want to call it that. at first its very interesting but it seems as if everything is exaggerated on so many levels.the acting was not spectacular to watch but it was quite interesting seeing charlton heston in his first lead role. i found many of the characters like the tone of the movie annoying after awhile. who i did like a lot was james stewart as the philosophical clown. he to me saved the film in that he gave it a much needed extra layer. sadly though after stewart there was not much else.the directing of the much respected cecil demille was non existent to me. i found the movie corny at times and his use of betty hutton was a mistake. the look of the movie was very good at times but it did not generate that magical feeling that classics need to have. the writing was actually pretty good considering how shallow much of the movie was.from movies like this did the term "hollywood trash" come up. there is no depth, no valid attempt at drawing emotions out of the audience and simply no artistic value to the film. then of course the many holes in the plot throughout. this movie was consistently annoying and frustrating. i even had a sense through this film that much of what i was watching was not only and inaccurate depiction of circus life but instead the opposite of how it really is. why this won best picture is beyond me but its not like the first or the last time the oscars will and have made a mistake.

i don't mind some adult humor, but this feature was just downright dirty. the first 10 minutes consisted of pryor swearing at some guy taking pictures, followed my even more profanities. i don't know what happened between that time the the last 5 minutes because i walked out. after seeing this i never looked at richard pryor the same way again. and to think that he actually went on to host a childrens' show.if profanity and tasteless, unfunny dirty jokes make you laugh, then you'll probably enjoy this. but if you're an "old-fashioned" type, then don't bother.

what you need in the run up to 'what you need', every episode since 'the lonely' had been a winner to some extent. this episode is the first major failure since 'escape clause'. the serling script is again based on someone else's materiel, a short story by lewis padgett. as with 'and when the sky was opened', serling altered the content significantly, removing a scientist and his machine and inserting an elderly peddler.'what you need' works best when it is being sweet. the opening half, in which the peddler provides customers in a bar with objects they will need in the near future, has a gentle charm about it that may have worn thin throughout an entire episode but works well in the time frame it is allotted. sadly, the main plot which it sets up is full of gaping holes. the minute steve cochran's performance as a two-bit thug becomes the main focus the episode falls apart. cochran's part is an underwritten stereotype and his flat performance highlights this flaw. his exploitation of the old peddler is dull and predictable and the revelation that he will murder the old man is totally unconvincing, making the whole slippery shoes scene seem completely false. ernest truex is good as the peddler, bringing a magical, mysterious but warm edge to the character, but he's not good enough to help the floundering script.to make matters worse, the weak script is also full of inconsistencies. for instance, we learn that the peddler's power to provide people with what they need stems from an ability to see into the future. so how exactly does this allow him to produce a pen that will magically pick winning horses. that seems like it should be a little outside his realms of power. also, for a man who can see the future, the peddler certainly acts surprised to find the thug waiting for him in his flat. there are many more holes that can be picked in 'what you need' but it's hardly worth it when the episode is so thin that you can see through it anyway.

i guess this is in the public domain as its out on dvd. first off, this is a feel good propaganda movie to be shown to a wartime aussie audience, so its not to be considered a serious retelling of tobruk. the first half to 3/4 is very dry stuff set in australia, i guess like many american war films where the recruits are getting together, oh man its soooo long. than we get to africa and tobruk, pretty bad, low budget stuff. the battle scenes on the dvd copy i watched were almost completely black. see it if you must, but be prepared to use the fast forward as i doubt you can take it after a few minutes. i enjoyed the cheesy italian "battle of el alamien" a whole lot more, also richard burton did an african theater war flick that was good "the desert rats", this movie is just a real period piece and should have stayed in that time, does not hold up well today (i doubt it was highly regarded back then either). i say the same thing about my american counterpart war flicks so don't take it personally aussies (i love australia, been there twice!).

red spectaclesi loved avalon, i think this director has made some awesome demented visions of the future. this film however was boring pretentious crap. the opening scene showed great promise for what the cover art and description promise a surreal live action amimae style future noir. i feel i got that with avalon.with red spectacles i was only driven to feel a uncomfortable to desire to what the hell the point was. the film barely made sense to me and i could not care less about the people in it. this would all be ok if the film was effective art. while the opening scene looked interesting and the scene with the giant robot-suit person holding the giant machine gun in the rain looked cool, it did not watch the film worth watching.thumbs down.

after watching avalon (which was decent only because of the very nice digital fx), and several anime films written by oshii, including jin-roh (which is fantastic) i decided i should check out the oshii cinema trilogy box set. being that the red spectacles and stray dog are related, i will comment here on both. and let me tell you, it was one of the biggest wastes of money i have spent in a while. i first watched stray dogs and then the red spectacles. i am sad to say that these films are quite possibly the most boring two movies i have ever seen. for only about 10 minutes in each film do you get to see some action between the the characters, who are only dressed in the "panzer cop" outfits for a few fleeting scenes. the rest of the time you will see some very drawn out scenes filled with boring dialogue in some less than impressive locations. i really don't understand the motivation behind these two films at all. i love the wolf brigade outfits and the idea behind the plot, but the films themselves leave much to be desired. i would suggest not watching these films, and certainly do not buy the box set like i did, unless you enjoy wasting money. oh, and if you are wondering what i think about the 3rd movie in the set, talking head, i couldn't even bring myself to watch it before i purged the box set from my dvd collection via ebay at a $20 loss. if you want cool japanese live action, check out returner, or ichii the killer or the zeiram series.

this film is strange, even for a silent movie. essentially, it follows the adventures about a engineer in post-revolutionary russia who daydreams about going to mars. in this movie, it seems like the producers know the communists have truly screwed up the country, but also seems to want to make it look like they've accomplished something good.then we get to the "martian" scenes, where everyone on mars wears goofy hats. they have a revolution after being inspired by the earth men, but are quickly betrayed by the queen who sides with them. except it's all a dream, or is it. (and given that the russian revolution eventually lead to the stalin dictatorship, it makes you wonder if it was all allegory.) now, i've seen good russian cinema. for instance, eisenstein's battleship potemkin is a good movie. this is just, well, silly.

a dedicated russian scientist dreams of going to mars. he eventually gets there but it takes the whole film before we are able to have a laugh at the russian style of revolution in mars.

i have barely managed to view the entire film... only after about 85min out of the movie's 110min did the journey to mars begin, and then there were 5min left for the closure. these 85 long minutes were very boring and didn't contribute anything to the film. when finally reaching mars, it wasn't much better plot wise. it all could have been fitted into much shorter running time and nothing would have been missed.what i cannot understand is the piece of trivia saying the because of the film new-born babies were named "aelita"... why would someone want to name his/her baby after a villain, who despite having only one eyebrow, apparently has 3 breasts???the only interesting thing here is the sets and costumes for the mars scenes. they are an interesting experiment in constructivism, just as "the cabinet of dr. caligari" was for expressionism, five years earlier.i give it 4/10 for the great looking design...

on the opening night of the san francisco silent film festival i was quite excited to see films that are historical and well not common. the guest speaker who opened this film created a sense of hype towards the obscurity, and how this film is underrated. the sci-fi part of the film was very interesting and fantastic for its time, but i'm not sure if it was due to the fact it was shown directly after the brilliant 1928 "the wind" or if it seemed that russian filmmakers take after what russian novels are famous for (hundreds of characters, tangled plots) but i know for certain that the dramatic parts, as in the parts on earth, made absolutely no sense, were boring and i became lost within about twenty minutes. maybe it was the acting but i found myself convinced as to why this film is "unknown and underrated": it's boring, there is no plot or basic story and the acting is horrible. this certainly is no "battleship potemkin", however i will say that russian films do not make a real good effort in lightning up what life in russia is like.

this movie has been a classic in my part of the country because it was filmed in my own small town. i now have many friends who are guards at dixon correctional, and i myself worked for 3 yrs at the superamerica store next to the krogers store the old lady was at. however, this is still the dumbest movie ever made, destined to be introduced by gilbert godfreid or rhonda shearer, if it hasn't been already. a bit of trivia, illinois doesn't even have parole hearings, and dixon prison is a medium security facility housing burglars and vending machine vandals. the classic clucking/seduction scene is perhaps the most amusing piece of writing i've ever seen, especially with the suspenseful build-up

i consider myself a big fan of low budget horror movies. the more bizarre and imaginative the film, the more blood and guts, the better, and i really fall in love with cheaply done flicks if they are done right. luther starts out well enough... his origin at the circus, a creepy run at a supermarket, an attack of an old lady, and his disturbing occupation of a woman's farmhouse all set the mood nicely. a hot sex/ shower scene ensues when the woman's daughter and daughter's boyfriend arrives at the house. when luther steals the boyfriends motorbike the movie takes a turn for the worse. the characters are presented with numerous opportunities to: a) save their loved ones, b) get the police to help, c) escape, or (most importantly) d) kill luther!!! i can't feel empathy or fear for characters that are too stupid to help themselves. chareters snub chances to arm themselves with guns and knives while luther is away. a policeman eventually arrives and is equally ineffective in stopping luther, even though at one point he has a rifle squarely aimed at luther while luther clucks and does his rendition of the polish chicken dance. i found myself futilely coaching my television: "make sure he's dead!", "hes gone, get out of there!", or "just kill him already!" luther is a bloodthirsty savage, but he is hardly hannibal lecter. if you can't outsmart this egghead, you deserve what's coming to you. by halfway through the movie you'll be so lethargic to the fates of the half-wits that only morbid curiosity will sustain you to last to the mildly amusing ending. this movie was noted as one of fangoria's 101 greatest movies you've never seen... well fangoria is half-right in the case of luther the geek.

luther the geek (1990) is a dull horror movie and is really bad even by troma's standards!! it's about a freak who bites the heads off chickens, and kills people by biting their necks out, and he actually thinks he's a chicken himself!!!!! luther gets released from prison after 25 yrs because apparentely he's been a "model" prisoner and deserves another chance in life (which is very hard to believe after you see how he acts and treats people throughout the movie).after killing an elderly lady in a supermarket car park, he manages to sneak into a womans car, and proceeds to torture her, her daughter and the daughters boyfriend at their family home in the country.then we get treated to a long winded and boring movie, with awful acting all the way through, before a useless cop turns up to try and kill luther once and for all!! oh and the film has a ridiculous and laughable ending too!!! i love low budget horror movies and i think "the toxic avenger" is an all time classic, but i'm afraid luther the geek is just boring, illogical and dull, not much in the way of gore too, just afew bloody neck bitings and thats about it! 3/10

revisiting old films that you thought were average isn't necessarily a good thing. they sometimes get worse. championed by the fangoria camp (in gorezone they labeled it "the scariest film since texas chainsaw"um, no), luther the geek inexplicably developed a cult following as an "intense" horror picture. actually, it is just an average stalk and slashuh, bite film that briefly sets itself aside from the pack by featuring a killer who clucks like a chicken. yes, clucks like a chicken. to the filmmaker's credit, at least they didn't make the killer sound like a duck a la the new york ripper. that would just be silly.narrative logic is completely abandoned in luther the geek. i'm not saying that slasher films are abound with reason, but at least in halloween michael myers escaped. luther is actually paroled after a lengthy scene where people argue he is reformed, even though he clucks like a chicken and has razor dentures (which he apparently fashioned in prison). it is the kind of film where a couple sees a bashed in door and the girl dismisses it by saying, "oh, my mom must have forgotten her keys. she forgets a lot of things since my dad died." the kind of film where the hysterical mother runs into a cop looking for luther and tells him, "the killer is in my house!" so what does he do? he grabs her and literally drags her back to the house and says, "just show me where he is and i'll do the rest." why not call back up? it is too bad the film is filled with such horrible action and dialogue because the luther character is actually pretty interesting. most of the credit goes to ed terry, a dead ringer for tom noonan in manhunter, who gives the clucking luther a genuine air of menace. in the hands of a right director, luther the geek could be on the same level as sonny boy or santa sangre and be a true cinematic oddity. but albright is not that director and merely places the fascinating character of luther in tedious slasher trappings.

this movie reeks. no money, no acting, no nothing. i caught this on on the 3am late show movie tonight and felt compelled to comment on it. this movie has nothing to recommend it. i can't believe it ever got released to us television! nobody in this movie can act their way out of a paperbag. the lame attempts at comedy fall flat on their face, the special effects consist of a worm-like handpuppet "monster"... i can't even begin to tell you how rock-bottom this production is. it looks like it cost maybe $50,000 to shoot, but only because it is on 16mm, and that is probably a generous estimate! anyway, i lost interest rapidly and had to settle for watching "matlock" reruns instead of finishing it. that's how bad this movie is!!!

i picked up this movie and was horrified to find out that the movie is based on a rape of a little girl that the parents knowingly take their daughter to. my first thoughts were that i have never been more ashamed to be an indian as well as a hindu. i found this movie to be down right appalling. please don't waste your time. as for the music, there are at most 2 horrible songs and the film used is cheap. the beautiful scenes are not what india is known for. i just hope that i have shed some light on how disgusting this movie really is. yes it may highlight how evil people in power especially when it comes to religion may be, but to sit down and watch almost 2 hours of this movie can make almost anyone gag. if your up for a good indian movie watch something by director mira nair.

as i sat watching this episode i kept glancing at the clock waiting for something to happen. as the hour wound down i thought they were really going to give us a big pop at the end, and then - nothing. the whole family is huddled around the christmas tree like something from the hallmark channel then, fade to black.perhaps one of the poorest season finales i've ever seen. nothing at all to drum up any excitement for next season. the only thing thrown out as any sort of incentive to watch the next season was the ambiguous nugget offered up by agent harris while pawing a sub sandwich that the guys in new york were looking to get one of the guys in new jersey. wow, really? i would never expect something like that from mobsters, i'm on the edge of my seat.it almost seems like they're trying to get everyone to lose interest. they start more plot lines that end up just disappearing than any show i've ever seen. they tease and hint but rarely deliver any more.what's with the arabs that hang out at the bing? they keep throwing them in front of us and magically, nothing happens.paulie knee caps some kid after tony promised his mother that nothing would happen to her son and, poof, gone in the wind.and how many more meandering drug montages with christopher are we going to have to endure? please, have him get arrested or overdose or something interesting.this was one of the few shows that i used to looked forward to watching but now, forgetta-bout it.

this season lacked real oomf, but, as far as setting up stories to get us in the mood again, season 6 is without highlights and spontaneity.this season lacked its usual sopranos style, and if you cut out all the garbage that was filled in each and every episode this season, you probably would have had 6 episodes worth of real stories.side stories like pauly's mom, is she or isn't she? was boring and had no purpose other than further exploration of his character. i would have like to have seen bobby express his anger more at pauly in that carnival episode, but to no avail.and that's just it! these side stories had no real purpose, and lack finishing. if they are going to finish off these stories in the next 6 episodes, i'd rather not watch it, because, its not really worth seeing.disappointing is to nice a word to say about this season and its finale.

sorry i couldn't disagree more ,with the last comments . frankly i thought this was worse than carry on columbus , enough said . last film for the usually brilliant charles hartrey who looked out of place as the humour had move on to the highly witty level of on the buses, films of which were being made at the same time ,were frankly funnier .barbara windsor was embarrassing,a character like one of your mums flirty friends who still thinks she's eighteen , on holiday with some non entity of a scotsman , rab c nesbit he ain't. the series miraculously trundled on with duffers like carry on behind ,and carry on england . carry on dick wasn't bad , but really with this film the end of the series was nigh , a pity because up to this film i cant think of bad film before this?

i have always liked the carry on films, with their double-meaning sexual innuendo dialogue and moments of slapstick comedy, but i can see why the critics give this one two stars. basically, many british people are gathering on a coach to go on a spanish holiday to an island called elsbels to the palace hotel. what they didn't know is that it is not completely built, plus they have to share bathrooms with their neighbours, they have crap draws, and many other complications and complaints that the owner pepe (peter butterworth, putting on quite an amusing accent, e.g. peace sounding like the bad p word). starring sid james as vic flange, kenneth williams as stuart farquhar, charles hawtrey as eustace tuttle, joan sims as cora flange, barbara windsor as sadie tomkins, kenneth connor as stanley blunt, an apparently crap (i personally can't remember who he is) jimmy logan as bert conway, june whitfield as evelyn blunt, hattie jacques as floella (a ridiculous hag character, not as memorable as her usual matron), bernard bresslaw as brother bernard, sally geeson as lily, carol hawkins as marge, jack douglas as harry and patsy rowlands as miss dobbs. i admit it is not great, but there are just enough dialogue gags, and of course babs in the shower, and going to to her bum with that iconic whistle, and later a rapid rip off of her bra. okay!

i generally loved the carry on movies but this one is actually pretty awful. there are very few laughs because the whole thing is so forced.there is plenty of talent on the screen and some come off better than others. june whitfield, kenneth williams, hatti jaques and peter butterworth are fine but barbara windsor looks tired and sid james is just tacky. joan sims comes off well but in the case of the usually wonderful charles hawtrey its just plain sad. when you think of the sad end to his career the movie is almost too depressing to watch. the homophobia of the movie is nasty and its a very unpleasant experience. the set looks cheap and unlike other movies in the series the movie is very clearly set in england. the sea side looks cold and there is little attempt to create any illusions here. it looks like a cheap production. you will be surprised at how miserable you become watching this especially if you loved the series.

oh what the heck, i'll reveal the secret: this movie stinks!yeah there are some nifty dinosaur effects that, for their time, were probably really exciting to watch. now they don't cut it, but they're not terrible. they're just good enough to tolerate without being able to laugh at it. so they just sit there, and i sit watching this, not laughing, not excited, just, well, bored. it stinks!if i can exercise my jay sherman for a moment, the film really does. the box promises cowboys versus dinosaurs, and in very generic sense it delivers. guys dressed like cowboys fight a couple of big dinosaurs. but really these guys are a bunch of sissies, and the hero is a loser (more on this later) and the dinosaurs are hardly intimidating. the plot is a yawner, and there isn't much technically wrong with it that's there to laugh at. it's all just gray and bland.after some dreadful night cinematography (filmed in one and a half colors i called it), we get the plot which involves some people, doing stuff. that was what i caught. oh and they are at the turn of the century in mexico, so they at least dress like cowboys even if they don't act like it.so a bunch of these people, who i think were human, they go in the desert, and they stumble on these dinosaurs (after they find a miniature horse...i don't know, let's just move on). then the movie degrades into a really pathetic king kong ripoff in the final act. at that point i had lost the will to even keep my eyes at television level, and i drifted in and out of consciousness.the "hero" is played by the guy from beneath the planet of the apes who essentially played charlton heston's part when heston decided he didn't want to be in the sequel. he was picked cause, shock o' shocks, he looks exactly like heston. that's about all he has going for him. i was really upset when he was the hero of the film cause all he does is glower, snear, bag the chick in the film (who's named t.j...unfortunately she's not a prostitute or finally the origin of the name would have been revealed). meanwhile his friend kills all the dinosaurs, saves the day numerous times, and what does he get for it? not recognition, no nothing! and he dies, sacrificing himself for his friends! they don't even wait up for him while they escape!boring, long, slowly paced, with little to enjoy until the film decides to carbon copy king kong's script onto it's own, it's best to avoid this film unless you enjoy pain on the scale of dropping an anvil on your eyeball.

i'm racking my brain, but i can't seem to think of another movie quite like the valley of the gwangi. a western with dinosaurs? what could be more natural? you gotta wonder why john ford and/or john wayne never tried it! the plot  while searching for a mythical miniature horse for her circus, tj breckenridge (gila golan), tuck kirby (james franciscus), and the rest of the cast/characters enter a strange, lost valley. there they find not only the miniature horse, but some other, more fearsome creatures as well. dinosaurs rule this place. now wouldn't that be an attraction at tj's circus  a caged t-rex? it's not that i find the valley of the gwangi a bad movie, i just don't seem to have enjoyed it as much as many others who have posted comments on the movie. there are some parts that i actually find almost unwatchable. for the first half of the movie, there just doesn't seem to be much going on. i wasn't necessarily bored, but i did want something to happen. plodding would be an adjective i would use. to top it off, the movie features a very contrived love story. it feels forced as if the writers decided that the male and female leads just had to get together. but the valley of the gwangi isn't a total waste. there are moments i really enjoyed. who doesn't get a kick out of the scenes of the cowboys on horseback trying to lasso a t-rex. you just don't see stuff like that every day. ray harryhausen's creatures are impressive. there are some really cool shots of harryhausen's miniatures interacting with people and horses. it might not represent the best of his work, but the effects are very nice. still, at least in my mind these good moments aren't enough to overcome the negatives. as much as i hate to do it, i've got to rate the valley of the gwangi a 4/10.

this movie is so predictable when you know the modern american dream: do nothing, be a loser and then suddenly... whoah! you're a genius and an obnoxious one and the world is kissing the ground you are walking on.and surprisingly all the other smart people are losers. they don't know anything and are bitter when our wonderkid solves problems so easily. and what kind of problems? they are so difficult but still these professors can analyse the results in less than 10 seconds.every movie has something good in it anyway and robin williams is it in this one.

i sat down through 2 hours of pure boredom. i look here on imdb, even though it is not high on the list, it is in the top 250. i was a little surpised. even though, yes. i am very impressed with robin and matt's acting abilities, they still didn't save the movie. i'm not sure what i really didn't like about the movie. maybe it's because i dispise math. maybe i'm not too much for dreary talking for 2 hours. even though i loved "american beauty", but that was it. i just want my 2 hours back. it was a big waste of my time. if i'm missing something in this movie, please e-mail me. i am curious why this is on the top 250. and don't say "because it was a good movie".2/10

when hollywood is trying to grasp what an "intelligent person" is like, they fail so miserably, finding it hard putting words in the mouth of the purported "genius".right, any genius walks around trying to rub in his superiority at every instance. sure, they hang out in bars and pick fights  it's not like they are (generalizing wildly) autistic nerds who never have a tan.plus, if you are a genius you know all about math and history and politics and of course you're constantly up to date with current events and a thorough analysis of them. coz these things, like, all go together n stuff, y'know?plus, you walk around with a smirk all the time. you are just a smug son of a you-know-what, that's how it is, y'all. and of course you smoke, like someone who never smoked before, but you smoke coz it's like cool n stuff, y'know. and you're different. that is understood.and of course you can fight  you're a bully. a bully who finds time to study 10.000 books whenever he doesn't lift weights. and whenever he doesn't smoke or drink beer because he follows a strict health regimen.and you date a 30-something college student  minnie driver. well, i won't even comment matt damon. team america has hit the nail on the head already.this movie is a daydream of a beavis & butthead type student (in other words 95% of them): "yeah, that's what i would be like if i was a genius." but stupid people and stupid authors in this case cannot imagine the lives of geniuses.

sappy.i liked how they went to the "haaavaad baaa" to quote books at each other to impress the ugliest girl there.probably the janitor at my school is a genius too but is waiting to land that big construction job.just because you keep your nose to the grindstone is no reason to try to cut a steak with it. "do you like apples?"the guy nods or something."well, how'd ya like dem apples!" wow, that is genius.duh, minnie driver would give her number to anybody. robin williams can't paint and keeps the good books on the top shelf. and there's a professor who always wears a priest scarf for no reason.

so many fans, so little to show for it. i know, i know, these words are gonna find me in a great minority. a lot of people really liked good will hunting. but seriously please, great film making, not even close, and let's put the blame where it belongs... in the writing.now, i know they won an oscar for it, and boy did they look good emoting on the screen. but good will hunting is an abc after school special with lots of cursing in it, and a slightly bigger budget.what this movie does show, is the brilliance of harvey weinstein and miramax pictures. mr. weinstein could take manure, feed it to you, and make you believe your eating bon bons. and that's exactly what the studio did with the film. they created such high faluttin buzz around it, that people believed, and wanted to believe it so much --- that they saw brilliance where there was none.now, i know some people think it's a great movie, i don't think it's a horribly bad movie, i like to compare it to more in the middle of the road movies, and also to some great made for tv movies (although, not hbo films, hbo films are unusually better than good will hunting would ever be.) it's just a nice, little film, with some good performances, robin williams was not good in it, they just gave him the oscar cause the'd been itching to do it for a while. and of course, the miramax public relations machine secured ben and matt their screenwriting oscar... but come one people... there's better movies out there thatn gwh.

i'm not surprised that so many people fell for this one. when i was watching this movie, a couple viewers next to me sobbed whenever you're "supposed" to sob -- or at least feel "touched". like when hunting said he didn't love the girl. like when robin williams' character (sorry i forgot his role's name) was telling hunting repeatedly "it's not your fault" (oh lord, just thinking of that scene gives me the goosebumps). i couldn't have cared less for what would happen to the characters. many people sob for hollywood manufactured characters they can't even relate to (think titanic; yuck!)... but it really only made me cringe and want to get out of the theatre. i guess i simply refuse to be psychically and emotionally manipulated by all this.folks it's not me who's being condescending ... those characters are, and for no good reason because they're unreal. worse yet, nothing is new or surprising. even robin williams' character is all cliched.i gave it 1 out of 10. it's probably not that bad; it's just quite mediocre... but so many people went to the other extreme and gave it a 10 so i figured a single balancing vote won't hurt.

what is about mathematical geniuses that get the critics juices flowing ? a beautiful mind wasn`t up to much in my opinion ( fellowship of the ring deserved the oscar that year ) while good will hunting had several awards lavished on it undeservedlyfirst off is the script . when i attended film school i was told good will hunting is a very good example on how not to start a script and the tutor was right . this movie lacks any type of opening hook and for the most part it`s very very slow . if you wrote an unsolicited script like this the script reader would have given up on it by page 15structure aside the idea of a member of the american underclass being some sort of intellectual god doesn`t really ring true . ask yourself this : if he`s the cleverst character in the movie how come he`s gone through his short life without anyone noticing his abilities ? not one single teacher from his childhood noticed his gift ? highly unlikely as is the fact he`s read so much mind expanding litrature . and if will`s so clever how come he`s so oblivous of what happens to young good looking boys in american prisons ?but it`s the casting that let much of the film down . you want to get a couple of actors to play rough tough irish gang members ? let`s get matt damon and ben affleck which is like getting russell crowe to play a pacifist or charles bronson to play a liberal do gooder . i failed to be convinced by the foul mouthed damon and affleck as they strutted about smacking people in the chops and couldn`t help thinking that even though they wrote the script the parts should have been awarded to different actors , after all billy bob thornton has written screenplays for films he hasn`t been cast in and the same criteria should have been applied herethere are some good points to the movie . robin williams is excellent as the man who tries to show will his potential and also very good is stellan skarsgard who is quite simply one of the greatest character actors to stepped foot outside of europe and despite my previous criticism of the script there is quite a moving piece of dialogue at the park as williams character explains to will what he has seen in lifebut i`ve got to repeat that there`s less plus points than negatives to this movie and i`ve got to agree with the people who`ve said good will hunting is boring and unconvincing

enormous suspension of disbelief is required where will's "genius" is concerned. not just in math--he is also very well read in economic history, able to out-shrink several shrinks, etc etc. no, no, no. i don't buy it. while they're at it, they might as well have him wearing a big "s" on his chest, flying faster than a jet plane and stopping bullets.among other problems...real genius (shelving for the moment the problem of what it really is, and whether it deserves such mindless homage) doesn't simply appear /ex nihilo/. it isn't ever so multi-faceted. and it is very rarely appreciated by contemporaries.better to have made will a basketball prodigy. except that damon's too short.

oops. i hired this because i thought it was bitter harvest (1981), which was recommended. after the appearance of the appalling patsy kensit, i checked the recommendation and discovered my mistake. ok, it's watchable, because the main characters are very sexy, but the acting is awful. stephen baldwin looks morose the whole time, which is understandable, considering his co-star. is patsy competing with liz hurley for the title of the most obviously useless actor on the screen?

a truly masterful piece of filmmaking. it managed to put me to sleep and to boggle my mind. so boring that it induces sleep and yet so ludicrous that it made me wonder how stuff like this gets made. avoid at all costs. that is, unless you like taking invisible cranial punishment, in which case i highly recommend it.

i bought this film as i thought the cast was decent and i like jennifer rubin & patsy kensit.first off let me say the acting is not of a high standard. stephen baldwin makes his character look almost retarded at times and at other times morose. patsy kensit is so-so but not too convincing in some scenes, and the supposed poetry she spouts in a particular scene in her hotel room is utterly meaningless rubbish. ms kensit is certainly very suggestive and sexy here but ultimately i think jennifer rubin is by far the best in this film. ms rubins character is at first innocent, then sexy, as she plays stephen baldwin's character (travis)for a fool. the supporting cast includes adam baldwin(no relation to his more famous namesakes) & m.emmet walsh who has appeared in many films, also i noticed art evans who was one of john mclane's allies in die hard 2. the movie is decent and there are a few nude scenes with rubin & kensit, a bit of action but this is certainly not a fast moving or intelligent thriller. there is a particular scene when they are in the car about to commit a crime and stephen balwin's character is wearing sunglasses and when you see him again, the area around his eyes etc is painted black instead, then the sunglasses reappear later when they are leaving the crime scene and police are in pursuit, a very obvious error in editing. if you are fans of either of the ladies or either baldwin then you may find something to like here, but others should steer clear. this is a reasonable but unremarkable thriller and not really worth more than a couple of dollars if you want it.

it's a shame, really, that the script of this film had more holes than you could shake a stick at (mixed metaphor intentional), because kinski and coyote - both supremely talented performers who are capable of great subtlety and nuance - have wonderful chemistry together, and the always-provocative fairuza balk didn't hurt the mix either. jeremy piven would have been great here too, if his character (and all the other supporting characters) hadn't been written as a plot device. as for the main proceedings, the writers just didn't know how to create the suitable guilty-or-innocent tension for kinski's character -- instead they gave us confusion, contradiction and, by the finale, downright let's-hope-the-viewers-don't-notice claptrap.

in "red letters", coyote is at the vortex of as a college professor who writes to a female prison inmate and gets more than he bargained for. there are two reasons to watch this flick...kinski is one and piven the other although it's difficult for their sparks to shine in such a complete directorial disaster. everything is wrong with "red letters"...convoluted, lousy screenplay, camera, editing, and most of all acting which is subpar for coyote, etc. battersby has taken a story with potential and turned it into a seriously flawed and amateurish flick not worth the time.

what a great cast and what a pathetic attempt at a film. the script is full of holes from beginning to end. incoherent, not cohesive...utterly ridiculous. one of the most talented/beautiful actresses in the world (and i'm talking about nastassja kinski) is without a single memorable line here. worse, she supposedly dyes her hair halfway thru the movie, but it's obvious she's just wearing a cheap black wig bought from a drag queen costume shop. the best moments are given to a character actor and his dog in the apartment building that lead actor peter coyote lives in. fairuza balk is photographed poorly, to boot. she looks like an overweight freshman who's pigged out at too many all-you-can-eat-student-cafeteria-buffets. i was so looking forward to this film. i wanted to like it, but i think i'd rather watch nastassja read the phone book, with her own hair.

this movie tries its darndest to capture that classic bad canadian movie feel:"quirky" and obnoxious characters (a few); "quirky" town with "quirky" folk; a "quirky" coffee shop or restaurant (coffee shop here); lots of shots of canadian stuff for postcards (ocean stuff here); lots of mention of "gotta get out of this town"; downright booooring.and it succeeds on all counts.something to note, though. i couldn't figure out whether this movie was just trying to be post-northern exposure "quirky" comedy or something surreal like a drug-induced or psychotic hallucination. the editing of this movie jumped around nonsensically from one unrelated thing to another with zero pacing or motivation. not to mention the fact that half the time we didn't even know where we were jumping. take for instance, the very opening shots, of yelling teens in a car. who are they and what the h--- did they have to do with anything? and this sub - uh - plot (use that word plot loosely) concering kids that seem to span generations. i don't think they actually do, but the editing makes it look like they materialize from flashback, all of a sudden, to current time. huh? what did i miss?avoid. unless for laughs. or you want to try and trip out on the inept editing.

i couldn't help but laugh when i saw what the public could be made to think was email back in 1996. apparently email is an interactive discussion (similar to a chat) with lame voice synthesis reading every comment out loud. and some of the other "tech" aspects are also laugh-out-loud funny. i'd swear the "high tech" communications centre she has actually has a few commodore 64 monitors in it. almost like watching the movie hackers nowadays, i guess.despite the fact that for most of the movie the lead actress carries off the illusion of being disabled, the final part of the movie has an unexplained use of her legs which somehow i can't ignore. i mean, why include something so stupid? anyway, to sum up: the plot is pretty predictable, the acting bad, the killer quite guessable. but it can be amusing in a mystery science theatre 3000 kind of way i guess.

ok.. at the time of writing, 65 people voted for this movie, bringing it to a 5 out of 10 rating. my guess is that only the film crew voted. so i'm here to bring some justice to it all.never has a movie provoked the audience's intelligence more than this one. given, i laughed out loud quite a bit - but the movie/story absolutely didn't want me to.i've seen a lot of bad movies. a lot. but man, this one blows them all away.speaking '96 computers, ridiculous acting, and wheelchair chases - and we have young tarantinos who can't get their ideas financed. yup, life's a cruel joke.

after high school track & field athelete, laura remstead, dies of natural causes during a race (an event that is shown multiple times, in slow-motion none-the-less), an unknown killer is murdering all the people who were on that same aforementioned team close to graduation day (hence the name)in this laughably inept slasher flick.it brings absolutely nothing new (or even good) to the slasher table, instead opting to merely unleash the most god-awful song i've heard in quite some time with ' gangster rock' being played in a roller-disco party that went on far too long.eye candy: denise cheshire & linnea quigley get topless my grade: d-

the title for this review about sums up how i feel about this movie. i can't imagine what audience there would be for this thing, if not for the die-hard fan of 1980s slasher films who simply has to see -everything- from that era. otherwise, don't even waste your time on this.the story is similar to most films of its type: something awful happens to one of the characters in the opening scene, which inspires a bloodthirsty killer to go on a murderous rampage. been there, done that. truth be told, none of these '80s slashers were known for their originality, so i can't see the point in harping on the film simply for this.but where the film fails is in its suspense and murder sequences. i've seen some pretty scary slasher movies from the 1980s that had far lower budgets than this. this one just fails to create any real suspense. the director throws in some nice camera angles and some semi-professional directorial touches here and there, but they mean nothing if you're not frightened. the gore is pretty tame as well, so anyone who watches these things with the intention of seeing some cool 1980s makeup effects will be sadly disappointed.the movie manages to clunk along rather dully. honestly, the key ingredient to almost any slasher is the tight pacing--you have to keep things moving along swiftly and keep the murder set pieces staged at regular intervals, because, let's face it, we don't watch these things for the great characterization and stellar plots. but the pacing, whether due to the script or the editor, is all off. the murders are spaced out at odd intervals, leaving us with some long-winded scenes (no doubt meant to build "character") that serve only to bore you and leave you praying for the next kill (which, as i've said, usually isn't executed all that well anyway).as for the killer, don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening. he (or she?) wears a jogging suit, a fencing mask, and his (or her?) primary weapon is a sword. i bet the writer just wet himself over thinking he came up with an original, "cool" murder weapon, but the idea just comes off as impractical and silly. there's also not much emphasis placed on the "whodunnit' nature of the film, as if they either forgot or don't care to place any red herrings in the mix to throw us off.i have the sense that the people behind this were trying to make something decent and respectable, and at times, it shows their intentions were probably a bit more genuine in regards to making a quality film as opposed to countless other knockoff slashers from the era. but alas, the attempt fails for the most part. there is, however, some pretty good acting (at least, for this type of film). there is attempt at characterization, but none of it ends up meaning anything in the end, so...what a waste. here, all it manages to do is bog down the plot and make the murder sequences feel like they can't come soon enough.in the end, if you're really into these old '80s slashers, by all means, check it out, if only to say you've seen it. there's a completest in all of us. but don't expect to be blown away or anything. what we have here is a very mildly entertaining slasher movie that leaves no real impression at all.

this movie was sheer, slow, plodding torture. not being a fan of slasher films, and preferring classic horror, i may not be the best judge. slasher fans may enjoy this as an early entry into the slasher genre. i really would like the 90 minutes i spent watching this back. the only reasons to watch this are 1) a young vanna white (pre wheel of fortune) who has about 3 minutes of total screen time. 2) an early role by scream queen linnea quigley (with nudity), and legendary beauty ej peaker as the school secretary, who added a bit of humor and sex appeal. otherwise, an 80's band called felony makes an appearance, which while interesting, drags on way too long. just like the movie.....i had to keep checking how much time was left and couldn't wait to "graduate" to a better film.

for me, reviewing movies is an extension of my love of film--and of horror cinema, in particular. the reviews i've written thus far have been for films that i love, respect, and admire, and i have eagerly rewarded them with glowing accolades and perfect-ten ratings. a life-long horror movie fan, it is a tremendous pleasure for me to be able to share with others my thoughts and ideas about great horror films, and to, hopefully, have a hand in exposing people to movies they may not otherwise seek out. i only recently began reviewing films for the imdb, and it was my initial intention to concentrate only on my own personal favorites, examining those which i believe are of substance and of lasting value to the horror genre. however, the existence of films like "graduation day" is, without pun, a thorn in my side. completely devoid of any merit whatsoever, this 1981 hodgepodge of unformed ideas is amateurishly directed, poorly acted, and, in every sense, an unmitigated embarrassment to horror cinema. during the brief couple of years before and after this movie's release, we saw the appearance of domestic (and canadian) films such as "halloween ii," "prom night," "terror train," "madman," "my bloody valentine," "the prowler," "just before dawn," "final exam," and "hell night," among others. these films, though of varying degrees of quality, clearly strove to achieve something in terms of story line, plotting, acting, direction, and overall tone. not every movie released during this bountiful season of the slasher era would be of the artistic merit or commercial success of the original "halloween" or "friday the 13th," but these films were all well-made and clearly contributed to the ongoing development of horror cinema. "graduation day," an abysmal farce about a masked killer stalking members of a high school track team, was directed by herb freed, whom one can only hope will never again attempt to besmirch the horror genre with such a travesty. the task of creating worthwhile horror films is best left to those who have a genuine love and respect for the genre. this movie fails miserably on every possible level, not the least of which are dreadfully wooden performances, dime-store special effects, an irritating musical score, and, most of all, a story lacking even the slightest hint of tension or suspense. a pointless exercise in how to waste film, "graduation day" is an utter disgrace to horror cinema.

"graduation day" - i bought this movie this past week and waited for some time where i could kick back and relax and watch some "good" 80's slasher gems, i got this and "xtro" to watch, never seen any of them. i just watched it and realized my outdoor speakers were on also. i only imagine what my neighbors thought when "felony" came on to sing their one 10 minute hit? i'm sure it was loud and i'm sure they think i'm weird, with that and the chainsaw sound and screaming from other movies.this was a pretty sub par slasher movie, no suspense, no story, some cool deaths, almost seemed on the amateur side, i usually like movies like that, but it just didn't click with me, now i will watch "xtro" for the 1st time and have a margarita!dj eric austin tx

pretty lame and awful slasher about someone killing the members of a high school track team after their star runner dies during a meet.christopher george gives a hilariously over-the-top performance as the track team's coach. i don't think anyone has ever taken track and field as seriously as chris does here - not even in the olympics. it's a typically divine cg performance, and if you are a fan of the man/the legend, you should run right out and grab a copy.but we watch slashers for the murders (you know it's true), not the performances, and graduation day fails to deliver on most counts (there is one really good kill). true horror only comes during a performance by the band "felony". never heard of 'em? watch graduation day and find out why.

this film is slow. this film is cheap. this film makes friday the 13th look like a best picture nominee. the acting is crap. the special effects are crap. no one dies for like 40 minutes and all the people do is act badly. the only thing that saves it is it's ability to make you laugh at all the stupidity going on. the funniest part is watching the heroine "fight off" the attacker. she supposed to be trained but she fights like a 70 year old. they spend pointless scenes on people who don't die and no scenes on people who do die to the point where you don't even know why they are dieing. i love slashers but this is just crap.

first and foremost i wish to aim a big & mean middle-finger towards the troma dvd-distribution crew, who were actually stupid enough to reveal the identity of this movie's pivot killer on the back of the cover! the synopsis just randomly mentions who's the person responsible for the massacre on graduation day, for christ's sake! i don't care how terrible or how predictable an 80's slasher can be; just mentioning who did it ruins the whole point! so, a word of advise in case you also purchase the troma double-feature containing "graduation day" and "nymphoid barbarian in dinosaur hell", do not  repeat do not  turn the box around and read the back! watching the film is already a painful experience, but reading the back would really spoil everything.now, as for the actual the actual movie oh boy! personally i'm a fan of the cinematic 'work' of herb freed. well actually, i don't really know whether i should admire himor pity him! all herb's films are pretty bad & amateurish, but at the same time you can tell his direction is spirited and full of good intentions! unlike with "haunts" and "beyond evil", he followed a contemporary popular genre trend and tried to cash in on the typical high-school slasher films. just to offer a minimum of originality, all the victims in "graduation day" are promising athletes and members of the same track of coach george michaels (awesome name! i guess herb freed is a fan of "wham!"). during the opening credits, we witness how a young girl dramatically dies on the field, moments after winning a 30 seconds running race. the debate of whether or not her coach and fellow track team-members weren't pushing her physical limits too much is raised, but one particular individual goes one step further and begins to sadistically kill everyone he/she considers responsible for laura's death. what a demented little movie! the script must be one of the most incoherent ones i ever beheld, with loads of red herrings and sub plots that go absolutely nowhere and death sequences that are almost too cheesy for words! there's a bloke impaled by a football attached to a javelin, others are decapitated with an absurdly big sword and the unluckiest bastard of them all even falls to his death on a disguised bed of spikes! herb concentrates on the ingeniousness & the fast pacing of the killings so much that he totally forgets about the sub plots he introduced earlier in the film! for example, laura's sister returns home from her military training and seemly starts an investigation regarding the circumstances of her death. halfway through the movie, however, her character hardly appears in the movie anymore. also, the girls' stepfather is referred to as a violent drunkard but this interesting given immediately gets ignored as well. instead of carefully mounted suspense and misleading red herrings, we're served disco-dancing & roller-skating sequences and  of course  numerous images of unattractive 80's chicks stripping their tops off. despite being really bad, "graduation day" could count on a respectable cast! christopher george ("grizzly", "city of the living dead") greatly stars as the demanding coach, carmen argenziano ("when a stranger calls", "the accused") briefly appears as a police detective investigating the rising number of missing teenagers and michael pataki ("dead & buried", "dracula's dog") has a very amusing part as the school's stressed out principal. the teenage beauties on duty include linnea quigley and vanna white. heck, for some horror fans, the presence of these two ladies is enough reason already to count "graduation day" among the most quintessential slashers of the early 80's. it's a dumb film, but entertainment and chuckles are guaranteed!

an interesting slasher film with multiple suspects.includes typical girl flashing her breasts (denise cheshire) as she changes into her swimsuit, creepy suspect - any one of them could be doing the deed, expected breast baring to get a passing grade (linnea quigley), a very unusual forward pass, more bare breasts, a track and field event that will not be in the summer olympics, and a ghoulish secret.it all comes to a crashing ending. no, there's more. won't this guy die? i bet anne (patch mackenzie) doesn't plan any more visits home anytime soon.if you like teen slasher films, can you possible be a pervert, even if all the actresses are over 18?

after their star cross-country runner dies after a race, the members of a track team are stalked and killed by a mysterious masked murderer seeking vengeance for the girl's death.from the beginning of this film, it was quite obvious it was not going to be very good (at least as far as true quality goes). the 'dramatic' track race at the end of the introduction scene was one of the least believable sporting events i've ever seen in a film. it would seem that the winner of the race had never actually run before in her entire life. not just run track. . . but, run at all. ever. from there, we get a horribly unrealistic female navy member who was breaking numerous appearance rules with her jewelry and make-up, not to mention the fact that her hair was hanging loose onto her collar while in uniform. ridiculously awkward camera angles, pathetically done gore effects, and acting that ranged from frighteningly over-the-top to boringly under done (all in one actor, mind you) all help to make this film one of the most unintentionally hilarious horror films ever made. on the other hand, the writing wasn't all that terrible and the story was actually okay. but, the direction was horrible, made worse by offensively bad cinematography. the acting ranged from acceptable to just plain abysmal. regardless of all the embarrassingly bad elements, however, there's something here, whether it be cheese or something else that i can't figure out, that makes the film extremely enjoyable and very worthy of a watch. maybe it was just vanna white.obligatory slasher elements:- violence/gore: death scenes were fun enough, but the gore was just awful: blood squirts from impossible angles, no actual gashes or wounds from knives, etc. but, this film has the first 'death by football' scene i've ever seen.- sex/nudity: there was a bit of nudity (i mean, linnea quigley is in it, after all), and some overly horny high schoolers, but nothing to excess.- cool killer(s): if you think leather gloves, stop watches, track suits, and fencing masks are cool, this one is for you.- scares/suspense: not really any at all. there is one moment that takes place in the girls' locker room that i was preparing myself to be scared at. . . but, it just led to some typical stupidity and was ruined for me.- mystery: a little, but if you can't figure out the killer's identity about 20 minutes into the film, then i'm not too sure about your powers of deduction.- awkward dance scene: there's a great impromptu jam session ("graduation day blues") with a guitar & harmonica that leads to some awesome 80s bopping. this is followed shortly by some kind of weird blend of 70s disco and 80s break dancing that was probably the scariest part of the film.final verdict: 4/10. don't take it too seriously and you might enjoy it (just like most everything else troma touches).-ap3-

six months after high-school sprinter laura dies during a race, a killer begins to murder the rest of the track team using a variety of sports equipment as weapons: that's the daft plot of early 80s slasher graduation day, a lacklustre addition to the genre that offers very little in the way of style, originality or decent gore.what it does deliver, however, are some stunningly awful musical interludes, a few familiar faces (including an early appearance from scream-queen linnea quigley), and a smattering of nudity (a prerequisite of any slasher movie!).so forget the death scenesthey're lame and rather bloodlessand instead enjoy the movie's more memorably crap elements: the rapid editing that can induce migraines and epileptic seizures; the roller disco, which is accompanied by a prolonged heavy rock song, ' gangster rock', as performed by the unforgettably awful felony; an impromptu jamming session by the school's students; christopher george hamming it up as chief red-herring coach michaels; and the cheesy music teacher who letches after his female students (who, for some reason, find him quite irresistible?!?!).towards the end of the film, the action picks up a little, with the discovery of the slaughtered kids' bodies under the bleachers, and a quite twisted scene featuring laura's corpse in her cap and gown, but it all comes way to late in the day to save this film from mediocrity.

next stop on our journey through the calender-slasher scene is... oh yes, "graduation day"! all of those seniors, just brimming with possibility and ready to venture out into the real world and become adults. that is, however, if they can make it to graduation without having to tangle with the campus lunatic who's running around, gouging the life out of students with his fencing sword... yeah, it all stems from a the high school track star who drops dead from a blood clot during a race and a year later, her older sister returns home from the navy for graduation. the track coach holds the blame and broods in his demoted position in shop-class while the girl's boyfriend still mourns her death a year later... all of these characters are prime candidates for "serial slasher of the year" and you just have to sit through this movie until the end to find out who-done-it. "graduation day" is fun, though it isn't spell-bindingly original by any means and there aren't a whole lot of memorable demises, but there is enough going on to keep you mildly entertained. like linnea quigley screwing the music teacher and getting busted with a joint, 30 year-old actors playing teenagers, and of course... rollerdisco! gotta love that crap! you can do a lot worse than "graduation day", kiddies...

a high school track star falls dead after winning a race; shortly after, her older sister (patch mackenzie) returns home in time to notice that all of her sister's track team members are disappearing. who could the killer be? you may not care enough to want to find out.crude, cheap, amateurish slasher is just about completely worthless, although top-billed christopher george (as the nasty, hard-driving track coach) tries to give it a lift with an intense performance. not even the gore is worth mentioning. the whole thing is lame from beginning to end, starting with opening the movie to a track meet montage set to disco music, and the casting of e.j. peaker, once a co-star of the movie "hello, dolly" as a character named "blondie"! that's right, "blondie". this may mean that we aren't supposed to take the movie seriously, but in any case it's a shambles.it's the kind of routine slasher junk that makes the "friday the 13th" movies look like works of art in comparison.the only point of interest may be wanting to see an early film appearance by vanna white, of all people.2/10

some of the secondary actors try, really hard. and camera shots in the desert are quite lovely. otherwise, this film is horrible.william shatner's character, harvey, is an amateur screenwriter. he's also a psychopath, a man who quite literally escapes from a mental institution. is the point of this film that amateur screenwriters are psychopaths? harvey will do anything to get his script read and turned into a movie, even if that means taking a film crew hostage. do amateur screenwriters ... grovel? maybe they do.the film's setup is way too long. we don't get to the point of the story until well into the second half. the first half darts and flits among assorted characters."shoot or be shot" is touted as a comedy, but i found it totally not funny. dialogue contains no subtext. none of the characters are believable as real people. they're all stick figures that perform "action" in a way that resembles cartoon characters. indeed, the film is basically a cartoon for adults: silly, inane, birdbrained.i can understand why some actors are in this film. they need the money or the exposure. but what are insiders shatner and harry hamlin doing here? maybe shatner wants more comedy roles. is this the best he can do? is hamlin that desperate for money? he used to be a respected actor. what happened?even though the story is supposed to be a satire, it comes across more as a put-down of amateur screenwriters. maybe that wasn't the intent. but that's certainly how the film can be interpreted. as such, the script was very, very poorly written.

uggh! hanna-barbera of the 60s and 70s! what lousy and unwatchable cartoons that were thrust upon us by these hacks! it's a shame really, as in the 1940s and 1950s "hanna-barbera" meant quality--because they produced so many wonderful tom and jerry cartoons. however, with the major cost-cutting efforts of the late 1950s, cartoons in general began to look pretty poor and budgets were slashed. in fact, william hanna and joseph barbera were fired by mgm and replaced by a team of czech animators who had never even seen the original cartoons! so, in the late 50s, the team was out of work and decided "if you can't beat 'em, join 'em"--and began producing horrid little cartoons themselves--with horrible animation, backgrounds and writing.it's unfortunate, but the team's production of crappy cartoons worked too well---making them rich and the most successful producers of cartoons of the 60s and 70s. during this time, again and again, bad production values was their norm and a long list of very forgettable cartoons were created. in this case, the amazingly bad inch high private eye--a completely unfunny and stupid idea. if you want to know what the show was about, the title says it all.rotten to the core and strong evidence that the production team had total contempt for us kids!

i was wondering when someone would try turning that whole matamoros mess into a goreporn pic. anyroad, here's a few things i learned about mexico from watching this film.~all mexican women are super hot - remember that little desert town in unearthed? yeah, well, this must be it's mexican sister city. don't even bother with the hookers, just put a few smooth moves on the hot bartender. she'll be just as hot as the prostitutes and probably doesn't have any kids as well! ~half of mexico is controlled by insane satan-worshiping palo mayombe cultists. ¡ay, caramba! the other half, as everyone here in the u.s. knows, is run by drug dealers. fortunately, this doesn't much interfere with the sex-tourisim trade and our ultra-low wage factories down there.~mexican cops are useless. don't go to them. go to the nearest occult bookstore and ask the hot chick behind the counter what happened to your vanished friend. she'll be way more help than the cops.~when you're being gruesomely tortured by the aforementioned bloodthirsty cultists, don't go reciting the psalms or any part of the bible, really. you'll just mess up the mojo.

this movie clearly has an agenda, which could be summed up like this: never, never cross the border (either physical or metaphorical). let's shun everything that's on the other side with a wall or a fence or something else, let's pretend all "gringos" are evil, satanic, or drug dealers. all that is outside one's country's border (and specially us borders) is dangerous, malevolent and people there will hate you, or envy you or try to steal you or something else. the "based on true events" is only a perverse tag that can be pinned on anything to give it some aura of credibility or, in this case, just to help pushing the film's ideology down some naïve throats out there. the perversity of the film lies in the fact that it reduces countries, people and all else into very black and white stereotyped categories: mexicans into disgusting people, mexican police into a bunch of corrupt cops, republicans into the right-wing morons, democrats into almost hippie humanists and so forth. is there anything good about the film? i hardly think so, but may be you think differently.

ok, if you like yer monster moovies sullen, stiff, starchy, and thunderously dull, but with lots of throttling, then head right for "lady frankenstein", a stagy, costumy italian corpse-walker. joseph cotten("citizen kane")plays the crusty old baron himself, and must have really needed to make that condo payment. sexy sarah bay, who has played in cow-ntless european b-films, usually as rosabla neri, including "hercules against the moon men", plays his ambitious daughter, a surgeon in a ruffled prom dress. cotten makes an ugly, big-headed monster (cud it really be that much effort to make a nice one??), who immediately throttles cotten(who took his royalty check & ran), and wanders around throttling everyone in sight. tania(bay) decides to switch the brain of her lover(who is old and wrinkly) with the brain of a younger man (who is "beautiful", but stooopid), in order to make another monster to throttle the first monster cotten made, who is wandering around throttling people. well, after much exposition, and some throttling, the 2 monsters throttle each other for a bit, tania stabs the first monster in the back, and then has sex in the flaming ruins of her mansion with the second monster - only to have him throttle her! doh! there is so much throttling going on that you almoost overlook the fact that the film is about as exciting as a dead carp, and mooves just as quickly. the alpha video version i saw for this review was heavily edited, and one wonders cow much nekkid people were chopped out, not that it would have improved the film much. director von theurmer previously helmed a variety of grade z euro-trash, including "jungle warriors", "island of the dead"(as mel wells), and "the crucified girls of san ramon". the moocow says avoid this corpse of a film, and find something that mooves at moore of a full...throttle. ;=8)

pretty lousy made-for-tv sequel to the roman polanski classic. rosemary's son adrian has grown up and is embodied by creepy stephen mchattie. after eliminating rosemary (here played by patty duke) a coven of witches, again led by minnie & roman castevets, preps satan's son for world domination. it's not really scary and light years less macabre than its predecessor. instead, writer anthony wilson and director sam o'steen opt for a satan-worshiping thriller full of a lot of chanting, plenty of candles, and ruth gordon trying to act daffy and nasty at the same time. gordon's the sole holdover from the original. george maharis replaces john cassavetes as guy and a very hammy ray milland plays roman castevets, subbing for the late sidney blackmer. newcomer mchattie is the film's only real saving grace. he's very off-kilter and looks really sinister without even doing anything. the music by charles bernstein is suitably creepy, but so over-used, it's ends up being intrusive rather than effective. o'steen, who edited the earlier polanski masterpiece, shows no flair or subtlety whatsoever.

with its few touches of surrealism, lwhtrb works as low-grade horror, but as a major follow-up statement to the original, it flounders miserably. things begin somewhat promising during the telefilm's opening credits... we see and hear several interesting shots and sounds: the baby's black crib with the overhanging, inverted cross; the kitchen knife rosemary carried into the castevette's apartment and dropped in shock (the utensil is shown sticking out of the hardwood floor); and the emptiness of the bramford itself, without tenants or furniture (voice-overs can be heard here from the previous film's dialog). interesting too is the easter egg hunt the titular child participates in (the eggs and baskets are also black). once the story gets rolling, it never really 'rolls'... and what happens to rosemary when she boards that driverless bus, and is whisked away to god-knows-where? patty duke (a poor replacement for mia farrow), ray milland and tina louise (as the southwestern whore who raises the child, "adrian/andrew") head this almost-star cast, with ruth gordon reprising her "minnie" role.although not a total failure, this sequel-of-sorts should have been released in book form first, then maybe we all could have been a bit better informed... and not left totally in the dark. a fairly recent sequel novel "son of rosemary" (1999?) is the legitimate followup by ira levin himself.

sam o'steen, the film editor on the superlative suspense flick "rosemary's baby" from 1968, here directs a quickie tv-made sequel, one in which rosemary woodhouse (patty duke astin, in for mia farrow) is shunted off early--and inexplicably--presumably to help flesh out the more ghoulish aspects of this flaccid story about satan's son on earth. most interesting is the return of ruth gordon to her oscar-winning role as minnie castevet (with ray milland well-cast as her husband, roman), but she isn't given much to do--and looks terribly uncomfortable at being involved anyway. this script is strictly low-rent goods, and must have shamed original author ira levin (who went on to write his own sequel). fairly dim and pallid, with poor photography and no suspense or scares whatsoever.

i usually seek to find good in movies, even the bad ones.unfortunately this movie is one where i fail miserably-and the fact that there's barely one positive review on this board shows many imdb reviewers share my pain.i don't usually watch sequels but i just had to see this since i love "rosemary's baby" so much. what a mistake that was. it simply reaffirms my belief in the fact that most sequels are lousy-though thankfully, very few are as bad as this. in fact in my mind this isn't even really a sequel, it's a satire on how bad a sequel can be. movie recommended very highly for not viewing-at any time-ever.

for a movie that gained so much recognition and appraise this spinoff to "rosemarys baby" is one big mistake. it starts off that andrew/adrian whatever his name is because he's so confused that he doesn't know who he is anymore runs away from a cult with his mother and soon is kidnapped by a strange lady that ends up taking care of him as if she were his mother. the acting is terrible as andrew grows up in his twenties and looks terrible with his sunken in face, never ending grin and dukes of hazard clothes on looks more like a drunken has been than the son of satan. in fact thats all he does is drink and falls sloppily all over himself as he tries to come to grips with his past and the last memory of his mother driving away on a bus screaming to him. he finds a friend that seems to be an angel but he's quickly killed off and electricuted in a hillarious scene in which he looks more like a christmas tree. andrew gets cought and the cult with the members of the first part test him to see if he's really the son of satan. his dumb self fails the test and gets up off the alter glittering with myme makeup and jumps of the stage of a night club and dances like a clown on crack!!! this scene is memorable and well worth a watch. the ending is terrible and somewhat predictable considering how stupid he is in the whole movie. do not watch this piece of trash or you will loose respect for the first part.

this film is a bad film but to gain any nutritional value from it i recommend watching it back to back with rosemary's baby.there is a lot to learn seeing how different directors can draw different performances from the same actors playing the same characters. observe minnie castevet (ruth gordon) and the fine work she did in the first film vs the awful rendition in this film.it is also interesting to see how the same characters were played by different actors. which leads me to wonder if anyone involved with the sequel were aware of the first film and did any of them watch rosemary's baby before making this?if your interest in films is purely superficial then you would best avoid this one. i have a lot more to say about this film but i really don't want to go there.

i was hoping that pulp would be a interesting movie, but was profoundly disappointed.pulp has very little storyline, and what there is never holds your interest. it was a real struggle to keep watching it. when its over you say to you self "huh? that's it?!?". this is one where you think after watching it - why did they ever bother?its too bad since michael caine is a good actor. i was also hoping to see the great lizabeth scott in this, but she only appears on screen for a total of perhaps one minute. scott is one of the all time great film noir femme fatale girls and this was her last film.oh well...

this is a silly spoof of private eye thrillers as a novelist(michael cain)is called upon to 'ghostwrite' an autobiography of a colorful, waning hollywood star(mickey rooney). at times silliness becomes obnoxious. this is not cain at his best. rooney is way over the top. notable support from lizabeth scott, lionel stander and the comely nadia cassini. not easy to watch.

five fingers relies heavily on barbaric, shock value hollywood tactics to elicit apparently a positive movie-going response. this is where this movie fails throughout, primarily because it is too graphic to be taken seriously. i was repulsed and disgusted that five fingers was even made, and essentially had to force myself to continue watching it. torture in and of itself is gruesome. even the sounds coming from a room where someone is being tortured are gruesome. but obviously the makers of this stinker of a movie felt that was not enough. it had to go way beyond what was needed, and simply and effectively ruined any chances this movie had of making some sort of valid point. for this reason, this movie came across as nothing more than being self-gratifying. five fingers also pretty much relegates itself to a b-movie status solely by its indulgence on manipulation of time. in other words we are shown the present and then the past is revealed in snippets. this is a little bit of a twist of the normal hollywood manipulation of time. whereas the viewer normally is shown page 95 in a 100 page script as the beginning of the movie, and then the rest of the flick is essentially explaining the ending, five fingers is dedicated to flashing back, which gets quite tiring by the end of the movie. overall, five fingers made me feel stupid for watching the whole movie, because torture is obviously obscene, and it certainly was not necessary to resort to graphic mutilation to make this point. i am surprised that dick cheney did not make a guest cameo appearance at the end as some sort of torture superhero. this movie is a perfect example of what happens when an important topic falls into the hands of greedy, mindless dolts.

- contains 1 spoiler, market with: ***** -not presenting itself as yet another remake of "the interview", five fingers actually is. alas, besides maybe the hardship of physical torture, it never adds anything to it's predecessor's accomplishment in terms of suspense, plot or performances. in fact, five fingers never gets anywhere near its level. what i found to be in particular painful to watch wasn't the torture itself, but the way martijn (ryan philippe) acted out his ordeal. to me it looked as if philippe tried too hard to get his accent right and it made his performance glibly amateur which in turn even dragged down the performance of an otherwise great colm meaney. phillipe's accent btw, being far from anything near dutch, sounded more like eastern european. besides the acting of philippi(which to my surprise turned from poor to actually decent towards the end) there is the matter of the flashbacks with the hackneyed dutch scenery. (if these scenes were set in switzerland they would have had the cast eat cheese on mountaintops with endless pastures with grazing cows wearing expensive timepieces). scenery aside, the way these flashbacks pushed the plot didn't work for me at all. it made it being served like french fries at a drive-in and caused the build-up of suspense to flatline.admittedly the movie did become more enjoyable as phillipe's acting improved but i couldn't help being annoyed every now and then with scenes that were just too implausible. e.g.: ************ start spoilerat some point (after days) philippe is almost tenderly washed by the female terrorist. this only to be followed by the brute severing of yet another finger. why give the guy a wash if he's in for a torture? and the severing of that last finger seemed to only serve the title of this flick anyway, i mean, he was practically begging to have it knifed off. didn't make sense************ end spoilerwhat ultimately kept me watching was the performance of fishburn who once again proved to be a brilliant actor but who also had the best part of the script to work with.all in all one is just far better off seeing "the interview" with that other matrix-icon: hugo weaving. and when you do, i'm confident you won't find this review that disagreeable.3.5/10"the interview", 1998 www.imdb.com/title/tt0120714/

it's complete nonsense. i've studied nazism and read many manuscripts from the day - the "parallels" use most of the classic debased apocryphal myths of nazism and then compare it with complete specious generalizations about what constitute 1/3 of the planet. it's crafted for an audience of polly-anna complacency who diet heavily on spoon-fed gibberish, horribly thought out arguments, irrational conclusions, fallacious ideas, and nonsensical logic.who made this hit peace? easy.when all is said and done; que bono? that is, who benefits, in the long run?you don't. you sacrifice money and rights. muslims don't, they get our bombs. try again. answer this, and you've unlocked a major door.

this film is strictly for fans of debbie reynolds and eddie fisher.i get angry at tcm for showing this mess more frequently than bachelor mother, the delightful original. i get angrier still that some hollywood boob thought it would be a good idea to remake bachelor mother, filling it with some lame songs that only serve to interrupt the flow of a cute comedy. instead, hollywood could have spent the time, money, energy and talent wasted on this horrible remake to give us something new and original - wow, what a concept!bachelor mother (the original), with ginger rogers and david niven is a spicy stew, simmering with sexuality. it is a 1930's wink at the hays office. bundle of joy (the remake), with debbie reynolds and eddie fisher is strictly milk and cookies. it is a 1950's handshake with eisenhower.which cast would you rather watch - debbie reynolds, eddie fisher and adolphe menjou, or ginger rogers, david niven and charles coburn? for me, every member of the cast in the original version is far better than his/her counterpart in the remake.in the original a beautiful, young ginger rogers is at her peak. david niven delivers perfectly as a somewhat spoiled, sophisticated and yet befuddled scion of a wealthy department store magnate. and i always love to see charles coburn in a movie. in bachelor mother, he is priceless as the desperate grandfather wannabe.in bundle of joy debbie reynolds is her usual perky self. she is fine in this role, although her performance (along with fisher's) completely changes the tone of the story. as an actor, eddie fisher is hopeless. he is completely lacking in screen "presence." here he is way too wholesome for this story. his acting is completely bland and clueless. likewise, his singing is so bland and unremarkable that it has been completely forgotten by the world at large. the only time he is not completely painful is in butterfield 8 - where, incidentally, he doesn't sing. here, fisher's lame performance alone is enough to ruin this movie. adolphe menjou, a favorite character actor, delivers a competent performance, but not one of his best. he is more blustering than commanding. he and fisher are not convincing as a father and son.do you see a musical for the music, the story being merely incidental? or do watch a musical for a story, with some (hopefullly) good music used for seasoning? if the former, you might like this lame remake. otherwise you are much better off watching the ginger rogers non-musical original, bachelor mother.

theres not much you can really say about this film except that it was crap and probably the worst film i have ever been to see!! take my advice don't watch this film it just wastes your money and time!!i gave this film a 1/10 which is doesn't deserve.

lord protector is kiddie fare, but for whose kids? obviously shot for television or stv, this amateurish rehash krull has several stock characters -- a magician, an assassin, a warrior, a scientist -- on the trail of something or other in order to defeat the dark forces about to be unleashed on their planet. badly written, acted and staged in available california locations like municipal parks and a ranch, lord protector has nothing to recommend it, not even as a time waster. jay underwood is the only "name" actor, and most people, especially the intended audience of five year olds, are not likely to remember him from such ancient disney fare as not quite human. a no-name actor playing a magician in an ill-fitting silver wig at least plays it with tongue planted firmly in cheek, while those around him act as if they are in a dinner theater production of king lear. i was hoping at least for a decent action or special effects sequence. alas, the action sequences are pathetically staged and the few special effects are those old fashioned painted-over cartoon gags we used to see in 1950s and 1960s fantasy flicks, like bert gordon's the magic sword. the filmmakers planned a sequel that mercifully never came to be. often, such cheap hollywood back-lot productions use a combination of legit and porn actors. i kept myself occupied during the film's seemingly interminable running time, trying to figure which was which in this one. i didn't have much luck.

i have spent the last 5 years in the entertainment business and most recently find myself working for the company that made this movie, which is a real pity, because i like these folks, i just can't believe anyone could possibly make anything as bad as this?!!!! this was crap from every possible angle. from camera work to dialogue to acting to costumes and production design was one of the worst films i have ever seen! the actors in this film looked like they had been taken straight off of a porn that was being shot in the san fernando valley and put on a set with an even less talented crew.i just can't get over the fact that i am sitting on some of the best material i have ever read and contacts within the industry that could help me make my dream a reality and have hit every roadblock possible? yet the folks behind this spectacle of a film have no problems putting it together and in fact, sleep well after it is released.life, what a trip!

i can't even describe it. it's the worst movie i've ever seen (i'm being a nice guy when i call it movie).just another big-budget-made-to-someone-who-doesn't-like-to-think-much.it's not even scary. it's revolting when there are great movies that never reach the big screen and then comes this..."thing" to trick movie fans. i guess big producers make whatever they want.just get a big producer, hot chicks (allthough horrible actresses) and a ton of horror movie clichés and cook it for a week or so, and you'll get "the nun".and i thought bad boys 2 was horrible!!!!

i can only say this: ee03128 from portugal, i couldn't say it better. the worst movie i've ever seen... and i've seen lots of crap! when i read you comment i thought only about the thoughts i had while watching the movie. when i saw who was one of the script writers i understood it. balagueró uses the same tricks in all his movies. and his scripts are not much better either. and, of course, in barcelona we have tons of temples and churches around the city so we can keep cursed nuns to scare young americans coming on vacations. please, be serious! and i do not want to talk about the quality of the actors... there is something remarkable too. it is fair to recognize it. compared to the usual level, all the spanish actors use a fairly good english

the nun is a revenge picture whereby a very strict nun is killed by her rebellious trailer trash charges and comes back years later to get even when the now adults visit their old school. story line is predictable in spades and will hold no surprises as it slowly winds its way to the end. it is a screamer of a movie with passable acting and a below average script and screenplay. much of the special effects are low grade and there is almost zero believability in the final battle. still, if you look past these there is some suspense and acting jewels. if you like senseless cookie cutter screamers, you'll like this, otherwise you should pass.

more suspenseful, more subtle, much, much more disturbing....

most american remakes of european films are pretty poor, but this is in a league of its own. in fact this might even be the worst (sandra bullock) movie ever made. i daresay i might have passed it off as just another innocuously bad hollywood thriller had i not seen the dutch original, spoorloos. the altered ending here is stupid enough (and executed with particular ineptitude), but a far worse crime than that is removing all the intelligence and depth of character that marked out the original as a classic. the real horror to be found here is in the fact that the same man who directed spoorloos is responsible for this atrocity. will the real george sluizer please stand up?

george sluizer's remake of his own - superior - film is a complete waste of time. why was it even attempted? kiefer sutherland plays jeff harriman, whose girlfriend (sandra bullock, who only has a small amount of screen time)is abducted at a service station by barney cousins (jeff bridges). now, barney is portrayed as the kind of guy that no one would trust in a month of sundays - he lopes about like frankenstein's monster but without the sympathy, and bridges' acting is totally awful. sutherland comes across a little better when his character turns detective with the help of new love interest rita baker (nancy travis).a major problem with this version of 'the vanishing' is its obvious need to cater to hollywood audiences by avoiding the bleak ending of the original film. here the ending is happy which seems forced and unbelievable, and completely wrecks the story. however by this time the damage has been done as jeff bridges turns the bad guy into a huge laugh.

this movie was so poorly acted. what was with jeff bridges accent, horrible and unbelievable. was it supposed to be french, scandinavian?the script was lame. to have the heroine trip over the grave of her boyfriend while running from the jeff bridges character...are you kidding me? how convenient that jeff brings his dirty shovel in the house after he disposes of bodies in his lawn. do these people just not believe in calling the cops? okay...i'll get into the car with you, why not? duh! why was bridge's daughter obsessed with making her dad have an affair, is her mother that evil or just plain dull? i did not see the original, it would be hard to make myself after seeing this movie.

there are just so many things wrong with this movie.jeff bridges weird accent.rita's ability to crack the password code the entire script the ending - esp the last scene when two coffees are brought to the table for jeff and rita and the publisher. j & r laugh and say "we don;t drink coffee anymore". well, why did they order it then??? they obviously did. if they didn't and the waiter brought everyone a coffee by default there would have been three coffees.total tosh.

i can't believe this movie has 6 stars on imdb. this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen that wasn't an episode of mystery science theater 3000. the plot is predictable. i couldn't bring myself to care about any of the characters. the dialog is cheesy. several moments in the movie actually made me groan out loud (including kiefer southerland's crazy neighbor and the incredibly lame joke that ends the movie). jeff bridges' accent is goofy - i can't tell what country he's supposed to be from. it has to be one of the least thrilling thrillers i've ever seen as well...after sandra bullock's character disappears, absolutely nothing happens to advance the story for a good 45 minutes. i would give this movie a negative amount of stars if i could.

a real insult to the original "spoorloos", which is one of the most genuinely disturbing films (and i intend this as a compliment!) i have seen in the last years.where the original is chilling and brilliant, the remake is flat and even boring, especially the "happy end" finale takes away what little suspense there was in this film in the first place.while such a distortion (especially grafting a "happy end" which wasn't there previously) is quite frequently the case in "hollywood" remakes of european art-house movies and could've been expected, the biggest disappointment lies in the fact that this inane mess was created by the very same filmmaker who did the original "spoorloos"...why mr. sluizer decided to ruin his masterpiece in such a fashion is beyond me.avoid this abomination at all cost, as it might spoil the original for you even if watched *after* that, let alone the other way round...

a couple are split apart during a vacation. early scenes lead us to believe barney, jeff bridges' character, has kidnapped the girl in an unexplained but premeditated abduction. the film plays out some years later where, despite a new love interest, jeff (kiefer sutherland) is determined to solve her disappearance.the storyline is definitely intriguing but there have been some really bad decisions made during the making of this film, culminating a pretty shoddy piece of work.ok here we go. the abduction scene - aside from two major continuity errors there is a point where sandra bullock and kiefer sutherland are made to perform a little signed-pet-love-ritual that's drowned in over-sentimentality to the point of nausea. we know they're in love; the "i do solemnly swear never to leave you" speech only moments prior was ample thank you. jeff bridges' robot accent is another example. what is that for? starman is back and it seems after a decade on the planet, he's turned nasty. the entire plot is then able to be resolved by the introduction of a needless character who, by a rather fortunate twist of fate, has quite miraculous powers of observation. the climactic sequence itself has essentially been done before only much, much better. it's riddled with further annoyances and another blinding continuity blunder. i could go on but something positive needs to be said. at a stretch, kiefer sutherland is the only one to save face with a fairly decent performance.the 1988 original of the same name (changed from the dutch title 'spoorloos' for english speaking audiences) was recommended to me, only for an online rental company to send me this later hollywood version by mistake. i was surprised to find both having been directed by george sluizer and would be interested to know his motivation for the remake. i am reliably and thankfully informed it is of a much higher quality in all areas including plot. horah for that, but it really doesn't take much doing.

i've watched this movie, after having seen the original "spoorloos" a few times, in anticipation of the chilling ending.i can't even begin to explain the anger and disappointment that i experienced when the ending came, and went, and the movie continued to have a happy ending. what a waste of time it was watching this us remake...if you have a choice, please skip "the vanishing" and watch the dutch original "spoorloos". the suspense is very well built-up. you feel the frustration of rex, in search of any trace of what might have happened to his girlfriend saskia, after she entered a gas-station and never returned to his car. the search takes him three years, and when he finally gets in touch with the person who knows the truth about what happened to saskia, he must agree to undergo the same thing that saskia has undergone. the ending leaves you speechless in your chair....

man, what an awful film. as with many terrible films, the structure of its awfulness lies in the script. this is such a pathetic attempt at a psychological thriller that it gives the entire genre a bad name. okay, here's one major problem: sandra bullock's character is abducted by jeff bridges in his car at a busy convenience store in broad daylight. somehow, her boyfriend kiefer sutherland doesn't find a single witness to this act and subsequently spends most of the movie completely clueless as to her whereabouts. come on! personally, i find this completely insulting to even the dimmest of audience members. yet we are forced to buy into this nonsense. of equal frustration is the poorly explained motive for jeff bridges's actions. his character is a bit of an eccentric academic, to be sure, but far from the sociopath who would do these things. he goes through about ten minutes, give or take, spilling his beans to sutherland as to why he has performed his cruel actions. but the explanation itself lacks even the most elementary sense of logic. therefore, no intelligent audience member can really believe in the possibility of his evil. and if you subtract that element from the story, the entire thing falls apart.also of major concern: -jeff bridges using a weird, pseudo-french accent for no reason.-the entire boring subplot involving nancy travis, most especially her saving the day by turning the tables on bridges.-the crazy woman who somehow manages to remember jeff bridges' license plate number despite also thinking that the lucky charms leprechaun is real.-sandra bullock's character's name, diane shaver, conveniently re-scrambles to form the word "vanished". are you friggin' kidding me?? -the logistical impossibility of drugging, abducting, and burying (in a very remote location) a human being within the span of forty minutes (as bridges specifically alludes to).this is a movie that made me remember the fictional, impossibly stupid (yet very successful) donald kaufman character in adaptation. many screenwriters are brilliant, inspired artists. some are just bozos who convince the nitwits running the studios to make their drivel. this particular script is so stunningly dimwitted that donald kaufman himself would have managed to sell it. unfortunately for all of us in the real world, todd graff actually did.

flockhart's performance is very disappointing. it seems she is trying to make up for her lack of emotion by substituting obscenities. why the r rating includes 'sexuality' is beyond me. there is no nudity or steamy love scenes. the plot is old and tired.

if this film won the lumiere award for best french-language film, then what kind of garbage is coming out of france these days??the subject matter is an important one -- how the african economies are kept as economic hostages by the international organizations that are supposed to be helping them, namely the international monetary fund and the world bank. about 40% of the governmental budgets of several african nations go to payment of western debt, while their people suffer from disease, dehydration and illiteracy.... but the subject matter was treated in the most dry manner that could be conceived by man -- dryer than the sahara that surrounds the country of mali in which this film takes place. more monotone and action-lacking than any documentary i've ever seen (and i'm a fan of the genre), one "witness" after another comes forward in this "trial" that is "captured" on film that condemns the world bank & imf. some critics may site the colorful visual asides within the film, but they were out of place and had no complementary soundtrack when they were on the screen. they belonged better in a coffee table book than in this film.even the characters in the film say something like "this trial is boring" and "when will it be over?" everyone in the theater laughed. were those people on the screen reading our minds??danny glover had a brief appearance in this film. it is a televised movie within "bamako" and it was set within morocco or mali. it was also more ridiculous than any spaghetti-western i've ever tried to avoid. the only redeeming part of these five wasted minutes was where a caucasian bad guy accidentally shoots an african woman carrying a baby and shows no remorse whatsoever. perhaps it was to symbolize the insensitivity of the world bank and how it is unintentionally killing africans.and one last technical parting shot, the subtitles were difficult to read with so much light colors on the screen and not enough black outline to the subtitles themselves.i've already summarized the movie for you. don't be fooled by the hype. no need to see this film. you'll never get these two hours back in your life.

endless repetition about the evil world bank, imf, globalization, and the americans are blamed for all of africa's problemsand the movie is long, about two hours, but it seems longer. the french actually occupied mali, the country in which the movie takes place, for centuries, but are only peripheral bad guys.one doesn't learn enough about any of the characters to really care what's happening to themthey are completely marginal to the preaching, which goes on and on and on. there's no plot, no character development, no humor (except for a few pokes at bush and wolfowitz, but that's almost cheating it's so easy) and the production values are mediocreno redemption there.it is amazing that a movie can spend two hours preaching about such a big topic and convey utterly zero real information. the irish ballad "i was dying, and then the famine came" has more content.the movie is boring, the sub-titles are tough to read, there is no real content about the subject of the film, and the propaganda is relentless.skip this one.

abderrahmane sissako may have known what he was doing when he made "bamako," but the rest of us can just sit back in mystification and confusion trying to figure out what that purpose might have been.the nominal "plot" involves a young african singer who's planning on leaving her unemployed husband to find work in the city. but far more of the screen time is taken up with what the publicists for the film describe as "a mock trial against key financial institutions" dealing "with the overwhelming economic hardships of africa." that's all well and good, i suppose, but when the arguments and ideas are put forth in as undramatic and pedantic a way as they are here, they lose both force and impact. put another way, if the director had found the means to actually incorporate issues such as the injurious effect of colonialism on the african people and the problem of african debt into anything even remotely resembling a compelling storyline, the film might have achieved the intellectual and emotional resonance it now so clearly lacks.the topics the movie is dealing with may be relevant and important, but trying to pass off what amounts to two hours worth of speechifying as an actual, honest-to-god movie is not likely to garner much of an audience for one's message.

this film has it's heart in the right place, but unfortunately, it isn't much of a film. it is more of a documentary under the guise of a narrative. bamako is basically a newspaper op-ed piece put on celluloid. however, your average well-researched op-ed piece is far more cogent and concise than anything presented here. the filmmaker is trying to relay to the viewer the hardships of african life, in particular the country of mali, due to the unethical practices of the imf, g8, and world bank, by using the setting of a mock trial against the aforementioned. there is an extra 10 minutes dispersed throughout the film that makes a half-hearted attempt at a narrative plot, and a bizarre hollywood western-style shootout scene, where the director seems quite pleased with his own cleverness (hence, the frequent godard comparisons).of course, as the film begins, what and who is on trial is never explained, but as we know by now, the french refuse to spoon-feed their audience.there are many impassioned arguments made, but they are often long-winded, delivered in a shrill monotone (one that becomes quite easy to tune out after awhile), and very light on specifics. the last point is the most frustrating of all since there is a very well-reasoned specific case to be made against the institutions on trial here. unfortunately, all we get in 2 hours is that the imf and g8 are evil oppressors and should forgive 3rd-world debt. we are given no more than the occasional hint to the specific reasons why the organizations on trial are guilty, but never a clear case. the mock-trial arguments and the footage of the surrounding village makes the suffering of these african residents clear, but one wonders why we must sit through 2 hours of it, when a far more precise picture could be painted in a 20-minute newsweek article, or bill moyers episode. in the end, there is something very important to be said on this issue, it simply isn't presented very well, or very clearly, in this pretentious, indulgent piece.

i was looking through tv guide last night and saw a movie starring heather grahm on, who i liked in movies like boogie nights, and austin powers, so i decided to watch it. it started out ok, but you could tell the story was lacking, and at about half way through, it started to deteriorate. i do not remember this movie being in the theaters, and i'm sure if it was, it wasn't there long. the acting was stale and unconvincing, the dialogue was silly and predictable, and the story was confusing and stupid. definately one of the worst movies i have ever seen, and i like movies like the ones this has been compared to like fight club, but this one doesn't come close!! heather grahm has done much better things since. i gave it a 2 out of 10 but thats because i clicked on the wrong number, i meant to give it a 1.

i got hold of this film on dvd with the title evil never sleeps, it gives front cover billing to carrie ann moss, but she plays such a minor character that i didn't really notice her in the film.i'm afraid that i consider this one of the worst purchases i have ever made. the dialogue was stilted and the delivery wooden, i found the acting to be disconnected from the plot. graham's performance to me was of someone who's wondering whether she's left the gas on at home.all in all both my wife and i found this film painful to watch, and it is not a valuable addition to my collection, watch it at your peril, but spending 90 minutes having your fingernails pulled out would probably be a better way to spend your time.

honestly, this is a very funny movie if you are looking for bad acting (heather graham could never live this down... it has three titles for a reason- to protect the guilty!), beautifully bad dialog ("do you like... ribs?"), and a plot only a mother could approve, this is your friday night entertainment! my roommate rented this under the title "terrified" because he liked heather graham, but terrified is what we felt after the final credits. not because the movie is scary, but because somebody actually paid money to make this turd on a movie reel.horrible movie. there are a few no-name actors that provide some unintentional comedy, but nothing worth viewing. heather graham's dramatic climax also was one of the most pathetic and disturbing things i have ever witnessed. i award this movie no point, and may god have mercy on its soul.

what a crap that movie is. the script is simply non existent. the movie at times seems like a music video. but it cannot even be that since the soundtrack does not really match. pathetic way of combining action and rap. one might think it being a recipe for a successful flick... here it fails miserably. dialogues in this flick just killed me. the scene when harlan is interrogated by some policeman is merely pitiful. generally speaking, recent seagals films are hardly watchable. what the hell happened to the guy? i know he's old but can't he get "hollywood" to drop him a decent script or something? is he running out of dough for his escapades to india that he takes on anything they serve him?

the film quickly gets to a major chase scene with ever increasing destruction. the first really bad thing is the guy hijacking steven seagal would have been beaten to pulp by seagal's driving, but that probably would have ended the whole premise for the movie.it seems like they decided to make all kinds of changes in the movie plot, so just plan to enjoy the action, and do not expect a coherent plot. turn any sense of logic you may have, it will reduce your chance of getting a headache.i does give me some hope that steven seagal is trying to move back towards the type of characters he portrayed in his more popular movies.

really? is this necessary? how can somebody make such a film? disgusting!!! seteven seagal with funny hair and fat like an elephant. stunts all the time, cars persecutions with an annoying soundtrack. not to mention the ending. completely nonsense with the presence of the little girl.steven seagal wants to be robin hood!!! well, at the beginning a fortune teller answers something, nobody has asked. seagal's wife has nightmares and she can see the future. they must be kidding. steven segal passes out after a car persecution, and i know he can't act. it was terrible. nothing can save that film.i lost 90 minutes of my life! see you

stephen seagal plays the role of a dude who gets talked into driving an armored car for a bank hold up and drives into everything that comes across his path. however, the police seem to appear on the scene very quickly and seagal smells a rat who gave the police advanced notice. the story gets into many twists and turns and the money from the hold up has disappeared and nobody knows its new owner. poor seagal gets a bit framed into this hold up and naturally he is out looking for the person or persons who are trying to put him away for a long time. in this film, seagal tries to be a good guy but the forces of evil are against him. unfortunately, this is not a great film and rather boring and too long.

ah yet another seagal movie.in no less than a few mere months arrive to populate the video store shelves.as bad as submerged?no.but that is not saying much.like perfume on a pig.seagal is professional thief who wants to quit,but goes for one last job only to be double-crossed by his boss.he lands in prison and is befriended by a gangster who helps him to break out and seek payback.its good to see seagal finally not playing an agent,cop,or what he usually plays.we actually get a usa location in las vegas it seems. then an eastern european territory as usual. there is no wire-fu either here.don fauntleroy does an okay job.however most of the action and fight scenes with stevie are clearly doubles.scenes from other movies,a lack of realism and logic in even tiniest situation.seagal and treech make a so-so team inspiring(unintentional) laughs one minute.sighs the rest.several notable faces turn up to slum it.. sleepy kevin tighe is a long way from his emergency days.nick mancuso shows up in sleepwalking mode to take a check.no more rappers.please? at this point the action scenes and plots are more predictable and recycled generically more than ever.its a stale scene that seagal needs to get out of or hang it up.he should have gotten out a while ago.

i love watching steven seagal movies not because of the action of the great plot holes but just because it makes me laughoh it makes me laugh so hard this movie totally got no point and is ridiculous compared to this movie pearl harbor rocks!!! and ben affleck need no acting school at all just to give a impression how bad it isfirst off all there so many goofs and bad acting its just getting worse like when steven is try to get out of jail a chopper lands at first the security notice and they led them land when they fly away all of the sudden a guard start shootingor when he killed that guy in the car he and treach both walk away you can't see no oil on the ground behind him steven notice that there is oil without even watching treach trows a lighter and the car blows upand there are plenty of more goofs steven uses his basic action when someone is pointing a gun at him he grabs it and shoot him totally bullshit!!! like some gangster would let that ever happen.the acting is also very worse at the fight scene in the jail outdoor place you can see steven clearly wait to come in action just rewind it a couple of time and you notice the bad actingits just makes me laugh i hope one day it comes to the cinema's here in holland then i'll go there with as many friends as possible just to laugh my self to death

tdy is probably the single worst piece of trash to ever hit the straight to video selection. they take a scene from the order starring jean claude van damme and this angers me because van damme is a personally favourite for b movie comedy. segal has done some fine work in the past but he has dropped very low in my books and he will probably never pull out another undersiege or marked for death unless he sits down and has a very good brain storming session with himself. it also annoys me how he didn't do many of his own stunts like he has done in previous films. in conclusion of all this if you are prepared to see a movie fit for a trash can or woodchipper, then rent today you die.

to start off, i love steven seagal, the man is a genius. but recent movies leave me to wonder, is he trying anymore? his latest movies show almost no effort on seagal's part. in out of reach, its too obvious that his lines are dubbed over. . what seagal does in this movie is not only a slap on the face to his fans, but even more to jean-claude van damme and his fans. in the 2nd scene or so, when he prepares to zip-line into the drug dealers penthouse to steal the jewels and money, it shows him set-up the gun and hook it on a neon sign. your might be saying to yourself, 'yah, so what does this have to do with van damme?'. well that scene was stolen from a jean-claude van damme movie called the order. rent both, watch both, compare both and you will lose respect for seagal. not only was today you die garbage, but it was, dare i say, an insult. seagal's aikido moves are still good, but why isn't he doing great movies like marked for death or above the law, hes still got the moves and the attitude, i'm just left wondering 'why seagal, why?'. there are such idiotic scenes in his newer movies that have nothing to do with the storyline, and such idiotic story lines on top of that. i hope the up-coming black dawn movie will be another exit wounds or beyond justice, because these last chain of movies he made, especially today you die, really made me wonder if he has the stuff to make more great action movies like double team. please, don't watch this movie unless you hate seagal, if you love his movies don't watch this, it will make you question his future in the action film genre.

i love his martial arts style, it is quick, close up and oh so fast, but it seems like his movies are becoming more and more crime based lifestyle quality and less meaning...i thought he was out to bring forth a deeper message. at least some of the movies had a hidden meaning or agenda this one had some good redeeming qualities of the character but the rest was so far off. i was very disappointed. the martial arts is also suffering. i am hoping to see a more devoted segal in his future films. this movie also lacks in keeping the story line going, there are too many gaps so the thought is lost. too many things are cryptic without a solution.

today you die was the 4th seagal movie in a mini marathon i just held. wow, i don't know where to start. he seems to mumble his lines more and more as time goes on, and the scenes between seagal and treach where they seem to improv are embarrassing. and what did his girlfriend's dreams have to do with anything else in the plot? i can't recommend this to anyone but the most die hard seagal fan, and even then you are better off with his earlier work. of the 4 films in my marathon (submerged, into the sun, foreigner and today you die) today was the worst. a previous reviewer mentioned this but the usage of stock footage was quite obvious.

i have just seen today you die. it is bad, almost very bad.1) the direction and editing are awful, just awful. almost made me turn off the movie, fauntleroy (the director) has no idea what he is doing, he seems to be filming things at random and some scenes don't make sense at all. also, i hate it when the same scene is used again in the same movie, in this movie some scenes were used 3 or 4 times. pretty bad.2) the dialogue is sometimes good, sometimes awful. i like the fact that they wanted to make seagal's character and treach's character seem like they were in a similar relationship to the characters in lethal weapon, but it did not work simply because some of the dialogue did not make sense, and i speak english very well, it's not that i did not understand the words, it was the fact that the jokes and dialogue lines had no meaning whatsoever.3) the script is pretty bad. why do they always try to complicate dtv action movies? seagal's wife in the movie has psychic abilities, why? is it useful to the movie? no. seagal eliminates a whole bunch of people who work for the guy who betrayed him and he knows these people without having ever met them in the movie. stupid. the story sometimes goes off track and the jumps back without any reason. the story is messy and pointless sometimes. they should have kept it simple and it would have worked.4) in some of the action scenes it is not seagal, it is his stunt double. you can tell because they only film him from behind and never show his face. he also beats the guys with movie martial arts, not real ones like the aikido steven knows. the stunt double uses cheesy kicks and punches.5) steven is good in the movie. 90-95% of the lines are said with his real voice. the rest is dubbing but it is not that bad. this was good. also steven seems to be enjoying himself in the movie and is more into the action that he was in submerged. he likes treach as a partner; at least he does not seem to dislike him. also, he seems to have been in better shape than in some of his recent movies. i hate the fact that he wears clothes to hide his body, but in the same clothes that he wears on the dvd cover he looks more than ok and he should have wore those clothes for most of the movie not the stupid long leather coat.i really think that seagal was willing to make a good movie. the fact that he came late and took off early from the set on two movies directed by fauntleroy does not look like a coincidence to me. i think he realized that the crew were amateurs or only in it for a quick buck and he did not give a damn anymore.in the hands of a better company and crew this might have been a damn good action movie for seagal. something like out for justice or above the law. i honestly believe that. but the people who made the movie are not very good at their jobs or they did not have enough money to do the job properly. too bad since i liked steven in the movie and treach was cool (ice cool ) too, but the rest was bad. hey, at least this gives me hope for black dawn and shadows of the past. i think that mercenary might be just as badly handled. but hey, steven seemed to be back into the same mood he was in while making his better movies and at least that is reason enough to watch the movie.i liked it, but it could have been so much better. 4/10

today you die starts as honourable criminal harlan banks (producer steven seagal) is hired by sinister businessman max stevens (kevin tighe) to drive a security vehicle with $20,000,000 of cash in the back from point 'a' a las vegas casino to point 'b' him, sounds simple right? well what max forgot to tell harlan that the money is stolen & that he has just become the getaway driver in an armed robbery. bummer. things get even worse for harlan when the local cops catch him & chuck him in prison for a long time, however harlan managed to hide the money before he was caught & with a nice $20,000,000 at stake & unaccounted for harlan has to watch his back as the crooks want it as do government agents. harlan teams up with ice kool (!)(anthony 'teach' criss) in prison & they both manage to escape at which point harlan goes looking for some revenge...photographed & directed by don e. fauntleroy one has to say that the shot in eastern europe straight-to-video action films that steven seagal specialises in these days aren't getting any better & today you die is a good case in point. this is a terrible film, simple as that really. the script by producer danny lerner, kevin moore & les weldon gives seagal a new sort of character to get his none existent acting skills around, that of a criminal rather than some government agent/cop/soldier/one man army cliché he usually plays. in fact if you were being charitable you could say today you die is a rip-off of mel gibson's excellent thriller payback (1998) where he too played a really nasty piece of work to such good effect. while payback was a superb uncompromising hard edged film noir type action thriller today you die isn't & pales into insignificance by comparison. unfortunately here seagal is terrible, he has no on screen presence or menace either & the audience is never quite sure whether he is meant to be a bad guy that we hate or not. for instance initially his character's is set up like a modern day robin hood as he steals from the rich drug dealers & scumbags to give to the poor (as well as keeping a tidy profit for himself) which is just ludicrous in itself but then it has seagal turn around & murder a lot of people which contradicts the likable criminal with morals that the film went to such lengths to set up in the first place. the story is full of holes, for instance agent knowles is contacted by the on the run harlan & is then reprimanded by her bent superior for meeting him & it turns out that he found out by tapped her phone. in that case why didn't her boss use the information he had to catch harlan? the story is the usual dull predictable bland fight over lots of money with surprise surprise the investigating government agent is actually a bad guy! wow, i didn't see that coming i must say...director fauntleroy slows everything down to a snails pace & today you die feels like it goes on forever, the action scenes & set-pieces are also severely lacking in entertainment value. the infrequent fight scenes aren't great, most are either shot in shadow, very quickly cut & edited or with the camera played behind seagal's character to try & disguise the fact that most of the stunt work done here is by a double. again seagal looks fat & out of shape & uses long baggy overcoats to try & hide it, it doesn't. there's a pretty cool car chase through the streets of las vegas in this at the start & i thought that today you die might be alright but it seems the whole sequence was stolen from another action film called top of the world (1997) which is about a las vegas casino robbery, as well as using footage from that film today you die also edits scenes from the charlie sheen action film no code of conduct (1998), the jean-claude van damme action film the order (2001) & the wesley snipes prison based action film undisputed (2002) so quite how much of today you die is original footage is anyone's guess.technically the film is alright, considering it's edited together from four separate films as well as it's own footage it's just about competent & consistent enough. all the footage of the us locations are obviously lifted from the films already mentioned with all the original footage shot on the cheap in bulgaria. the rap style music that litter today you die is awful by the way. the acting is poor & seagal just mumbles his way through his lines as usual.today you die is a really bad film made up from other bad action films, seagal looks old & fat, the action scenes are average at best & most of the story is fairly random & it doesn't come together at the end that well at all. one to avoid unless your a die hard seagal fan, if such an animal even exists...

steven seagal is a thief who specializes in robbing wealther drug dealers, giving to the poor and unfortunate..heh, harlan, the robin hood. anyway, harlan wants to go straight for his girl, jada(mari morrow), so he takes on a job as the driver of an armoured car for a max stevens(kevin tighe, wasted in an underwritten role). max intends to have the millions for himself and his unscrupulous associates, with the intent of using his loader, bruno(robert miano)to bring him the money, but harlan has other plans. escaping the police, hiding the money, and ditching bruno(who had a loaded gun pointed at harlan's head threatening to shoot him if he didn't drive)after evading capture by ramming a huge dump truck, harlan passes out. charged with the murder of police among other things as a result of the damage caused by the high-speed chase, harlan is imprisoned and many wish to know where the money is. harlan joins forces with an inmate, ice(treach), a leader of one of the many gangs in the prison, breaking out with the plans of finding max and eliminating every member of his corrupt entourage. soon dea agent rachel knowles(sarah buxton) becomes part of this scenario thanks to her boss, saunders(nick mancuso)who claims there's drugs involved. also injected into the plot is harlan's desire to save a children's hospital about to close and jada has mysterious dreams regarding max.seagal and treach cut up with each other speaking in gangsta, while buxton spends time trying to help harlan, uncovering the possibility her boss is in cahoots with max. mancuso's character is an odd duck, allowing rachel much leeway despite the threat she is to his career. tighe shows up for five or so minutes tops, which is a shame. seagal's harlan escapes prison and finds each and every rich associate of max's, inevitably discovering his whereabouts after cracking a few skulls, snapping some wrists, and breaking some bones. treach speaks in his rapper speech and seagal tries to answer him in kind, providing some unintentional laughs. as you'd expect, a lot of people get shot and seagal doesn't break a sweat. it's interesting seeing seagal in prison, among the convicts, helping treach out when a group of "eses" plan to take him out.

this is only the second time i have been moved enough to write a review. unfortunately, both times they have been for movies that can be described with several 4 lettered words that can be defined as faeces or excrement. the other movie of such calibre was masked and anonymous.anywa, onto the review.. there are several key things wrong with this movie which i will describe below.1) steven has lost the plot (i.e. in all his other movies, family / friend gets killed. steven gets angry. steven kills people. the end).2) steven has run out of money (there was a good car chase scene at the start, but i think he blew his budget on that and couldn't afford a decent script writer or editor).3) steven no longer appears to do his own action. instead, the (from memory) 2 fight scenes were shot neck down and from the back, so you couldn't actually see his face. most likely a stunt double. i'm guessing chuck norris.in summary.. worst seagal movie ever. second worst movie i have seen in recent history, and i've seen a lot of bad movies.

ah yet another seagal movie.in no less than a few mere months arrive to populate the video store shelves.as bad as submerged?no.but that is not saying much.like perfume on a pig.seagal is professional thief who wants to quit,but goes for one last job only to be double-crossed by his boss.he lands in prison and is befriended by a gangster who helps him to break out and seek payback.its good to see seagal finally not playing an agent,cop,or what he usually plays.we actually get a usa location in las vegas it seems. then an eastern european territory as usual. there is no wire-fu either here.don fauntleroy does an okay job.however most of the action and fight scenes with stevie are clearly doubles.scenes from other movies,a lack of realism and logic in even tiniest situation.seagal and treech make a so-so team inspiring(unintentional) laughs one minute.sighs the rest.several notable faces turn up to slum it.. sleepy kevin tighe is a long way from his emergency days.nick mancuso shows up in sleepwalking mode to take a check.no more rappers.please?at this point the action scenes and plots are more predictable and recycled generically more than ever.its a stale scene that seagal needs to get out of or hang it up.he should have gotten out a while ago.

i usually spend almost as much time writing my reviews as i do watching the film, but with today you die, i feel that doing so would be a criminal waste of my time.so here is a five minute rant about how bad this film is.there was a time in the mid-80s when a single look from steven seagal was enough to crack your ribs; a full on scowl could knock you off your feet. if he actually got a hold of you, he would snap you like a twig.these days, although he is still capable of doing considerable damage, he no longer looks the part. he's gone to seed and just doesn't know when to call it quits. he walks like he's dumped in his pants yet somehow still manages to look constipated, and he has put on weight. his trademark long ponytail has gone, but his hair still looks stupid. how this man keeps on working in the movie industry is beyond me.today you die is the usual seagal mix of bone crunching fights, car crashes, gun battles and pyrotechnics. seagal mumbles his way through the dull script, delivering his lines with zero enthusiasm or believability. in this third-rate action flick, he plays harlan banks a thief trying to go straight, who is conned into partaking in a $20,000,000 robbery. he gets caught, goes to jail, escapes, and seeks revenge. yawn.there are some pretty good car chases and gun fights which intersperse the boring stuff (of which there is a lot), but reading other comments on imdb has revealed that these were actually borrowed from other better movies. seagal is also body-doubled an awful lot in this one.seagal turns in one of the most dreadful performances of his careerand that's saying something, considering the lousy 'acting' in some of his recent efforts. most hilarious is his totally embarrassing attempt at ebonics (african american street slang). 'i da man, fo' sho'no, actually steven, you sound like an arse! with a ridiculous script and plot lines that go nowhere, this film is a waste of time, money and effort. and the final moment, where harlan banks saves a children's home from closure is enough to make you blow chunks.damn, i just looked at the clock. i was enjoying trashing this steaming pile of dreck so much, i went way over my five minutes. it's time to post this comment and get to watching something decent.

i ran across this movie on a local tv channel last night. frankly, i have never heard about this movie before. simply, i lost track of seagual's recent movies, for each one is worst than the previous one. here, again we have a dull seagal as if he was insisted by his girlfriend to make this movie and he accepted forcefully. the plot is ridiculous, acting is below zero, and there is no single aspect the movie is not falling apart. i simply don't have any idea why seagal did this movie. man, it is even worst than "out for a kill"! if you watch this movie you will start feeling sorry for seagal. he seems to be running out of ideas, enthusiasm and money. avoid this movie and do something worthwhile.

ho hum. just another flick with steven seagal pretending to be some spiritual being, but bashing heads and killing like it was nothing. he, of course, justifies it in the end by donating the money to an orphanage., how sweet. lay the world to waste and we'll ignore it if you take care of a little girl. jeesh! this time, he is partnered with ice cool (anthony 'treach' criss). gotta have someone to lay all those cringe-inducing lines on, man, and there are plenty. the dialog is pure crap.they go after bad guys nick mancuso and kevin tighe, two people that were born to play the scumbags.he's squeezing mari morrow and impressing soap star sarah buxton. how cute.i guess if you gotta have some july force excitement, this may suffice. if nothing else it will help you get your degree in seagalology.

this feels very stilted and patronizing to a great extent. the whole plot is extremely forced - especially the "gallant" effort to save the college from ruin, and the moralistic overtone (especially by the leading lady) grates a bit.but there are one or two comic moments that do help relieve the boredom, and the dancing is quite fun (especially for alleged amateurs - ha, ha!)the shop proprietor and the young guy doing spectacular tap dancing were particular highlights. and i liked peter hayes impressions of charles laughton and ronald coleman as well.

the stage star grace hayes stars in this obscure little film. after years of being on the stage, she is going to visit a small college town to check up on her son who is being raised by his grandfather. the kid doesn't know who his mother is and when she sees him in a local malt shop, he's a boorish jerk. part of the problem is that he is a college clown the other part is that he's really spoiled.interestingly, it turns out that mom is really quite wealthy and has been not only funding her son's life but is a hefty contributor to the college. so, she has the idea of forcing the young man to mature. she talks to the man who's raising peter and has his allowance cut off completely--hoping he'll rise to the occasion. it also turns out that she puts the screws to the school because she thinks all these kids need to stop playing around and be more responsible.now here's where it gets pretty dumb. to show that they know the value of hard work, she hires a bunch of them to sing and dance at the malt shop she just purchased. talk about contrived!! what happens next is like a long and not particularly good talent show or perhaps a poor man's version of a judy garland/mickey rooney musical! i'd suggest the kids try to do something else to earn money...or perhaps sing and dance until people pay them to stop! i know i would pay them.considering that the talent is far from talented, peter is a bad actor and his change from lout to responsible adult is almost instantaneous, the whole thing is a bit hard to take. not a very good film by any sane standard, this is an obscure film that should have stayed obscure! by the way, it is interesting that ms. hayes' son in the film, peter, is actually her real life son. the only problem with that is that peter lind hayes is a truly awful actor. he's not handsome enough to be a leading man and he comes off as either dull and uninteresting or downright obnoxious. in particular, all the stupid impressions he does are really bad and he has the charisma of the gelatin that you scrape off spam. despite this terrible performance, he did go on to have a reasonably successful acting career. who would have believed it if you'd seen him in zis boom bah--because here, he's about as welcome as the bubonic plague!!

oh gawd. i want to time travel back to monogram studios and throttle someone in their 2 room front office for this sloppy musical. it is one watt above flat-lining for 60 of its 61 minutes and then actually shows (for the one thin minute, spread in milli-second blips across the hour) that there is real life talent being badly photographed.i just don't see the point of going to some trouble to actually make this film that could easily be energetic and actually funny and allow lethargy to be the main thing on view. the weird storyline shows cranky vaudeville trouper grace hayes bulldozing her blowsy way into a college where her rat-bag son is rich college clown. she's gonna fix his playboy ways, no matter what.her real life son (weird looking) peter hays plays her screen son. his real life wife plays her secretary. talk about nepotism. i suspect this talent package was almost the raison d'etre for monogram financing this back-lot musical produced by resident schlockmeister extraordinaire sam katzman. as with other monogram musicals it just looks more like a reason to film recent new furniture purchases and light fittings in order to show off to other studios that monogram pictures are 'lavish' in their b grade ways. have a ghastly look at swing parade of 1946 for genuine evidence of this: they just constructed this gigantic nightclub set then found an excuse to film actors and musicians running all over it. story? none. anyway zis boom bah is more bah than boom. where was gale storm and mantan mooreland when monogram really needed them? probably standing at the boom gate of prc pictures wondering if it looked safe to enter there. junior jive hepster roland dupree springs to life to rappety tap his teen legs around two wobbly dance numbers, especially in the 'big show' finale set in the new and expanded malt shoppe/club set. the usual crumpled curtains are loosely hanging on the back wall, and the stage set of mis matched drapery even has one dark main rag that is yanked back and forth as each amateur sequence elbows past the previous one. the chorus girls and their very plain looking partners in this finale just look like monogram office staff borrowed (from typing and carpentry) for the morning of filming. they have absolutely no dance talent and are so ordinary on screen... all the girls look like they are all called joyce. there is even a costume calamity where they wear frilly hot-pants...on one leg only. it is all so awful and crummy...and actually annoying when one more tweak up by all concerned would result in zis being actually fun. the one strangely interesting thing is the dialog delivery between grace and her son/daughter in law: it is so casually delivered that it actually works in spite of the script and logic. she has a very life like presence which is the only thing that allows the ridiculous story to be slightly compelling. the dupree kid is the real star. he can actually do something...in spite of looking like a tubby liberace tap dancing teen... you read that right.

having some idle time before going to work, i looked at my "50 movie pack comedy classics" dvd collection and picked the most obscure title in the pack: zis boom bah starring a forgotten grace hayes. "classics" is obviously the operative word here since most of the titles i've never heard of and i suspect they're all in the public domain. anyway, this movie also stars her son peter lind and his wife mary healy (who i just found out is a new orleans native from the state i live in, louisiana) with benny rubin as a malt shop proprietor and huntz hall, taking a break from the east side kids, as peter's buddy. the plot, about a vaudeville mother trying to turn her rich carefree son into a responsible one with him unaware of who she is, is for the birds and doesn't have many funny scenes though i did like peter's celebrity impersonations and his dance with hall in drag. and the songs and dances are entertaining in themselves. rubin, however, is all over the place with his confusion of the american vernacular of the time and almost everything concerning him makes no sense whatsoever (though i did like his funny dance). since this was only 61 minutes that i'm sure played on the lower-half of the double feature bill, i'll be charitable and give this one a 3 for the few entertaining bits that i mentioned enjoying.

the main portion of this lightweight musical story is located at fictional midwick college, which peter kendricks (peter lind hayes) attends due to the largesse of stage actress grace hayes, his real-life mother who fills the same role here, and who manages to supply his love interest through her secretary mary (healy) who is his real-life wife. drably directed from a weak script, and additionally hampered by excessive cutting and poor editing, this film does provide some treasures among its eight songs, including the title number, and has nice turns by soprano healy, benny rubin as a snack shop proprietor, and the dynamic tap dancing roland dupree.

yes, it's true that it was jessica alba who leads me to this movie, because without her, i should have never pick it.but, i find it long, dull and above all, unoriginal. all along, i thought that the story was full of clichés and the directing very boring. so it was a surprise to see that the director and writer are the one and same person. i take notice to remember to avoid all his next movies.it's a pity because all good things were at hand: malaysia is a beautiful jungle, it was the british empire and the cast is wonderful: jessica knows how to open her soul and for one time, she has found an appropriate movie for this. bob hoskins shows a great experience and he should have won an award for this role.the only positive thing is that it makes me open a world-map to locate this island because if you guess it happens in south asia, you don't know where exactly! ah, the little plane flight with red lines in the indiana jones movie!!!

i just saw a terrible film called the sleeping dictionary. one reviewer on four word film review (www.fwfr.com) got it right right when he wrote, "from a to zzzzzzzzz." the story is about an english colonialist jerk that comes to malaysia to "civilize the savages" so to speak and ends up falling in love with his sleeping dictionary. a sleeping dictionary is a native malaysian prostitute fluent in english that services englishmen colonialists and teaches them her native language in return for ... well the movie never really makes that clear, but i can only assume he gives her money or something. needless to say, the movie focuses a lot more on the "sleeping" part than on the "dictionary" part of the job description. things get complicated for our young hero when the forbidden love affair gets compounded by her culture, his soap opera domestic situation, and his own boundless stupidity in every major decision he makes throughout the film.so yes, the movie has some major flaws, but on the other hand, it delivered exactly the two things i rented it for in the first place: a beautifully photographed exotic location, and an even more beautifully photographed and exotic woman that plays the sleeping dictionary, jessica alba. my friend told me that this crappy movie was her at her most beautiful and damn was he right. she's not a great actress, and doesn't quite pass for malaysian, and its pretty obvious that they use a body double for the nudity, but who cares? jessica alba has that rare face and figure that's more than just sexy, but also beautiful in the way that a vivaldi violin concerto or a rembrandt painting is.(p.s. sorry to all you feminists out there who discourage objectifying women, the "male gaze," etc. etc., but i hope you can understand that i mean no disrespect.)

based on a fairly bland "best seller," this film - like most other lifetime movies - played out more like a reenactment than an actual movie. the only difference here was that meredith baxter wasn't in it. the women in this don't age even over a span of like 20 years and the acting in general is pretty bad.the characters in this were all cliché and one-dimensional. the story was of the cheesy nature. i wouldn't recommend it, but it's the kind of thing that people who loved the book and people who watch that network all the time will think is great. i only watched it because my girlfriend wanted to see it so she wouldn't have to read the book her sister loaned to her. it wasn't made for someone like me - my girlfriend cried a little at the end though, so she didn't think it was as terrible as i did.

who is minding the store here? how could any producer/network executive/director let a crew stick the skeeziest fakest plastic palm trees in film history in the sands of a wintry canadian beach and try to fob it off on us as the tropics? those trees were to real palm trees what a pink tinsel k-mart christmas tree is to real fir. and who let dermot mulroney go in front of the camera with painted-on grey hair that wouldn't have passed muster in a high school play? and didn't any of the geniuses doing quality control on this thing think to correct the (excellent) canadian actor when he said gaz instead of gas? everybody involved with this plodding slug of a "movie"--writer, director, actors--has done not just good but brilliant work elsewhere. paced way too fast between events and deadly slow within them, devoid of any emotion except the obvious, expository and contrived--maybe this only seems like one of lifetime's worst movie because of all the red carpet hype with which it was presented. and i'm saying this as somebody who love lifetime. what gives, folks?all of that said, a certain actress's work at a certain critical turn in the movie (and if you've seen it you'll know exactly what i'm talking about) was so brilliant that the movie would have gotten a 10 from me if that was the whole movie. unfortunately it was only about five seconds of it.

the memory keeper's daughter in the form of a novel by kim edwards was a highly successful bestseller and probably was featured in more reading groups than any other novel during its circulation. so what happened when the novel became a made-for-television movie? perhaps it is the below mediocre screenplay (oops!, teleplay!) by john pielmeier that consistently galumphs along in an awkward pedestrian fashion removing all sense of credibility to the story. perhaps it is the cut and paste direction by mick jackson that misses the pacing and character delineation. perhaps it suffers from the cinematography of an uncredited source or the 'liquid tears' musical score by daniel licht. for whatever of these (or all of these) reasons, this novel-to-film survives because it does make a good case for educating the public about the capabilities of those born with down syndrome. and for that it is worthy of attention. dr. david henry (dermot mulroney), a successful orthopedic doctor, is married to the beautiful norah (gretchen mol) and their lives are becoming changed by their pregnancy. on a stormy winter night in kentucky norah goes into labor and the henry's rush to a nearby clinic where david delivers his wife (the doctor is caught in a snowstorm) with the assistance of his old friend, nurse caroline gill (emily watson). after the delivery of a perfect boy child (paul) norah continues to be in labor and (surprisingly...) delivers an unexpected (!) twin girl. david and caroline immediately recognize that the little girl (phoebe) is a 'mongoloid' (this is before the use of the term down syndrome) and david, having a history of losing a little sister because of a birth defect) decides to send phoebe to an asylum for the mentally challenged: caroline is to make the delivery and norah is told the second twin died at birth. caroline follows instructions, sees the conditions of the 'home' where phoebe is to be deposited, shrinks in horror, and decides to keep the child. aided by a friendly trucker, caroline changes her solitary existence and mothers phoebe, finding a new life in her trucker's pittsburgh. norah insists on a formal funeral for phoebe - a fact that deeply disturbs david's psyche, and the henry's life goes on with only the one child paul, leaving submerged pains about the lack of phoebe's presence. norah gifts david with a camera ('peoples lives are like a camera, that's where they live - in a room captured by a moment') and david becomes obsessed with photography. norah grieves, drinks, and loses david's attention, while david traces phoebe's existence with caroline - sending money and letters to pittsburgh. paul (tyler stentiford to jamie spilchuk) grows up, discovers his mother's infidelities and is angered about his father's lack of communication and understanding, and decides to fulfill his goal of becoming a musician, and off to juilliard he goes. meanwhile phoebe (krystal hope nausbaum) has matured into a very highly adapted young girl, and the manner in which the broken marriage of the henrys happens and the healing atmosphere of phoebe's and paul's lives coupled with the courage that has supported caroline gill's struggle to gain acceptance in the world for those born with down syndrome forms the conclusion of the film. the cast of well-known actors tries hard, but only emily watson is able to resurrect a credible character from this squishy script. jamie spilchuk gives evidence of a young actor with much promise. dermot mulroney and gretchen find it difficult to mold empathetic characters form the corny lines they are given to deliver. the film is a mess, but the message about acceptance of down syndrome children and adults is an important one. grady harp

great book, poorly done movie. cheesy performances and contrived situations make this movie a sentimental bore-fest. flat and uninspired work from most of the actors leaves this film in the after school special category. no doubt there is a lot of talent to be tapped in this cast and crew but something went horribly wrong the very talented gretchen mol attempts to pull this film out of the mire but even she can't seem to rise above the silly dialogue. feels like everyone just phoned it in. even the makeup (mulrooney ages 20 years over the course of the film) looks amateurish and crude. don't waste your time on this clunker.... go read the book.

this was the first chan film made by monogram. what a come down from fox values and standards! i was shocked when i saw my first monogram after seeing the great fox films. this is boring and uninspired with wild music playing as chan calmly walks across the street. chan is now working for the us secret service rather than the honolulu police department. he is assisted by benson fong, who plays no. 3 son tommy for the first time. he also has a daughter along, iris chan, played by marianne quon. mantan moreland also makes his debut as birmingham brown. he is a cab driver in washington, dc, here, rather than the later chauffeur to chan in the later films.

i'm sorry, perhaps this is part of the wave of praise for fireman since 911, perhaps it's an old fashioned story, perhaps it's not meant to knock your socks off but i'm sorry, this film is awful. as in the title, cliché 49, i think it has at least that many clichés. it's a dreary story (impressive managing to be dreary when there's dangerous fires and lives being saved) about a fireman. and his dreary life, told in a pointless, 'scene from now' flashback to the past style. we begin the film with the hero in peril in a collapsing burning building. the entire film is about trying to get us to love this guy so we squeeze a few tears out when he meets his end in the finale of the scene from the start of the film. i found it hard to care and wished he'd gone up in smoke earlier. clichés abound such as - death of best friend, love at first site, hazing in a new job, firstborn, a worried wife with a husband with a perilous job, a father figure boss/superior, 2.4 kids (well 2 but close enough), sacrificing your life to save others, awards for bravery....on and on. it's every fireman's life, every police officer, nurse, doctor in some way. it was lazy, if it was meant as a 'life flashing before his eyes' as he died, then god help the poor chap, i'm surprised he didn't suck in more smoke to go quicker. the flashbacks are mostly mundane and predictable, dully acted and with a soundtrack that could put the laughing cow out of business it was so cheesy, it actually sounded like muzak or copyright free elevator stuff!!! to be avoided at all costs unless you need something to watch with granny of a sunday evening. or maybe if your related to a firefighter - warning - your life will end horribly or you will be scarred for life if you are a brave fireman according to this movie. unless your john travolta (strange velcro style hair in this one!!)

if you pack all the clichés about city firefighters into 105 minutes; you have ladder 49.it has a story but is highly clouded by all the clichés. it turns it into movie that with every event; becomes so predictable it's not worth watching. there is no depth to the story and even the acting seems superficial.it looked like it wanted to be a tribute to firefighters but ended up being boring and pretentious. the parallel between jack morrison being fatally trapped beneath an inaccessible part of a building and firefighters being trapped beneath the rubble of the twin towers was all too obvious.it doesn't compare to movies like backdraft and certainly does not set an example for future movies about fire personnel.

in my opinion, the ending is what completely ruined the whole thing. the initial idea of having someone suddenly realize they were the son of god and the second coming was somewhat clever. people started to believe him and his friends became the new disciples. people went nutty, demons were possessing people, all kinds of fun. of course then it all went wrong. it was bad enough that they had to take on the impossible task of looking through a vast amount of writings to find the "third testament" in five days, but then at the end it became this ridiculous humanist fantasy. i won't spoil it, but i'll just say it comes off as if it were written by a teenager with a very limited knowledge of theology. i hear they are making an american feature version of this story, i just hope they change the eye rolling ending.

if the following sounds tempting, then by all means rush down to your local blockbuster and rent this movie post-haste:1. awful 60's hairstyles, from pathetic perms to dodgy ducktails.2. the worst child actor in the world ever, who does nothing but cry and say daddy in the most annoying voice imaginable.3. lots of stock footage of alligators and monkeys that doesn't mesh with the film. at all.4. stereotypical indians who use blowpipes and talk gobbledegook. oh, and it goes without saying they whoop around a campfire.5. hilariously fake plane crash mechanics where the cast actually throw themselves into the corners of the cardboard set.6. the exterior shots of 5, which look suspiciously like a toy jet on a string being led around a studio lit with blue light.7. terrible special effects which make the ones used in the first star trek series look cutting edge by comparison. ( special mention: the little boy's blond hair glowing. oh dear..) 8. laughable editing and continuity, where background items move between scenes, the soundtrack changes completely without any warning etc.9. not got enough money to hire a professional dancer? get any lady from off the street to prance about like an idiot! no-one will notice the difference! er..10. a 'thrilling' climax involving quicksand, snakes (more stuff from the archives) and a ton of fake blood. don't forget to put in a stupid 'tribal' sounding song either!the more sensible among you however, will wait for it's inevitable appearance on mst3k when this classic tv show is resurrected and then you can watch it in the spirit it was intended. any other kind of enjoyment to be derived from this crap is unthinkable.. not to mention unworkable. so don't even try it. 0/10

terror in the jungle is a real find. if you saw it, you're one of the few lucky ones. it's hilarious!the story is about an airplane crashing in the middle of the south american jungle. the crash scene has to be seen to be believed. everyone dies in the crash or they're subsequently eaten alive by crocodiles. only a young blonde boy survives. a nearby tribes brings the kid to their village and they (all males) venerate him because of his golden hair! i kid you not! at the end, there's a lot of wrestling between the natives and the man on the search for any survivors of the downed airplane. all the while, the kid sits on a throne and his blond hair is surrounded by a golden halo and he cries nonstop!! it's a hoot!!!very obscure and contains very questionable subtexts. a must if you're into obscure, it's-so-bad-it's-good movies.

thats what this movie really takes. a big piece of cheeze. this movie is about a sister and brother bonnie and clyde type of duo that creates their own party line in order to lure their victims in and trap them and kill them. but for what reason? just for the fun of getting away with it? in comes richard hatch who comes across as a wishy washy ladies man. a real bad version of a ladies man. and he gets involved with finding who's behind all the killings across la. he finally meets a teenager who helps him find the killer and rest is for your fun and amusement. but there are parts in this film that really get me going like the scene with lief garret dressed in his mothers wedding gown acting like a sissy in front of his sister telling her that he needs her and can't live without her and watching as she slaps him across the face dominateing him. i can't believe that was lief!!! well, i guess i could. but it's worth watching but only to see one of garrets worst films that he ever did.

yep, it's me again! mr 'i sit through crap so you don't have to'.what do you think this is about? could it possibly be about a woman who call a sex line and arrange to meet bachelors in a secluded area? then her cross-dressing boyfriend comes along and slits their throat with razor, before they make off together with his cash? wow, what a guess! and if i tell you that the cop who is put on the case is forced to team up with a sexy assistant da to nail these suckers, what conclusion will you come to? do you reckon the sexy da will go undercover wearing a flimsy red dress to an attempt to meet the drag queen, but then end up being kidnapped and having to be rescued by the maverick officer? (who has already handed in his gun and badge) zing! you get 10 points!frankly, this film bored me to tears. why do people insist on making this kind of rubbish? its a waste of our time, their time and yet they still carry on regardless.. filming a movie that no-one gives an iota about. if it has any redeeming features, there's the fact that it has some of the prettiest ladies i've seen in a motion picture for a while. i hope they spent what meagre wages they earned on plenty of botox and colonic irrigation. they'd look great on the cover of vogue, or perched on the top of a car in a bikini. they should just leave acting to the professionals (like shannon tweed).talking about future careers, i ran into the director the other day. he sure does whip up a tasty chicken burger meal. i must say too, that the uniform really does suit him. i asked him about 'party line', and his eyes went to the floor before he mumbled something about extra fries. oh well, guess it didn't quite work out. never mind, they're letting him take over the drive-thru tomorrow!! hurray!! 1/10

people call a 976 "party line" to talk dirty to strangers, and perhaps meet up for a sexual liason. a deranged, somewhat incestuous sister and occasional transvestite brother use the line to find people to kill, usually married men, but they don't discriminate! a pair of sixteen year old girls also call the line for fun, pretending to be older, of course. one of them works as a babysitter for a married man who's hot for her (or anyone).meanwhile, a vice cop is borrowed by homicide when he's the first to discover one of the siblings' victims. he's teamed with a female assistant of the district attorney.nothing too special here. richard roundtree has little more than a cameo as the police chief. one of the dirty-talking sixteen year olds is played by an actress who also voiced peanuts character peppermint patty! according to the imdb, the other died quite young, just several years after this movie: sad.

it is sad that some find this film worth watching. i am russian, and i am disgusted. there is nothing in this film that deserves praise, except cinematography. however, i am not one of those who find beauty in death or perversion. i think this film is poorly designed and directed. there is nothing more irritating and even enraging than shameless speculation in art (if you can call this garbage art). balabanov wanted to shock the viewers by pervasive evil, and he succeeded in creating a hopelessly dark film. but the biggest shock is balabanov's primitive directorial work. i would never advise any of my friends to watch it. huge disappointment!

while i agree with the previous post that the cinematography is good, i totally disagree with the rest: this is nothing more than a porno movie disguised as an artsy film. showing little boys naked is not art and amounts to child porn. steer clear of this dud. stupid is what this film is.

i understand the purpose of the director to tell stories that aren't stories, but the way he tried to show time passing by (the couple of joggers, who first appear jogging together, than jogging with a stroller (sic!), than the man alone...) and to link the "adventures" of the characters (the final scene, with the maid climbing a mountain seeing the big black guy on another cliff, and then seeing the boat with her former employer and saying "oh, a boat!") were awful. at the same time, i liked the way he portrayed the middle-high class, even in an excessive way. i think it is a lousy movie. if you want to watch it, do it as a film school student, trying to see technical aspects and issues. it will help a lot.

altioklar: master of the thieves. watch some movie, steal some parts of them, write a script... it must be very easy to be a director in turkey. i think altioklar watched "identity (2003)", "saw (2004)", a few series which is about crime, murder etc. then he said "eureka, eureka"(i have found it!) after that he wrote the script of the movie.you can guess the murderer at the beginning of the movie. it took only 10 minutes for me. he shouted "i'm the murderer, i'm the murderer.". there is no mystery. tamer karadagli is same(sux). exaggerated mimics, funny macho man. there is only one good thing in the movie. the performance of demet evgar is very good. you may see the movie just for that.

persuaded by the 7.0 points in imdb, which is pretty good, i decided to watch this movie. however, i found this movie quiet boring (about 2 hours) and full of clichés, a little girl getting multiple personalities after a childhood trauma etc. tamer karadagli is quiet funny in this movie, dialogs motions etc, you will have to see it, he is kinda the tough cop you see on american movies, perhaps copied too much. i would describe this movie as ordinary american thriller with a little bit of turkish touch, unfortunately yet again i'm convinced that comedies and dramas are the only genres worth watching in turkish cinema anyways i gave this movie a 4, its too boring and full of clichés

wow! after the first five minutes of watching this "film", i was quite tempted to put a bullet in my brain, and end my life. it's really hard to describe what exactly this film is about. i honestly don't know what kind of human being would even finance a piece of excrement. the film looks to have either been shot on video or 16mm. i normally don't have a problem with sov movies, are shoddily made 16mm films, but this was just so awful. and where did they find these "actresses"? i have seen some bad acting, but this takes the cake. watch the first 5 minutes and you'll see what i mean. bci entertainment should be boycotted for distributing this god awful sludge. this has to be the worst film i have ever had the displeasure of viewing. i want my 74 minutes back! if you are able to sit through the first 5 minutes, without either shooting your tv or committing mass homicide, then give a shot. after all, what have you got to lose?

i like bad films, but this thing is a steaming heap. from the shaky cameramen to the horrible sound and devastating acting, don't waste a second on this pile. fifth graders could have made a better film and first graders could have written a better script. want a real synopsis? ugly chicks in neon bikinis dancing for way too long. a disjointed plot made worse by hideous acting. the on-location sets weren't even passable. the church scenes take place in a dance studio, and oh yeah - what's with the two tap-dance numbers that come up out of the blue?oh, and the total number of naked breasts, which couldn't have even saved this film - 0. add this one to the trash heap.

ok - say some college in southern california has an movie making class. and some dudes were enrolled just to film girls, and they gave them a camera. and then they were drunk/stoned/ or just to plain stupid to actually use a camera, and they turned this in for their grade. and failed.that is my only explanation for this, this, thing. good god they left the date and time counter on during some of it. the picture started in new scene way before the sound, and forget about a plot. well apparently there was one and they had to tell you all about it once the 3 hour introduction sequence was finished. but i am glad they did because i never would have gotten it by watching this.stay away from this.

....is where i'm assuming this movie came from. i mean, i've watched plenty of b movies over the course of my young life so far, and i wouldn't even classify this as a b movie. i remember seeing films in my high school mass media class that surpass this one.so the premise is...a bunch of dancing numbers and goofy crap happens. women in bikinis, who aren't even that great looking to begin with, dance in the beginning and sing. guys with hairy chests show up and girls with fangs who are out in the sunlight. i mean, i can barely put together a cohesive sentence just thinking about this movie. according to most people on this site, manos the hands of fate and pod people are the worst movies (mst3k classics :-d)...i used to be one of them. then i saw this movie. usually i don't try to trash a movie too much, but the people who made this really do deserve it. it is that bad and that unbearable, and i'm assuming the director or an actor in the movie is the only person who rated this a ten.

move over manos. back off boogens. it doesn't take a baby genius to know that malibu beach vampires (mbv for the rest of this tome) is now and always will be (unless someone makes a sequel to zarkorr the invader) the worst film ever. the only horror in this thing is watching it. i wonder if this was an attempt for someone to meet babes by casting a movie. if this was the case, the babes ain't babes just like this ain't a movie. it's dreck. no wait. i dishonor the word dreck by calling it dreck. ulli lommel (of boogey man fame) would call it "uber dreck" or scheiße. it should be used to torture prisoners. if you find it on a shelf in a video store, back away from it quietly and notify the authorities.

if a copy of this movie fell into the wrong hands, the world would be in grave danger. i am a huge fan of "b" movies, and i have seen my share of bad ones, but there is not a letter in the alphabet that could adequately describe this rancid piece of solidified puke. this movie even surpasses the "so bad it's good" phase and goes straight on to the "so bad your world will seem a little less meaningful for having watched it" phase.it is hard to say what is more disturbing: .1. the fact that the people who wrote this thought their political satire (i use the term very, very, very loosely) was witty enough to film .2. they were able to find so many other people who agreed with them enough to work on this garbage for obviously little or no money .3. that someone actually thought it would be a good idea to pick this crap up for distribution on a horror anthology dvd.were i a weaker man, i most likely would have jammed grapefruit spoons into my eyes and then blindly flung myself to my death in oncoming traffic after watching this. as it stands though, i live ,but i am forever scarred by the experience.

wow -- this movie was really bad! you talk about formulaic, typical movie plot? watching this movie was like hitting my head repeatedly against a brick wall. the transitions kept trying to be cool but failed. the plot twist at the end, where we find out who the bad guy is was unexpected, but doesn't make much sense until his monologue. even then... the amount of gore in this movie doesn't help either. are all of those images necessary? my last complaint is about the plausibility of chunks of the movie. would the pd really send a lone officer into an unlit warehouse, subway tunnel, or wherever to find a body, when the location of the perp is unknown? and why does the romance at the end just kind of happen all of a sudden? it's like the writer was trying to fit in every hollywood cliche he could. don't waste your time seeing this piece of... something.

a formulaic story with all the tired cliches. i was shocked that the horrible script became a movie! what a waste! how many original scripts are scattered around without being produced?  at the climax i could predict what will happen in every single shot. oh, and don't even get me started about the idiotic sexual tension between the gorgeous female cop and the paralyzed cop who can barely move a finger. yeah right. i can buy that. what next? fingers porn?

i wouldn't recommend this to anyone, except cinema-goers who like to laugh at a film, not with it.quite a promising premise and set of actors get progressively worse over a film which ends with perhaps the worst ending ever seen in a film. i won't spoil it, but basically the most over-used set of movie cliches get done badly and half heartedly for the most disappointing last five minutes to any film, ever.the movie also includes the most cringe inducing scene ever, the attempt at on-screen chemistry between the two lead roles when we're presented with a close up of angela jolie stroking denzel washington's finger lovingly. it may be the only thing he could move, but quite why the viewer is treated to a zoom of washington's finger getting stroked amidst the kind of dimmed lights and music appropriate for a sex scene is beyond me. i laughed out loud and shook my head.the direction of the storyline borrows heavily from se7en, but here it is executed far more simplistically, and far too obviously. to call it a poor-mans se7en would be an understatement, this really is nothing more than a made for tv movie and even jolie and washington's best efforts can't convince that this is a box office film.

am i the only person who thinks that the entire forensics and scenes of crime community in the usa must detest this almighty slap in their faces. a rookie cop is first to a crime scene where her back up is so slow to respond that she has time to send the kid who found the body to the local store to buy a disposable camera. by the time he returns (still no senior cops, socos or other assistance for the lovely jolie - this is new york isn't it??) it has started raining and she gets to work photographing the evidence, only after she'd stood in front of an amtrak to stop it disturbing the scene.i want to know the name of that camera as the photographs were so incredibly detailed that no amount of zooming in distorted the images!! the horror continues:- not in the film itself (pretty ordinary i'm afraid) but in the lincoln rhyme character as played by mr washington. this man is a highly dedicated forensic crime scene examiner with years of experience who, instead of the highly trained but invisible local crime scene examiners, entrusts the work to an untrained cop, a rookie cop, who proceeds to find the very obviously placed clues and move them before photographing them thus contaminating every item and making dna profiling well nigh impossible. now that was a bright idea eh? i know one should be able to suspend disbelief to a degree but those who say this film is intelligent must have entirely disengaged their ability to think in order to find this film believable.i have given this film 4/10 for the superb acting of denzel washington and for miss jolie's lips which are the only items requiring my disbelief to be suspended!

the bone collector is set in new york city & starts as one of the world's foremost criminologist's & crime scene experts lincoln rhyme (denzel washington) is involved in an accident which leaves him a bedridden quadriplegic. jump forward four years & alan (gary swanson) & his wife lindsay rubin (olivia birkelund) are kidnapped, soon after new york cop amelia donaghy (angelina jolie) is called to a crime scene & finds the buried & mutilated body of alan. amelia notices some unusual crime scene evidence & makes a note of it which impresses rhyme when he is asked to work on the case, he quickly realises the evidence are in fact cryptic clues to the whereabouts of lindsay. having cracked the clues the cops get there too late to save her but this is just the beginning as a sadistic serial killer continues to kill & leave forensic clues for rhyme & the police...directed by phillip noyce i watched the bone collector last night & i have to say it's one of the worst big budget post the silence of the lambs (1991) & se7en (1995) serial killer thrillers i have seen, in fact it makes friday the 13th (1980) look sophisticated & realistic! the script by jeremy iacone was based on the book by jeffery deaver & is so poor on so many levels i hardly know where to begin. for a start it takes itself deadly seriously & that makes all the other flaws seem twice as bad. the character's are truly awful & i didn't believe any of them were actual human beings. first we have lincoln rhyme who is paralysed from the neck down & there's just not a lot the script can do with him, in fact he quite literally can't do anything but lie in bed for the whole film. he is seemingly impressed with amelia because she stopped a train & thought a fresh footprint near a murdered person might be of relevance, i'm not being funny here but wouldn't any cop realise a footprint near a murder victim might be of some relevance? why is he so impressed with her? then there's capatin cheney who is not only unlikable & shouts at everyone for no apparent reason but is so incompetent that he failed to connect several murders committed in a short space of time where each victim had sections of flesh & skin surgically removed from their bodies, how exactly did this guy get to be a police captain? then there's the killer whose motives are less than plausible, are you trying to tell me they devised an intricate plan to murder at least seven people because they spent six years in jail for something they actually did? if they wanted revenge on rhyme why did they kill all those other people who had no connection to anything, i could maybe just about buy someone wanting revenge against the guy who put them away but not to kill several other people who have no connection to themselves, the intended target rhyme anything else. also after devising an intricate plan to kill these people & get away with it they suddenly turn into the most stupid person in history as despite holding a large knife & being able to walk & use their arms they are actually defeated & nearly killed by a quadriplegic who has no movement in his body below his neck! how did that happen? i should also mention amelia who is a terrible character, she actually buys her own camera to take crime scene photo's & shoots rats for no apparent reason.besides some of the worst written character's ever the story & plot isn't much better we never find out why the killer is using the bone collector book as inspiration we never find out why the killer was taking strips of flesh from his victims. it's never explained why a rookie cop like amelia is allowed to enter crime scenes even before the proper forensic teams. there is no reason given for why the killer chooses his victims. also the killers clues are a little obscure aren't they? i mean a bloody animal bone & shaved rat hair? logically how does someone go from a bone & rat hair to the exact pinpoint location of the next victim & has the whole of new york to choose from? there's some nonsense about a bird that sits on rhymes window ledge which is just totally random & at almost two hours the bone collector is really slow going. there is so much wrong with the bone collector & it all comes down to one of the worst scripts ever, it's atrocious on all levels & has zero credibility. apparently angelina jolie has stated that she shot nude scenes for this film but they were cut because they were felt to be too distracting.with a supposed budget of about $48,000,000 the bone collector is well made with good production values & that hollywood gloss about it. i also must add right now that i think angelina jolie gives one of the worst performances i have ever seen, i think she is absolutely terrible in this. denzel washington just sort of lies there really, queen latifah is awful & even michael rooker can't do much as he is stuck with a clichéd & one dimensional character.the bone collector has to be one of the worst hollywood films i have seen in a while, i saw it for free on telly last night & i still feel cheated & ripped-off. there are just so many things to poke holes at it's silly, embarrassingly awful or should that be awfully embarrassing? works either way to be honest...

let me begin by saying that i adore the book and loved the a&e miniseries. i was hoping to love this film, and i was absolutely willing to allow it a moderate degree of artistic license in interpreting and abbreviating the actual story. however, this film scarcely resembles the original book. if only "the names had been changed to protect the innocent," i would have possibly enjoyed the movie as simply an entertaining, if inaccurate, period piece.unfortunately, putting the name "mr. darcy" on a character who is emotional and weak, giving the name "elizabeth bennett" to a reckless, snippy, often teary-eyed hoyden who cares nothing for the rules of society, and making "mr. bingley" a wide-eyed dimwit absolutely destroyed the idea that the director had ever read jane austen's original story. there are some really stellar moments in this movie -- perhaps a total of 10 minutes are truly excellent. charlotte's explanation of why she accepted mr. collins' proposal begins beautifully. she is 27 years old (quite near the hopeless-spinster age in those times), she is becoming a burden on her family, and she is not romantic. she only wants "a comfortable home." however, the beautiful dialogue is ruined when she blubbers, "don't you judge me, elizabeth. don't you dare judge me!" and runs off in tears. later, you see charlotte kowtow to lady catherine de bourgh, which was not at all in her character as described in the book. another good moment is when darcy catches elizabeth in his home while she is touring the area with her aunt and uncle. it was well done in the a&e series, but the film version with keira knightley made the audience feel acutely how very humiliating that moment must have been for elizabeth. very nice.the ending also illustrated a level of affection between elizabeth and darcy that was not shown as obviously in the miniseries. i actually appreciated that scene, simply because i like to see a happy ending, rather than just know that it took place. altogether, though, this movie eliminated the subtlety that was such an integral part of austen's pride and prejudice. the characters speak in a jarring combination of austen's dialogue verbatim and modern phrases and colloquialisms. information that was only alluded to or suggested in the original work is blatantly stated in this version. yes, time was a concern. it's only a short movie, yada yada. but turning a complex, beautiful book into a superficial love story is ridiculous. some have commented that they loved the moment when darcy first sees elizabeth, because it is so obviously a case of "love at first sight." love at first sight? huh? one of the best aspects of the book is that elizabeth is not supposed to be a traditional beauty, and darcy comes to love her for her wit and liveliness ... he literally "loves her for her mind." this version also had a moment (during darcy's first proposal) when the two are yelling furiously at each other, while leaning closer ... and closer ... and almost kissing ... but they suddenly step apart. ugh! what a sad cliché. they're angry and disgusted with each other, but so attracted that it doesn't matter that (at the time) they don't even like each other? ridiculous! the characterizations were all so far removed from those described in the book that it really was like a different story. mr. bennet was dour, elizabeth usually acted just as silly as her younger sisters, charlotte was emotional, somewhat unintelligent and desperate for a home of her own -- unlike the intelligent, slightly scheming woman with an abundance of common sense who is portrayed in the novel. jane and elizabeth's relationship is merely topical, instead of the deep-rooted love and admiration they are supposed to have for each other. all this i could have accepted as merely poor interpretations of the novel, but i refused to accept all that in addition to the many, many historical inaccuracies. miss bingley walked around scarcely clothed (her dress looked like what the others would wear as tight undergarments). elizabeth walked to netherfield with her hair down and allowed to fly all over. the family lazed about one morning, though mornings were supposed to be reserved for calling on acquaintances (or being called on at your own home). elizabeth walked outside barefoot in her nightgown. and in a really appalling scene, bingley walked into jane's bedroom and conversed with her (and sounded like an idiot) when she was ill. most people would feel these are minor points, but i simply wanted either a.) an historically accurate film, or b.)an accurate representation of the characters in the novel. the director/writer/whoever sacrificed accuracy, subtlety and a good story for a trite tale of love at first sight. i can concede that those who have not read the book or who are not familiar with the social conventions of the time could very easily like this movie, and there is nothing wrong with that. i simply couldn't overcome my desire to see a film that involved more than just two pretty faces.

i think it is saying something that the bollywood "bride and prejudice" stayed more faithful to the source material than this 2005 hollywood version did. i also laughed more at the bollywood version. (mr. kholi? priceless!) if you have read the book or seen the 1995 bbc version (and liked them), you will be in for a nasty surprise going in to this film then. my friend however, who had seen neither, was mildly amused by the film. if you are a jane austen purist though, or even a film-goer who dislikes historical inaccuracies, it will be painful to sit through this.ugh, the script. the script was the biggest problem. i imagine the actors wouldn't have fared half so badly if they'd had a decent script, perhaps penned by somebody who actually loved austen's work.what travesties were committed? well, you'll be forced to endure such incredulous lines as "don't you dare judge me, lizzy!" and "leave me alone for once in your lives!". not only are such lines far from anything that could come from jane austen's eloquent pen, but can anyone honestly believe words like that spilling from the mouth of a genteel young lady from the regency era? the usage of modern colloquialisms is one of the many irritating ways that the screenwriter butchers the book. the writer also decided to give characters lines that, in the book, were said by a completely different characters and all for no apparent purpose. worse of all, when they do try to stick a bit closer to the book's writing, the screenwriter has a nasty and unnecessary habit of rearranging austen's phrases and substituting awkward synonyms for her already perfect words. it was as if the screenwriter sat down with the book in one hand and a thesaurus in the other when writing the script. stick to austen's words; she did it better than you! i assume all of this was done in a "revisionist" spirit and in an effort to distance this film from the iconic 1995 bbc version. however, for me, it also made a travesty of the true spirit of austen's most beloved work.the casting did have potential, though it was quickly dashed away once the script kicked in. but keira, giggling excessively and baring your crooked teeth does not equal charm and vivacity! and i think mr. mcfayden, though i find him tolerably handsome enough, misread his script and was under the impression he was playing heathcliff and not the formidable mr. darcy. i really did enjoy brenda blethyn, kelly reilly and the actor who played mr. collins. their interpretations were really rather refreshing.oh, but donald sutherland! somebody described his performance as seeming like a hobo who had accidentally wandered onto the movie set and i must say it is an apt description. and can somebody tell me why they fashioned wickham after legolas? though he was in the movie for under two minutes, i daresay, and without his impressive archery skills to perk up the movie.on a wardrobe note, i would kill for miss bingley's dresses because they were sumptuous and would fit in more with the modern century. (a sleeveless regency evening gown? please! more versace than austen, that is sure) and poor keira, all of the budget went to her salary and not her wardrobe! oh, and i'm sure they eventually caught the bastard who stole the one hairbrush from the movie set. unfortunately, they didn't catch him soon enough to comb the actresses' tresses before filming rolled.in short, with this new hollywood version, bid adieu to austen's eloquence, subtlety and wit because you'll be getting the complete opposite.

from the film's first shot - keira knightley as elizabeth bennet wandering reading through a field at dawn, thus invoking all the clichés cinema has developed to address the phenomenon of the strong-minded rebellious female character in period drama - i knew i was in for something to make me want to kill myself.joe wright seemed not only to have not read the book, but to be under the regrettable misapprehension that what he was filming was not in fact jane austen's subtle, nuanced comedy of manners conducted through sparkling, delicate social interaction in eighteenth century english drawing-rooms, but a sort of u-certificate wuthering heights. thus we were treated to every scene between elizabeth and darcy taking place outside for no apparent reason, in inappropriately rugged scenery and often in the pouring rain. not to mention that jane austen, and in particular p & p, is not about passion, sexual tension or love. it's about different strategies of negotiating the stultification of eighteenth century society. which was completely ignored, so that the bennets' house was a rambunctious, chaotic place where everybody shouts at once, runs around, leaves their underwear on chairs, and pigs wander happily through the house; the society balls become rowdy country dances one step away from a matrix reloaded style dance-orgy; and everybody says exactly what they think without the slightest regard for propriety.the genius of jane austen lies in exploring the void created by a society in which nobody says what they think or mean because of an overwhelming regard for propriety, and the tragic predicaments of her characters arise from misunderstandings and miscommunications enabled by that speechless gap. so both the brilliance of jane austen and the very factor that allows her plots - particularly in this film - to function was completely erased. subtlety in general was nowhere int his film, sacrificed in favour of an overwrought drama which jarred entirely with the material and the performances.it was so obviously trying to be a *serious* film. the humour - which is pride & prejudice, both austen's methodology and her appeal - was almost entirely suppressed in favour of all this po-faced melodrama, and when it was allowed in, was handled so clumsily. pride & prejudice is a serious narrative which makes serious points, yes, but those serious points and weightier themes are not just intertwined with the humour, they are embedded in it. you can't lose jane austen's technique, leaving only the bare bones of the story, and expect the themes to remain. not even when you replace her techniques with your own heavy-handed mystical-numinous fauxbrow cinematography.elizabeth bennett is supposed to be a woman, an adult, mature and sensible and clear-sighted. keira knightley played the first half of the film like an empty-headed giggling schoolgirl, and the second half like an empty-headed schoolgirl who thinks she is a tragic heroine. elizabeth's wit, her combative verbal exchanges, her quintessential characteristic of being able to see and laugh at everybody's follies including her own, her strength and composure, and her fantastic clear-sightedness were completely lost and replaced with ... what? a lot of giggling and staring into the distance? rather than being able to keep her head when all about her were losing theirs, she started to cry and scream at the slightest provocation - and not genuinely raging, either; no, these were petulant hissy fits. and where the great strength of austen's elizabeth (at least in austen's eyes) was her ability to retain integrity and observance while remaining within the boundaries of society and sustaining impeachable propriety, knightley's elizabeth had no regard whatsoever for convention. furthermore, she seemed to think that wandering around barefoot in the mud in the eighteenth century version of overalls established her beyond doubt as spirited and strong-minded, and therefore nothing in the character as written or the performance had to sustain it. an astonishingly unsubtle and bland performance. in which quest for blandness and weakness, she was ably matched by matthew macfayden.donald sutherland as mr bennet seemed weak, ineffectual and permanently befuddled without the wicked sense of humour and ironic detachment at the expense of human relationships that makes mr bennet so fascinating and tragic. his special bond with lizzie, as the only two sensible people in a world of fools, was completely lost, not least because both of them were fools in a world of fools, and that completely deprived the end of the film of emotional impact. mr bingley was no longer amiable and well-meaning to the point of folly, but was played as a complete retard for cheap laughs, and the woman who was playing jane was so wildly inconsistent that she may as well not have tried to do anything with the character at all. the script veered wildly between verbatim chunks of jane austen - delivered with remarkable clumsiness - and totally contemporaneous language which would not be out of place in a modern day romantic comedy.just get the bbc adaptation on dvd and save yourself the heartache.

maybe if you've never read any english literature or only ever watched the hollywood version of any book you might find merit in this awful film. it has the directorial and scripting skill of shoreditch. the bbc 1995 adaptation is both very enjoyable and close to the book and captures the atmosphere between elisabeth and darcy very well.the characters in this production are badly miscast, sutherland as bennet seems a total buffoon. bingley likewise acts the fool and it is imcomrepnsible that he my be a friend of darcy. i can't imagine how judi dench could have accepted the role, maybe she thought it was a surreal comedy version.quotes from the book are thrown in out of context. huge chunks are missing, the important episode with wickham is glossed over.mr collins is however very good, and towers above the other members of the cast.the only good thing is we didn't pay to see it. wait for the dvd and use to keep a table from wobbling.

sorry to say but was disappointed in the film. it was very very rushed, as i suppose you can understand a movie length version of pride & prejudice would be and i felt that a lot of the major scenes were glossed over just to get through the story. as the movie is so rushed, unfortunately you don't get to really know about and feel for each of the characters much at all. not only that, this movie is boring. i say that with a capital b. 1/3 of the way through i started yawning and couldn't wait for the movie to be over. as i have read the book and watch the bbc version, i knew how many scenes had to go, before i could finally leave the cinema. mr darcy whoever he is in this movie, definitely can't act. he looks also too young to play mr darcy. every word that comes out of his mouth is rushed like he needs to get through the script or something. where is the build up? at first, he seems confused with everything. he is just bizarre! it all looks put on. was trying not to compare to the colin firth version but if you love that version, you will most likely be disappointed anyway.the costumes are absolutely shocking. where are the corsets? i know elizabeth is poor, but i think she still knows how to dress as some sort of ladylike fashion, and hasn't been brought up in a squaller. her dresses indicates she might be the poorest peasant in all of england.i didn't agree with a couple of scenes in the movie in the fact, that i don't think it would be considered proper in that society for men to do such things, honestly mr bingley who has wealth should know better. there is some things that are said that sound too modern for the period this movie is set in, and not at all like jane austen. bingley's character is shockingly donee, to me he behaves like a simpleton, not a character to like and respect. what about that laugh of his!!! i wickham hardly has a presence and mr & mrs hurst and a couple of other characters have no presence at all. keira did okay, but it just ain't the same.

i went to see suspecting i would hate it, i did. everything about it was wrong; it was like they were filming a different book. granted the locations and houses very lovely (if not a little miscast-yes even the house were wrong for their parts) keira was too modern, dull and frankly i found it unpleasant to watch her. were everyone else sees darcy as a sex god the writer of this saw him as sexually frustrated and inadequate. bingley was stupid and dippy (he isn't meant to be) and the bennett's were shown to be destitute and for some unknown reason farmers, this is incorrect and ludicrous. the very idea that mr bennett would answer the door in his night gear with the rest of the family dressed in their underwear to in the middle of the night is stupid. they had servants. mr collins was not repulsive and greasy merely stupid and obnoxious, georgina darcy was ugly and old and miss bingley wore a sleeveless dress, what! as if! it is historically inaccurate and even the ending is unsatisfying. i could go on for days. i hated it so much as not only was it nothing like the book but i fear that for many people it will be their fist experience of this great novel and it will give them the worst possible idea of it. the bbc version is so superior it's not even funny and everything about this version is an insult to its memory. in short if you must see it be sure you have read the book first or seen the bbc version other wise you will be lead done the deluded road that this is what it's like, which its not!

if you have never heard of jane austen, seen the original movie or the 1995 bbc adaptation, or even seen a pop up version of the book, then this farcical attempt to show this classic love story may be considered vaguely endurable.from the opening scene, this film must be remembered for its awful acting, abominable miscasting and complete lack of the classic wit of jane austen.whoever decided to cast actors (with the exception of the excellent judi dench) who have obviously never heard of jane austen, let alone read her, should be punished! keira knightley grimaces and grins through every scene, and came across as being so obnoxious that no-one would want to marry her! darcy looked as if he was trying to remember his lines throughout the whole film and the rest of the bennet girls were interchangeable in their lack of portraying their characters as they were originally written.this version failed to show the proper pride and prejudice that both darcy and elizabeth suffered from and, at the end of the longest two hours of my life, who cared whether they got together or not! absolutely abysmal - even the too few minutes of judi dench cannot save this rubbish. i cannot think of anything good to say about this film apart from that it eventually ended!

well wright may have made a gritty depiction of life around 1800 - as he so repeatedly and anally goes on about because of when it was written as opposed to published - but it is his not austen's and shouldn't claim to be an adaptation.mrs bennett looks like a rural washerwoman. this is a pampered woman - they have servants (remember the book scene with the servant dressing the hair, etc)? but wright portrays her with rough reddened skin all down her chest, rough hands and working in the kitchen. and the pigs wandering through! if he wants bucolic, he should try tess.mr bennett - the script makes too cuddly and modern and ignored the weakness in him. the scene where he stops mary playing is supposed to make you cringe - not pass in seconds. if it doesn't - don't include it.macfadyen is very weak in the part and seems to be doing some kind of pride by numbers acting. the first proposal he looks like a nervous schoolboy rather than a man overcoming his pride to make a proposal beneath his station. most of his lines, he could as well be reading a shopping list.lydia is awful. completely over the top with excessive shrieking and skipping. indeed, knightley plays elizabeth more like the giggling inane character lydia actually is in the book, at times.and elizabeth. half the time knightley is, clearly, mimicking ehle's voice and intonation - close your eyes to see what a copy it is. and in her role you see wright's major error - there is no prejudice.from the first encounter with darcy she clearly fancies him. when he comments to bingley on the attractiveness of the women in the hall she initially looks hurt - not shocked and affronted. the latter should set up the prejudice side of things. and when she and 'caroline' are prancing round the room she comes across like a tease, obviously all over him. and by virtually cutting out wickham you don't get elizabeth invested enough there to set up the prejudicial aspects falling out of that relationship.and apparently it is caroline not miss bingley. and mr bingley happily wanders into jane's bedroom. and and and - wright can boast about how great he is with period all he wants. but a few panorama shots of rural life (which show the preference for hardy) don't excuse him the glaring blunders all over the place.the cinematographer - who clearly wants awards - should have been reined in. he veered between bronte and hardy throughout the film - and wasn't the last proposal shots/lighting from tess? the need to see darcy walk along through the 'scape with unkempt shirt was just dumb. but most importantly - when going between those 2 very different landscapes they forget the most important one - austen. (she'd have laughed out loud at the elizabeth = sad, therefore = rain, running through to picturesque folly, wet darcy rubbish).i admit i found it impossible the watch the film without using the book as context. i was prepared to give it some leeway as it had to provide the story in a short space of time. but to forget fully one half of the core of the book in prejudice and darcy to continually look more constipated than prideful, made it almost unwatchable. i could only see it as a mess with generally poor performances (when knightley wasn't aping ehle she was gurning or skipping or both and only calmed down a couple of times to indicate she does have some promise - but faffing about on swings to convey emotion isn't a substitute for a poor script and poor direction) - although for some it was simply a case of bad script.tom holland alone would escape censure. while he toned down the comic aspects of collins, he did turn in a very interesting approach. dench does superbly the schtick she can do in her sleep whether it be here or in oscar wilde - but this was supposed to be lady catherine de bourgh not lady bracknell. she was just a little too sane.the shortened length could have been handled by a competent screenwriter, surely? not characters filling in story gaps and helping along the audience all over the place. elizabeth couldn't have come up with the £10k figure. and while they wanted to cut time with her learning of darcy's involvement in wickhams marriage the lines didn't fit with lydia. it was the worst case of incongruous exposition in the piece.it really is appalling stuff. anyone who reviews it saying it works well in the context of the book is someone i frankly don't believe has read or understood the characterisations in the thing. wright seems to think his characters are in the 1990s not the 1709s from their behaviour. i'm not convinced he has read the book - he certainly doesn't understand it. he doesn't understand austen's acerbic wit or lightness of touch - he certainly made a dull plodding film out of it.what is possibly worse was the sad pathetic need of the chick lit lovers to need the 'i love you, i love yous' all over the place so they can sigh and get off on it. the fact that it has no place in a work by austen is apparently irrelevant.anyone who reviews it as a film alone? well, more difficult for me except i would note the poor acting, the weak darcy, and the gurning skipping inane irritation of the whole thing. if you are going to adapt you can change a lot - but if it loses the spirit and key motivations, then don't insult the book by taking it's title.

this film is one of the worst adaptations of pride and prejudice ever filmed and if jane austen were alive, she would demand that her name be removed from the film. austen's novel is only superficially a story of the development of true love between elizabeth bennet and fitzwilliam darcy. it is also a commentary on the class structure of regency britain. this film focuses only on the love story, thereby disappointing viewers who hoped it would do justice to the novel.there are numerous problems with the historical accuracy of the film. in the film, the dance at which darcy snubs elizabeth is not the refined dancing done by the gentry, to which the bennet, lucas, bingley, and darcy families belong, but is rather the dancing of the lower classes. the gentry would not have been dancing as if they were at a peasant barn dance. there are costume and hair problems, too. the custom of the period required married women to wear white cloth hats to cover their hair and for women to wear bonnets when outdoors. women of the regency period were not so liberated as to forego the bonnet requirements in public. the worst historical inaccuracy is the early morning meeting of elizabeth (in her nightgown and coat) and mr. darcy (sans cravat and vest) at which they admit their love for each other. this is an unforgivable liberty with the novel. no respectable young woman or gentleman would venture out of doors in such a state of undress or seek to meet someone of the opposite sex at such an early hour. but the worst thing of all with this film is the mangling of austen's dialogue and the atrocious modern dialogue. austen's dialogue needs no assistance from a writer who thinks he/she can write like austen. the writer of the non-austen dialogue not only lacks austen's talent but also has no feel for austen's style. the juxtaposition of the two styles is jarring.as for the acting, the best is done by judi dench, who clearly understands the imperiousness of the aristocracy. brenda blethyn takes some liberties in making mrs. bennet less awful than austen's portrayal. her portrayal is interesting and seems to work. donald sutherland is miscast. his affected british accent is terrible and he portrays mr. bennet too much as a father of the 20th century and not a father of the late 18th century. matthew macfadeyn's portrayal of darcy is flat. i can't imagine anyone falling in love with his mr. darcy. keira knightly is a pretty elizabeth, but her portrayal of elizabeth bennet is far too modern. knightly focuses on the elizabeth's forthrightness, but her portrayal completely lacks an understanding of the social mores and conventions of the time. she would have done well to actually read the novel before attempting to portray elizabeth and to do research on the behavior of women of the period.if one is making a period movie, one must be true to the period. this film needed an historical adviser who actually knows something about the regency period. it also needed a writer who has a better appreciation and understanding of austen's text. i can only hope emma thompson decides to do a film of pride and prejudice in the near future to erase this abomination from our minds.the best thing that can be said about this film is that it contains many pretty scenes of the english countryside. chatsworth is well used as pemberly (as it was in the 1995 bbc adaptation). but pretty scenery and pretty actors cannot save this film. true fans of austen will rush home to watch their dvds of the far superior 1995 bbc production with jennifer ehle and colin firth or to read austen's text in order to wipe this version from their minds.

this movie is simply bad. first of all the story is just weird and it's not good written. it leaves you with questions when you're finished. sometimes that's ok, but not in this case.the acting is nothing to write home about. the adults does a ok job, but the kids, taken in consideration they are kids, does not a good job. i thought the lead role, ian costello as mickey, was worst. well, to be honest i'm not sure that was the lead role. never quite figured who this movie was about. mickey or pete.there were some shots that stood out, but over all there were nothing exiting about the cinematography. the sound, however, was better. there was a nice score. a little adventure kind of score, though this didn't look like an adventure film to me. it had some elements of an adventure film, but it was more of a drama. however, it was hard to tell who this film was meant for. children? hardly. there is too much language and violence for that. adults? i don't know. it had to many elements of a children's movie in it. it was like a adult movie in a children movie wrapping.the story was just weird. i don't have much of an idea of what it really was about. you was thrown right in to it without knowing anything, but there were all the time references to something you felt you should know. the fact that the children's parents were dead for instance and that mickey blamed pete for it. you expected to get to know what happened , but you never got.all together this movie was bad and a waste of time. there was no drive in it. nothing to really move the story forward. this is not what you spend your saturday night on.

this is probably the worst film i have ever seen. mike myers tries to be a dramatic actor and fails miserably. the children, who have the major roles, are almost impossible to understand and are really unpleasant characters. it was not even worth the price of the rental.

as was mentioned by others, could there be any other reason to see this film other than to see former "wayne's world" star mike myers play a serious role? the story line is interesting but lacks development and is sabotaged by loose ends and bad characters. if there was any good scenic shots of ireland then it would give it another reason to see it. but instead it focuses on a little normal village that is obviously surrounded by the 'green pastures' of the emerald-isle that are often shown in irish films. if there was any cultural 'spice' to admire the "irish personality" it would be worth seeing, however this could have almost been shot in england. too bad for myers, but this one fails to please or satisfy the heart of anybody who ever wanted to visit the land of guiness.

pete's meteor. i seen this referred to as "authentic" and a "gem." i caught this movie on a saturday afternoon. i kinda wished that i didn't.apparently this was noted as being mike myers' first dramatic role. unfortunately it had to be this movie. the first thing you'll notice that pete's meteor suffers from is a complete lack of plot. or rather, a bunch of little subplots that aren't really connected and don't go anywhere. young orphan mickey lives with his younger brother and sister with their grandmother. a meteorite lands in their garden and is eventually collected by a scientist named hugh. despite the title of the movie, mickey is the one who lays claim to the meteor, and the "storyline" actually has little to do with the meteor in any shape or form. from here on out, several other characters and subplots are introduced. but like i said before, they don't really go anywhere.things go from cute family movie to dark thriller pretty fast, when pete (mike myers) is introduced and starts to play a role. micky blames him for the death of his parents, though we're never really told what happened or why. hugh has romance problems because his girlfriend can't get past his cosmic fascination. and pete's drug-related past starts to catch up with him and temporarily draws his own girlfriend and the rest of the cast into the mix when shady characters start trying to kill him. this would seem to be the main plot, until you realize it doesn't even have a role until halfway through the film, making everything else feel like pointless filler. hugh's girl problems, mickey's bad behavior, the meteor...what on earth do they have to do with this? not much.so the 'plot' is disjointed and half of it is pointless. but a good cast of characters can save it, right? keyword: good. the majority of characters are terribly unlikable people, most of which you'd like to see die horribly. at least, i know i would. despite the title, mickey seems to be the main character, which is a really bad move once you see him in action. he is one of the worst little kids i've seen in a movie, with an extremely bad attitude problem. he 'borrows' a car, harasses and talks trash to hugh (an adult) for taking the meteor, actually attempts burn the man's house down when he doesn't get his way, and even tries to stab pete with a knife. you'd think a kid like this is on his way to the jail house. unfortunately, one of the worst things about this movie is that mickey never gets what's coming to him. i'm not sure at what point you're supposed to be sympathizing with his character, because he's always a nasty little brat. he's the ringleader for his brother and sister, so they predictably end up taking and backseat and just following whatever he does. amazingly, they're pushed back so far that i can't even remember their names. they might as well not even be there.their grandmother is pretty much a borderline alcoholic. she tends to be just as nasty to hugh as mickey, and likes to push people out of her house and give them evil glares when she's not chugging down liquor bottles and drinking herself silly. pretty ridiculous when you take into account that she's supposed to be taking care of three children. her issues with alcohol are never really addressed, though she does collapse from time to time in the movie.hugh is one of the few likable characters in the movie, but that's only because he's the punching bag for the majority of characters and takes their mess without giving it back. the kids treat him nastily but he always comes back and tries to teach them and do nice things with them. he's got a taxi driver girlfriend who seems to take every aspect of his life as a scientist as a personal offense, attempting to leave him several times in the movie when he goes off into his cosmic lingo or does something to prove that he isn't exactly on the same wavelength as the rest of the characters (thankfully).then there's mike myers as pete. pete, despite having the only solid purpose and plot in the movie, is extremely underused and doesn't play any kind of role until the second half. it's unfortunate that myers got stuck in such a position for a dramatic role. even when pete is getting screen time, half of it is just myers running through dark alleys and hiding in small corners. and even though he was the only real point to this movie, when his plot line brings the movie to a close, it's a strange, unfulfilling conclusion that has all the characters laughing on a good note with a quick and strange explanation behind the title of the movie, making you wonder if they were just performing in the movie you were just watching.the only thing worth seeing in pete's meteor is mike myers' role as pete, and that's if you can wade through this disjointed mess long enough without lashing out at another human being due to the extremely unlikable characters and nonexistent plot line. no sir, i didn't like this one at all.

the name of this film and the clips that i saw caused me to believe that this film would have excitement and interesting moments. i was disappointed. the desert sands were interesting but this film inched along at a snails pace. it started fine with an underground cave and something coming out but then tried to involve us with the lives of some very unlikeable human beings. as they found dead bodies, or should i say, skeletons with some flesh on them, they began a search for the reason why? at times it became somewhat different as something was following them in the desert. some type of black ooze or something that would begin to eat the flesh of humans. as the flesh was munched upon, a bag of bones began to creep after the remaining humans. the reason for this black ooze as we find out was pretty bad, ants? unbelieveable! then the ending made no sense. i guess the motto of this film will be, when you have an itch and see an ant, quickly kill it before the ant's friends smell your flesh.

no really, im not kidding around here folks, and i so cant believe how many people here have given it really really positive reviews! oh wait, its the imdb comments section, silly me. its interesting to note that at this date, there have not been enough votes to give this film a rating out of ten, yet there are dozens of comments that rave about the film. what does this mean i wonder? anyway, the script is terrible. character change their personality and motivation and actions every scene, in order to keep the movie running along at something that vaguely resembled a pace. it wasnt even dumb behaviour, that was there too, but the pure idiocy of the script transcended any dumbness the characters displayed. for instance: karl is disobeying an order because there are two dead bodies in the desert and "the killer is out here somewhere" so he forces everyone to travel 40kms in order to find the killer, disobeying orders and p*ssing everyone off. when the hero spots something nasty in the darkness and warns karl, karl tells our hero to stop being an idiot and that there's nothing out there so they are all going home. next scene, he is refusing to let it go and must hunt down whatever it is. it is just a joke. yes, the monster is very impressive, but the crap that the humans say about it just tries to cancel out its interesting aspects, and the predator and alien rip off moments were very tedious. and the ending...the ending!?!?! jesus....the worst film i saw the year, and i saw bug buster!

this horror tale takes place in the namib desert of africa. a canadian systems analyst, zach straker(scott bairstow)is sent on an assignment for a diamond mining company. although he hates field work, he finds himself in a truck with a rescue unit in the open desert fighting sand flies and whipping, blowing sand. four diamond prospectors are found...well whats left of their scattered bones are discovered. during a long cold desert night a shape-shifting monster makes its appearance. zach and his colleagues are terrified when their truck is stranded and members of the unit are dying horribly one by one. there is no character development; let alone dialogue to speak of. the desert set in its own way is beautiful and without giving anything away... the creature is as old as the desert sands. also in the cast are: rachel shelley, warrick grier and patrick shai.

***spoilers*** ***spoilers*** some bunch of afrikkaner-hillbilly types are out in the desert looking for diamonds when they find a hard mound in the middle of a sandy desert area. spoilers: the dumbest one starts hitting the mound with a pick, and cracks it open. then he looks into the hole and sticks his head in and surprise! something eats him. the other two dimwits are not seen alive again. scott bairstow looks like a pizza delivery boy but he plays some kind of expert scientist with a medical degree (which means he should be about 35 years old, minimum). bairstow is supposed to join camp c and help them find diamonds. the truck that picks up bairstow to take him to camp c has a handful of the kind of weirdoes that usually populate movies like "pitch black" "the thing" etc. the truck happens to drive across the first truck and they decide to investigate (how come that truck did not see the other truck when they were driving to pick up bairstow, since they were travelling the same road??). so they find the eaten bodies, and there are some decent special effects relating to bones with little bits of flesh on them. the main lunatic in the group, karl, decides that they must find the killer. so the truck drives around in the desert following some tracks, and eventually it has an electrical short and the crew is stuck in the desert. the dumbest guy in this group had picked up a bunch of bones using his jacket to carry them around. when he takes a nap (wearing the same jacket) the creatures eat him alive, and another guy runs over and sticks his arm into the goo and that dummy loses his arm too. sounds exciting so far, except that a few minutes later, dr. bairstow realizes that the creature is really hundreds of thousands of ants who are using the bones to hold each other together so they can travel to a new hive (because the miners cracked open the old hive). now, last time i checked, ants could move around on their own, without having to kill people in order to use the bones for structure. if all they need was something hard, they could have put a bunch of sticks together and used those to create a form. the whole story is really, really dumb, and the ant explanation is the only one given. the rest of the movie is just about the group getting killed off until they find the new ant-nest, and kill the ant-brain (sort-of), and the hundreds of thousands of ants then walk away on their own itty-bitty feet. there is a spare ant-brain found (off-camera) and sent back for analysis thus creating a reason for a sequel.

when i saw the poster at the theater, i thought that it is a "new line" of a horror story without a famous cast worth giving a try. but, after i went in, i wanted to leave after 20 minutes. there was a lot of non-sense and logical flaws. to me, it is a movie that is not worth putting in theaters. it is not even worth seeing.

i wasted 5 dollars renting this complete piece of crap. dr. zack is the most unlovable lead character i have ever seen. the movie was full of every cliche you could ever think of and contained not a single ounce of originality. there was the typical sexism portrayed by rugged foreigners, all the guys had those 'too-proud to take advice' attitudes that are as stale as grandma's christmas fruitcake. the concept and deaths were really cool, but they lose all novelty once the monster is revealed. (read the spoiler at the end) nothing else is really revealed though, the ending is the biggest cop-out you've ever seen. i predicted everything before it happened, including who would die and how. the dialogue is lacking, and that's an understatement by far. there's mostly just random yelling, thoughtful staring, and chunky sentences. the actors are just god awful! i don't want to talk about this movie anymore, it's making me angry. i just wonder if the director even watched it when it was done.(spoiler alert!!!! save 5 dollars!) the monster is just a bunch of ants that "evolved" so now they need bones so they can move around, (nevermind the fact that this serves no evolutionary advantage whatsoever, and that the ants just killed whoever was available, though the movie acts like they kill out of necessity. this movie made me dumber.) the end consists of the lead idiot killing the mother ant (a big blob thing) which destroys all the other ants. pretty cliche eh? he almost wusses out at the end because of a sudden emotional attachment to the mother-thing that overcomes him. give me a break.

i gave this movie 2 instead of 1 just just because i am a polite person. this movie made me loose 90 minutes of my life in which i could have done something useful for the human kind or just me. the dialog is poor, the actors never look scared! even if it's supposed to be a horror movie. for example the scene in which kurt collects the bones of his former colleague. he should be frightened, but he looks quite normal. the chick of the movie is such a cliché. the one thing i liked about her is the dress she wore in the final scene.and, by the way, the end was extremely predictable with the cocoon blinking pinkly in the box. as a matter of fact, i was thinking more of an ant walking around on the back seat of the car. but it still didn't surprise me.

this is another alien imitation and not a very good one at that.replace outer space with the south african desert,throw in the same ingredients,a group of people stranded in an inhospitable landscape, have them hunted down by an alien creature and you have the same old story of a very ordinary film trying to ape a classic film. a group of miners and scientists go on a hunt for some missing colleagues and find their bones in the desert stripped clean of flesh.their vehicle breaks down and they head for civilisation while being stalked by the monster. the african location is pretty enough but that is basically all this film has going for it. there is a vain attempt to build up the tension but i found this didn't really work and made the film rather boring.the creature didn't appear much and when it did it didn't really install a feeling of horror.there is one scene where someone gets the flesh ripped from his arm but that was basically it on the gore front. in conclusion i found this film about as exciting as watching paint dry.i give this film 4/10 and that is only because of the interesting location which alone isn't enough to save this movie from being a total snooze-fest

the bone snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the namib desert. when the find them, they are nothing more than bones stripped clean and they could not have been dead for more than six hours. the story keeps you interested as to what exactly caused this. the characters are well enough, and the acting is pretty good.about an hour and ten minutes in when you find out what is causing the bones to be stripped clean, you sigh "oh, that is really stupid." the movie is ruined by bad writing and a non-exciting ending. up until that point, the movie was pretty good, and it is a shame that it took such a bad turn. so i cannot recommend this movie. i gave it a 4/10.

the lavish production values that you generally find in a merchant/ivory film are all here, but this is an exceedingly dull take on what could have been a very lively affair. i agree with an earlier poster that it makes no sense for the story to be unfolding through the eyes of an african american family and yet their own ancestor, sally hemmings, has barely a role to play in the proceedings. there is not much clarity to be found in helping the audience understand the motivations of any of these historical figures. and i was very bothered by the accents of a number of the characters. nancy marchand sounded very british for what one assumes is a french nun. and both gwyneth paltrow and greta scacchi seemed to be trying out different accents in various scenes. in fact, gwyneth is very poorly served in this biopic. her role as thomas jefferson's daughter, martha, is written in such a manner that we never get a handle on who she really is. one moment she is slapping a slave, and another moment, she's deploring the whole system of slavery. nick nolte performs the role well enough but doesn't ever make us truly care for jefferson or any of his exploits. very disappointing all in all.

a day in the life of a dimwitted cab driver sometime around christmas: the cab driver picks up a fare...they have a 'really insightful' interlude...he drops off the fare...he picks up another fare...another interlude...and so it goes on like this for 90 friggin' minutes...none of it convincing (or interesting) for even one minute...skip it!

if you have ever wanted to know more about cab drivers, then this is an excellent movie to watch, for informational purposes only. i can just hear it now, "wait, just wait a second! why don't we follow a cab driver through his entire day! cabbies are funny, and so are the people they meet, and they only talk to each other for just a couple of minutes, so the other actors should be cheap! harry, you take care of production, joan, you've got materials, brian, you go round up some actors and we'll all meet back here tomorrow to start filming!"the first 90% of the movie could not have been any worse had that very thing happened. at least with no planning whatsoever, there is always the element of surprise to be found. some of jim carrey's movies have stuff added as they go along and they always do well at the box offices. the problem here is that the first 90% is pretty well scripted out, and it pretty much sucks. paul dillon plays the cab driver in chicago who is working all day. we pretty much see what he sees. people get in and out of his car and he drives all around town. he talks to those people for a few seconds and then we get some more people. i'll admit, there were a couple of funny bits here and there. a religious family tries to talk the cab driver into going to church with them, he takes a pregnant lady and her husband to the hospital, breaks up a rich businessman from his girlfriend, a poor girlfriend from her boyfriend and takes a rape victim home. i guess the moral of the movie is that a cab driver is more than a cab driver and has a larger sphere of influence over the lives of his passengers than you might originally think. for some people, he's just a means of getting from here to there, but for others, his very ordinary words help change the direction of their lives.the last passenger of the day is used to try make sense of the rest of the movie, and to a small extent it succeeds. it had a bit of that deathbed repentance feel to it where the good majority of the movie sucks and then at the very end, it tries to make it all better in just one or two changes. i wasn't too impressed with the movie as a whole, but there were a few bits and pieces worth watching again. as far as the actors go, paul dillon is it. john cusack, gillian anderson and julianne moore are all in this, for about 30 seconds each, but don't watch this for any of them or you will most certainly be disappointed. i will give the other people invovled some credit that it's not your ordinary movie they have produced here, but it wasn't a very good one either. there just wasn't enough material to keep you going for an hour and a half. it was a decent effort, but it failed none the same.

i don't know if i hate this movie as much as i did when i watched it two weeks ago, but if you're expecting the events described on the box, forget it... that would have been a good movie. the great descent described on the box is nothing compared to the descent into utter dispair that i took viewing this movie. if you've seen hbo's taxi cab confessions, this is the same thing, only fictional, and not even remotely as interesting. if you really want to see something interesting about a cab driver, check out the 20 minute short they run on encore from time to time... it is actually worth watching. i have never, ever asked for my money back for a movie until i saw this ... thing. boring, boring, boring. it does offer one unique trait, which is this: it leaves you to decide what happens to each of the passengers, letting your imagination fill in the gaps. which would be great, if you actually cared about any of these people. instead i found myself yelling at the screen, weeping like a child, praying for either the end of the movie or my own death. the cab driver himself (though well played, considering) runs through emotions seemingly at random, from sarcastic to sympathetic to raging lunatic to apathetic. sometimes it is appropriate, most of the time it's just a display for it's own sake. "dammit, i learned all these emotions in acting class, and i'm gonna use them!" now that i've been thinking about it again, i do hate this movie as much as i did!

the girl in lovers' lane: 3 out of 10: homoerotic subtext in the movies is a well known phenomenon. plenty of dissertations have come out of film schools about the hidden subtexts in such films as top gun and spartacus. the girl in lover’s lane certainly fits the homoerotic trope. in fact, it is so blatant and over the top even mst3k, whom rarely notes such things in their riffing, simply cannot avoid it.the film is about two drifters. one a rich kid (lowell brown) running away from home with a hundred dollars and no street smarts, the other is a professional hobo (brett halsey). the hobo saves the kid from a gang of thugs and they end up in a small town consisting of a diner, a pool hall and a whorehouse. our drifter scholar gets a second look from the diner’s waitress (joyce meadows as the titular girl in lovers lane) who clearly is past the age of being choosy and whose only other prospect is creepy jack elam doing a steve buscemi impression.on the surface, this seems like a strange film for the mst3k treatment. while the cast are to old for the characters they are playing, the acting is actually pretty good with both brett halsey and jack elam giving solid performances. the story is slight, but hardly the robot vs. aztec mummy material and the production values are cheap back lot, but relatively competent.it is the strange batman and his ward homosexual undercurrents that make this film both awful and hilarious. halsey’s over the top objections to the kids attempts to get laid in the whorehouse are hilarious, his inability to commit to the waitress (or at the least get past first base) are telling, and the dozens of glances between him and the kid; a hand on shoulder, the sleeping arrangements, blowing off dates with the girl so he and the kid can shave each other. you don’t have to be freud to figure out this undercurrent.

i have noticed that a lot of films that have been featured on "mystery science theater" have received a tons of low ratings on imdb. however, a few of the films featured on the films weren't that bad and it's not fair to rate a film that's been given the "mst" treatment--with the hosts making funny comments during the film. now i am not saying that "the girl in lover's lane" is a great film, but it's not nearly bad enough to merit its current imdb score of 2.1.the film begins with bix and danny meeting. bix is a veteran drifter and danny a younger guy who seems to have no particular reason to be wandering about the country. once they blow into a small town, bix needs to rescue danny again and again because danny is quite naive--a nice way of saying he has the intellect of a tomato.along the way, something happens to the self-assured bix--he finds a nice young lady and finds the lure of staying put pulling at him. and, in an odd subplot, jack elam plays a super-creepy sicko who wanders the town scaring the crap out of everyone--yet oddly, the police don't seem to take much notice nor does anyone on their own do anything about him. ultimately, however, when elam puts the moves on a girl who bix is falling for, things come to a full boil.overall, while not at all a great film, there were many interesting plot elements in this film--enough to merit a score higher than 2.1. the biggest negatives are a simplistic conclusion to the mystery that occurs near the end as well as the total stupidity of danny one time too often. considering the minuscule budget, however, it's a watchable little film.

okay... for the most part, and all its cheesiness, this movie was actually pretty good for an mst3k flick... but then they decided to ruin what little goodness it had about fifteen minutes before the ending. *spoiler alert* the film is very basic... a rich mama's boy named danny meets a bum named bix, and the two of them travel to a small town, where bix meets a pretty girl named carrie (who is so very.) now, this film's basic premise seemed promising enough. all they needed to do was follow the simple chemistry of any romance movie... carrie loves bix... bix loves carrie... a creepy guy in town lusts for carrie... now, i know what you're thinking... bix fights the creep and ultimately decides to settle down with carrie, and danny returns home, and they all live happily ever after... right? wrong!! because carrie gets murdered by the town creep, because bix is too gay to commit. (there are so many homosexual undertones between danny and bix.) and then, the whole town decides to lynch bix, even though the town creep would've easily been the prime suspect. then, the town creep confesses to killing carrie without much hesitation... (must've felt bad, the poor dope.) then, danny brings bix home with him... that's the film's "happily ever after." sad, huh? all i can say is, thank god for joel and the bots. because they turned this horse hockey into one of my favorite mst3k episodes.

the girl in lovers lane is one strange little low-budget film. on its surface, the movie tells the story of a tough drifter named bix (brett halsey) who spends his time looking out for a young kid named danny (lowell brown) and the girl, carrie (joyce meadows), that bix meets who would like to look out for him. nothing overly interesting happens (bix goes out with carrie, bix gets danny out of trouble, carrie's father drinks a lot, etc.) until about 10 minutes to go in the movie when carrie is murdered. her father blames bix, pulls him out of a jail cell, and just about beats him to death. now their roles are reversed and danny has to save bix.until i read the reviews on imdb, i thought that maybe it was just me reading more into bix and danny's relationship than was really there, but i see now that i'm not alone. it was quite obvious to me early on that bix and danny had more of a relationship than you usually see in a movie from 1959. the homosexual nature of their relationship, while never openly expressed, is still quite obvious. their living and sleeping arrangements, bix's reaction to finding danny in bed with a prostitute, bix's inability to commit to carrie, and that phone call at the end when danny tells his parents he's "brining home a friend are a few examples of moments that lead to the inevitable conclusion that there's more to their relationship than initially meets the eye. i'm sure they exist, but i can't think of any movies i've seen from the 50s that scream homosexual quite as loudly as this one.as for the movie, i don't know any other way to put this  it's boring. as i wrote earlier, nothing much at all happens for 90% of the run time. the characters are dull and the actors aren't good enough to give the girl in lovers lane much of a spark. the lone exception is jack elam. his crazy jesse is the one character interesting enough to be worth watching. elam had creepy down pat! but i guess the biggest problem i had with the movie was with character motivation and logic. carrie is killed and bix is immediately blamed? what about crazy jesse who has been stalking carrie for probably her whole life? anyone think to ask jesse where he was that night? her father has seen him bother carrie at the diner, yet he never considers that the leering jesse might have something to do with his daughter's death? not a lot of logic there. and what about jesse's confession? danny grabs jesse by the lapel and this is all it takes to force a confession out of jesse? real tough guy, huh? why would he confess so easily? and after he confesses, no one thinks to grab him? it's awfully nice of jesse just to stay put and not run off. in any other reality, he would have never spilled his guts and would have run like a rabbit if he had been fingered for the murder. the fact that the girl in lovers lane asks me to accept these ridiculous actions on the part of the characters is something i'm not willing to do. overall, i'm giving the girl in lovers lane a 4/10.

a young man, named danny, has run away from home and meets a drifter, named bix, who agrees to tag along with danny and watch out for him... and his money. they end up in a small town where they meet carrie - a shy, naive girl working in her father's diner. bix starts seeing carrie but he plans on leaving soon (because he's a drifter, see? he's no good! understand?). meanwhile, the town creep, jesse (played by a perfectly casted jack elam), keeps showing up at the diner and bothering carrie. danny keeps inadvertently picking up whores left and right (because he's loaded with money  he has almost a hundred dollars!) whom bix has to constantly chase away (there are a lot of ambiguously gay overtones between danny and bix in this flick). eventually, bix and danny decide to leave town but trouble is a-brewing, due to jesse the creep.my review of the movie itself: a terrible, dated "troubled youth" flick from the '50s.my review of the mst3k version of the movie: i've got to say that this is one of the best episodes of mst3k ever. the riffing is dead-on, all the time. except for the somewhat downbeat ending, this movie is easy material for joel and the bots, especially danny's constant screw-ups that bix has to rescue him from. the host segments are pretty good too, especially the segment with the `train song.' hopefully, rhino releases this episode to home video one day.

this one is one of those classic b movie following the exploits of 2 hobos. it's done really cheesily and big stupid running off one-liners like a cardboard cassanova. but jack elam steals every scene he's in as the creepazoid jesse (now jerome!). my favorite scene is the lynch mob and the dad's voice going up 10 octaves ("you loved her?"). danny, big stupid's protege, is surprisingly stupider, but not as loathsome as our lead star. there's also a quaint scene of a guy pimping at the diner. joyce meadows is the sweet, naive nice gal and probably the least annoying. and those yellow ruffles (rawr!). oh, and booze is evil according to mr. stupid.this movie's a hoot. watch the mst cover of this and crow's terrific elam homage!

i should have realized that any two-video set being sold for only $6 would be bad. i even read the reviews before watching this film, and that still didn't sway me. i loved the book, and i knew it couldn't be as bad as people said.yeah, it is.a patchwork of film, video, and what appears to be stock footage combine to make a three-hour tour of one chapter of james a. michener's epic novel. well, the time period covered was one chapter, but i don't remember many of the situations actually occurring in the book. the packaging on my copy of the movie gives maria conchita alonso top billing - though it turns out that she is only in one speaking scene. on the second tape.the actors are to be commended for playing their roles well, despite a smarmy, overwrought script. they are to be insulted, though, for accepting the roles in the first place.

i rented this movie to get an easy, entertained view of the history of texas. i got a headache instead. the depiction of history in this movie is so comical that even mad tv would not have done a better job.

the texas revolution of 1835 to 1836, including the periods preceding and immediately following, is depicted in this mediocre 3-hour made-for-television film, whose only redeeming value is bringing light and paying homage to stephen f. austin, the so-called "father of texas" whose life story had long been overshadowed by that of the legendary sam houston. the rest of the film is simply the usual "santa anna is a tyrant" storyline and with a weak attempt to show the mexican perspective with a fictional hispanic character displaying stereotypical latin machismo. combined with short low-budget battle scenes, such as the alamao and san jacinto, this film is recommended only for real history buffs who who do not come from mexico. to its credit, the mexican uniforms look accurate and the romantic subplot (another love triangle) doesn't take up too much screen time. overall, this movie depicts the violent secession movement by texas' anglo-saxon racial minority to be a positive and just revolution against mexican tyranny as personified by the general antonio lopez de santa anna, the so-called "napoleon of the west".

although it's been hailed as a comedy-drama i found "crooklyn" to be mostly depressing. it's hard to imagine how spike lee could look back affectionately on so much chaos, petty cruelty, irresponsibility and mean-spiritedness.

crystal voyager is a strange documentary about an eccentric surfer living in australia. an american by birth george greenough has surfed and photographed himself, friends and recently, dolphins, in australia for 35 years, all using various re invented cameras which he either straps on his back, board or boat. in the mid 70s he teamed up with surf mag editor and budding film maker david elfick to create this visually interesting tale about this life and photography. the 75 minute feature crystal voyager is the result. even in the 70s audiences were a bit puzzled by this film, neither surf-ing movie nor surf movie, because george swims about on a children's zippy board, not a real surfboard.... it offset the tedious droning of george (occasionally so dry or droll that it was actually funny.. like almost setting himself on fire or falling over something) with a spectacular 'you are there' power glide through a wave that ran for 23 minutes all set to pink floyd music. in 1974 when the sydney opera house opened, it also contained a cinema. crystal voyager was booked in there as an arty-sporty oz pic and by default became a hit: as the 'opera house tickets' cost far more than a movie ticket, audiences flocked to see this film as an excuse to 'have been to the sydney opera house'...so the film did record business as a low budget attraction to locals and tourists who wanted to tell neighbors that they had seen a show 'there'. this created this myth that the film was a huge crowd puller and the reputation spread. as a result it was teamed with the fantasy cartoon fantastic planet and had a trippy run through the uk and europe as a double feature. i ran it at a coastal cinema in the 70s and the crowd was rather nonplussed about it all. recently george has re emerged lord of the flies style with another well photographed sea adventure called dolphin glide that offers viewers a dive and swim with the wild dolphins of byron bay. it is an eccentric 20 min short with an even more eccentric 20 min 'how george did it' short. each were met with a collective yawn by both the media and the pubic in january 2005.... all of which makes crystal voyager a 'you had to have been there' fluke all those years ago. however at a special oz surf night at an outdoor cinema last year 2000 people turned up....but then 2000 turn up every night to see anything there during this summer season of films.....so the damned thing fluked another box office binge. how many actually enjoyed it is very much open to debate. again they were more than likely just plain puzzled by this mad film with an astonishing reputation. elfick however, since 1975, has gone onto a stellar career as a major producer and director of many lauded australian and international films. look up no worries or starstruck or undercover or rabbit proof fence or love in limbo for clear and present applause at his achievements. george, however, is still floating around out there somewhere droning away and looking for something else to film, or drop a camera on.

well to start off i was like, wow this is new, so when is the film starting, and out of this in between stuff. but it never ended. the film is just one big in between! and after 10 minutes of waiting for something to actually happen, apart from water splashing around, i just started getting angry! there is nothing in this documentry and nothing will be learned. completely boring and rubbish!

i wish i had read the comments on imdb before i saw this movie. the first 1 hour was ok, though it did make me wonder why everything was centered at chicago and why no one reported any weather anomaly from outside us. isolated acts of nature (of this magnitude) are unthinkable. but beyond the first 60 minutes, the movie just drags on like a never-ending story. the screenplay is horrible. as for the actors, very poor choice. only the people hired to run in panic stick to their roles. but i do have to agree that this movie has got some good 'special effects'. if you rented it on a dvd and would want to watch the movie, despite the reviews, then play it on maximum speed your player would allow!

there have been some great television movies in that past. epics such as "roots" and "lonesome dove" come to mind. category 6: day of destruction will not be remembered for advancing the cause of made-for-tv movies. a laughably bad story, surpassed only by the horrible screenplay, cat6dd, as i like to call it, inspires more sympathy for the actors involved than terror in nature that the movie was supposed to bring out. that sound you hear during the movie is supposed to be the sound of wind, but instead it's actually the careers of randy quaid, brian dennehy, and thomas gibson (greg, of the dharma & greg duo) plummeting faster than houses and trucks and cows can fly away from one of the 15 tornadoes we see in the first 5 minutes of the movie. the movie was advertised as "nature gone amok," instead we get a lame story about how 15 different weather systems conspire to produce 150 degree days in chicago, then a blizzard the next day from a hurricane that was in the gulf of mexico that combined with a storm system from canada but actually had it's origins in a jet stream changed by global warming.... enough!! it didn't matter what the story was, the acting was terrible, the words the actors said were dumb, and 13 scientists throughout the country had coronaries after hearing the dribble that came out of the movie. i didn't care what happened to any of the characters, the special effects were sub-par, even for made-for-tv standards, and the story lines were pointless. all in all, i really really dislikes this "tv event."

this made for tv film is about every cliché you can come up with for a disaster movie. the only problem is it isn't very well done.my brain is still insulted from the scenes in which brian dennehy is supposedly looking at a computer monitor looking for weather pattern data and showing on that monitor are stock footage scenes of weather turmoil ala the weather channels commercials. why would watching local news footage of a washed out side-street give insight to global weather patterns? you got me.also interspersed through out the first two hours are some of the worst cgi effects known to man. watch for the semi truck and the airplane that look like they were rendered on a commodore 64.all the foreshadowing in this "movie" is done with the subtlety of a sledgehammer, the dialog is forced and i can't think of a likable character that i want to survive the second half.the character i hate the most is the stupid wife who's husband is cheating. maybe if she lifted a finger at anytime during the show instead of being a helpless woman who stands in the the same 10 square feet of the kitchen all day her husband wouldn't be sleeping with the pr rep for a rival energy company. she is so helpless, in fact, i want to put her out of her and my misery. i hope everyone in this "movie" dies in the second half.

what a mess--and i'm not referring to the "destruction" in the title. i could go on about the hackneyed plot, the lousy effects, the (actually notable) cast grimacing as they deliver the worst lines of their careers, etc. i'll just say there weren't any palm trees in chicago the last time i checked, and leave it at that.hmmm...need ten lines to get this posted on imdb.. ok, well, i think a dvd release with outtakes could be interesting. maybe dennehy will reveal what favor got called in for him to appear in this thing. maybe dianne weist will show us the bag of money it must have taken to get her involved. maybe cbs execs will apologize...

i can't believe i actually spent almost three hours of my life watching this. this must be one of the most unbelievable, predictable and cheesy television movies i have seen in a long time. i was hoping for some good special effects and action, instead i spent the entire time rolling my eyes and yelling "oh come on!!!", at the screen. the dialog is shallow and obvious, the acting strained at times and as the story moves along, isn't it just funny how everything happens at the same time... not to mention the obvious and nauseating ending... now i've seen more than my share of disaster movies, i am a big fan actually, and think that often they can pull off completely unrealistic stuff as long as it's done in a fun way, but this is definitely not it. this is just an insult to intelligent viewers everywhere. what were they thinking when they made this movie?????

i think "category 6: day of destruction" was very unrealistic. the digital effects where like a children's cartoon. the actors didn't act realistically, for example, when the girl was shot she acted like she got tomato sauce splatted on her. the movie was boring but i watched it because it was on. the only interesting character was tornado tommy, he was funny!please keep the special effects real.i liked the comment: "what did we do to p.i.s.s-off mother nature?"i don't know what else to write to fill up the 10 lines. what else can i say the movie is so boring, i think my comment will be equally boring.

what is this!! its so bad. the animation looks so terrible , it looks like a ps1 type game. the actors are awful, they just cannot act to save their lives. i sat through all of this film an then at the end i was annoyed when i realised i had wasted 3 hours of my life. i've not heard of this film, did it ever actually come out in the cinema or did it go straight to dvd? a girl got shot?! what is up with that, it was just a stupid film. they totally copied 'the day after tomorrow'. its got to be one of the worst films i have ever seen. i would definitely recommend to people to not waste their time with this. you could spend your time watching 'the day after tomorrow', its a lot better. well thats what i think of the film. actually why have i wasted my time writing about it, ah dam!! its really annoying me, its wasted 3 hours and 10 minutes now.

the first two hours of the televised version are full of character and plot exposition -- after an early brief sequence of las vegas being hit by tornadoes, the action doesn't really start until the second two hours. still, some character relationships don't become clear until the second part. the actors turn in competent performances, but nothing special (however, better than those in "aftershock: earthquake in new york"). an exception is randy quaid, whose character is superfluous and incredibly annoying. the plot is a pretty standard mix of parts of "independence day", "speed", "the day after tomorrow", "earthquake", "the towering inferno" and several other films. you can predict what will happen next, and come close to predicting the dialog, word for word. the special effects are unbelievably bad. despite the effects in "twister", the tornadoes in this film seem less realistic than the one in "the wizard of oz" and other effects were obviously done for less money than such series as "csi" and "cold case" spend on the totality of a single episode. if you have to see a made-for-tv disaster film, see "the day after", "asteroid", or "special bulletin" instead -- you'll get better plots, acting, and effects.

this one was truly awful. watching with fascinated horror, i kept on asking "why have they done this?" that is, taken all the scenarios out of "the day after tomorrow", "the perfect storm" and "twister" and remixing them in a three-hour miniseries, directed by long-time junk tv director dick lowry, with every disaster movie cliché known to man and not an ounce of real suspense. many of the cast were unknown canadians and location filming was done in canada, winnepeg doubling for chicago, so no doubt tax breaks had something to do with it. although some ambitious special effects were attempted, the execution is so poor no decent spectacle is achieved. the actors may be a competent lot; the script is so bad no-one had a chance to show it, except perhaps for randy quaid as tommy the tornado chaser, who went right over the top and was quite amusing.believe it or not, the producers have since made another one of these canadian disaster turkeys called "category 7  the end of the world" which was very tastefully shown on cbs in the us a few weeks after hurricane katrina. how could the network of ed murrow and walter cronkite do such a thing? in prime time? pt barnum "nobody ever went broke underestimating public taste" is proved right once more.

the only reason i know this film exists is because i wanted to see what nancy mckeon had been up to since the facts of life ended. when i searched her name, up came this relatively new tv movie. after much investigation i managed to locate a copy & was thoroughly disappointed with what i viewed. d grade acting, poor script, terrible fx - it was like watching a toned down, more stupefied version of day after tomorrow that went for 3 hours. despite the long running time the characters remain fairly under-developed, we do not care about them in the slightest & in most cases are longing for their demise. combine that with terrible lighting & cinematography & you have a real disaster of a film. how they con-viced so many "name" actors (i.e dianne weist, randy quaid, brian dennehy) to appear in such trash is mind-blowing. in summary - i want those 3 hours of my life back!!!

what i hate most in this garbage is the arrogant attitude of the film makers and network execs who foist this nonsense on the public because they really think the audience is so stupid, so undeserving, so tasteless as to deserve these kind of cons. there is an inherent entertainment is seeing disaster movies and with the magic of today's cgi effects artists are given powerful tools to explore what before was denied them. with that allure we sat down to watch some mayhem and destruction. well, guess what, the only mayhem we saw was in the ads touting next wednesday's episode. what a let down! but wait, there was even a bigger one. the script itself was the bigger disaster! and then there was the direction and the flaccid acting by everyone involved in this turkey. but we knew this before right?! we knew that effects alone do not an entertainment make, but yet the network bozos who okayed this tv movie didn't care about that because in their mantra is the everlasting line "never underestimate how stupid the audience are". these guys must actually live by this motto, and i am so fed up of it. no wonder the audience has abandoned us drama in droves and pitched their camp in reality shows. at least in those programs no one is trying to make it look like anything different from what it is: intellectual pornography. well, category 6 is worse than that because it assumes to be different and "original". yes this was a disaster movie alright but the disasters are not what they advertised!
