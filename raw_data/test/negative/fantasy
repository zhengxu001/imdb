i had seen this movie when i was a boy (before wwii) and was surprised that the local library had a copy. saw it again after some sixty years and forgot how bad it was. this is an example of a movie that was not a "a" movie. no editing, poor script, weak acting and not much directing. should not even be as high as a "b" had a laugh at how jaded i've become over the years. seems to me i thought it was good when i originally saw it.

most of wayne's b westerns are kind of fun in a naive way, but this one really stinks. the editing is terrible, and the direction and pacing is completely lethargic. most of the cast stands around waiting for the mute guy to write down his thoughts on a pad of paper, and i was bored. sorry, duke, but this gets a 1.

there were many 'spooky' westerns made in the 30s and early 40s, and although this has a strong beginning, it isn't one. randy bowers (john wayne) stopping at a 'halfway house' saloon, finds it to be full of dead bodies, the bartender's corpse draped over the bar holding a gun, eyes watching randy from behind holes cut through eyes in a picture, and a player piano playing "the loveliest night of the year." it was the result of a robbery by the marvin black gang, to get ed rogers' $30,000. randy is an investigator who "works alone," who wastes little time in getting arrested, escaping (with ed's daughter sally's help) and literally landing in the midst of the black gang's hideout behind a waterfall. it all moves along fairly quickly. only one too many chases after randy slow it down.we even get george hayes, clean shaven and playing two parts-- marvin black, the vilest villain, as well as the good citizen, matt the mute, who communicates via handwritten messages. having him play two opposite roles was a good idea, but the writing down of messages thing gets old real fast, even for him, as he finally gives up doing it near the end saying to sally, "ah, i'm fed up with this!" you can find george playing a vile, vile, double crossing villain in the serial "the lost city" (1934).i think this is the only 'lone star' film in which the title relates to, or is mentioned in the film! sally offers her hand to randy and says, "he's not alone anymore!" then cut to their arms around each other as they look out facing a lake. sally's running off with randy seems too abrupt and not sufficiently prepared for. too much time spent on horseback escaping the sheriff.not that bad considering everything, but not that great either. i'd really give it a 4 and a half.

john wayne is without a doubt one of the most popular and loved actors of all time. his career stretched over forty years, and within that time he starred in films such as "angel and the badman", "the green berets", "sands of iwo jima", "rio bravo", "north to alaska", and "the undefeated".the film's listed above are hailed as some of his best, unlike this 1934 effort "randy rides alone", which has been pretty much forgotten about as time's gone on, which is unsurprising, as it's nothing memorable apart from its very short running time of just 53 minutes.a young john wayne plays randy bowers, who for reasons never really explained, arrives at a saloon in the middle of nowhere and finds that everyone inside has been killed. while looking around, a posse arrives and finds randy there and they arrest him, accusing him of being a gang member and demand to know where the rest of his gang is. he is put in jail accused of the murders. sally rogers, whose uncle owned the saloon and was murdered, arrives at the jail to see randy in order to clarify that he was one of the gang members ( she was hiding in a secret room when the shooting took place ). sally doesn't believe that randy is a killer, and doesn't recognise him, so while the sheriff is out, she slips him the keys and randy escapes. while running away from the sheriff and his posse, randy conveniently stumbles into the gang's hideout in a cave who were responsible for the murders. randy sets out to clear his name, and also to bring the gang to justice."randy rides alone" can be a fun film to watch, especially if you're a john wayne fan. but at the same time it has far too many flaws that are impossible to ignore. the film is also extremely dated, as you would expect; we have the terrible camera shooting which makes everyone look like they are moving in super-fast motion, and the dialogue is terrible. the acting isn't great either, and wayne's character is very wooden and he, along with the rest of the cast, look like wooden puppets who are being conducted by someone ( in this case it's by director harry fraser ). harry fraser is at the helm, and does a good enough job but the story is paper-thin. one can't help but feel that about ten minutes is missing from the start of the film as randy just arrives out of nowhere at the saloon and is looking to meet someone. an explanation on why randy was there is giving later on, which turns out to be something like he is a p.i who was sent to investigate the claims that someone is trying to take over the town. to be honest i didn't really pick it up, most of the time i was hoping for the movie to end.but that being said, i didn't find this film to be completely terrible. i enjoyed some of it and found it to be quite fun at times. but it really isn't a great film, and isn't really worth watching or tracking down.overall, "randy rides alone" is incredibly dated and is a tiresome western with very few redeeming qualities. can be fun but overall it isn't a great movie and is certainly one of wayne's weaker outings.

randy bowers (john wayne) comes upon the half way house at just the right time to take a break from the trail, and discovers a slew of dead bodies inside, among them a man he was supposed to deliver a message to - ed rogers, proprietor of the establishment. he's observed by the dead man's niece sally (alberta vaughn), from behind a hidden room, where she remained unobserved during the carnage."randy rides alone" was directed by harry fraser. he uses a filming technique here as in other of his films, where he fast forwards the action from one location to another, usually involving a rider on a horse. it's pretty well done and appears quite innovative in these 1930's era lone star westerns.pre-gabby george hayes is on hand, sans whiskers, and this is the first time i've seen him as a villain. in fact it took a few scenes to realize it was him in a dual role, first as hunchbacked businessman "matt the mute", communicating via pencil and paper, only to turn into marvin black, leader of a gang of outlaws. black's gang was responsible for the murders at half way house, in an attempt to coerce sally into selling out to matt/marvin. another staple player is here as well, yakima canutt as a black henchman named spike. interestingly, yakima portrayed a villain named sam black in another fraser/wayne oater, "neath the arizona skies".there's a fair amount of time-killing horseback riding back and forth between black's gang and the sheriff's posse, as john wayne's character maneuvers to expose the bad guys. in the end, he saves the day by securing sally rogers' thirty thousand dollars, at the expense of destroying the half way house, where he exchanges some sticks of dynamite for the loot in a safe. greedy marvin black attempts to open it with his six-shooter, and the explosion is a fitting end for the villain. in his best "aw shucks" attitude, john wayne falls under the spell of the pretty sally rogers, and alas, randy rides alone no more!

watching this film today i got the feeling this thing was missing about 10 to 15 minutes or so from the beginning of the story. john wayne rides up on this trading post/saloon out in the middle of nowhere to meet with the owner about some robberies. all he sees is the signs of a massacre, some dead bodies, signs of a fight and no one alive in sight. that's because the owner's daughter is hidden in a secret room, the kind you find in old english murder mysteries.the reason you find those hidden rooms in those kind of stories is that they were formerly priestholes. catholic families clinging to the old faith in 16th century england built these things to hide those on the run from royal authorities because of their faith. not something you see in westerns, but a good gimmick.unfortunately because of bad editing or writing or both we never know exactly what brought wayne to this place exactly. but this was a b western and not even a good one at that.gabby hayes is in this and he's clean shaven and playing a mute part of the time. an unusual circumstance for the garrulous gabby.if you want to bother and find out what happens and see a whiskerless gabby hayes then see this film.

this review is for the uk dvd three-disc box set. disc one is called caught in the act and contains model behavior, chasing jamie and fast and curious. disc two is called bedroom fantasies and contains blue plate special, falling in lust again and love potion no. 10. the final disc is called anything goes and contains chatroom, she's the boss and legally yours. why the other four episodes in the series are not included is a mystery because there is surely enough room on the discs for a lot more material.each episode opens with the hotel manager chloe (lauren hayes) reading a letter from a satisfied customer. we then get to see the story unfolding as the guests check into the hotel. blue plate special is the exception because this story is from a waitress. the writers should be given credit for coming up with a good variety of story lines. for instance, model behavior is about two models vying for the attention of the photo crew; falling in lust again is about a man and woman who parted and rekindle their love when they meet up again at the hotel; she's the boss is about a put-upon male secretary/dogsbody who shows that he is more of a man than his female boss realised - much to her pleasure. all the episodes lead up to lots of nudity and sex.it should come as no surprise that all the characters in this hotel are beautiful women and handsome hunks. even the geeky secretaries get transformed when they remove their spectacles and let their hair down. the sex action is plentiful but to me seems too frantic and false. the camera work could also have done with a bit of moderation, spending too much time close up and so moving about to capture everything, and as usual we get loud music during the sex action. finally, the end credits mention the palm canopy hotel, singer island, florida although my map of florida shows no singer island. the scenery certainly looks more like florida than utah or las vegas that some people have mentioned. this is quite a good effort and it is a pity that the second series is still awaiting a uk dvd release. 4 stars.

it´s long time that i and my wife didn´t see such a boring thriller. it´s definitively not a gripping story and it is paced so slowly that we nearly fell asleep. this could be instead a very low budget tv crime series. there are some ridiculous scenes like the one where mafia boss pirano wants to see the jury lady in a red clothes or another mafioso cannot stop to think about her and so on. okay perhaps this should have been a romantic thriller but believe me you really don´t miss anything. we gave 4/10.

two years after this movie was made, "the juror" came out. don't waste your time on this one. see "the juror" instead. "the juror" is essentially the same story as "trial by jury," with better acting, better directing and a far more gripping aura about it. william hurt was not believable as a cop-gone-bad, and armand assante couldn't be more unlike a mob boss if they had dressed him in a clown outfit. you didn't become involved enough with joann whalley's character to be that upset by what was happening to her. also, the way in which she interacted with the jury wasn't compelling or interesting in any way. kathleen quinlan's role as a hooker/killer wasn't fleshed out enough and quite frankly was unnecessary for to the plot.

a antique shop-owner in nyc, played by joanne whalley(valerie alston)gets put on a us district court jury, on a trial of a known mafioso armand asante(rusty pirone), and most of this very slow-paced film revolves around attempts of pirone attempting to get whalley to acquit him of murder, by threatening to kill her son, and herself. much action ensues, involving gruesome mob-rub outs, interspread with willam hurt as the go-between. much of this silly, disjointed mess surrounds hurt and asante's obsession with whalley, courtroom scenes that we've all seen time and again, and an ending that is unbelievable. 3/10 is probably going easy on this waste of time.

this is without doubt the worst movie i have ever seen. and believe me, i have seen a lot of movies. the unbelievable twist the movie makes - going from an extremely bad "alien lifeforms inhabit earth" movie with sickening bad acting, to a film that tries to spread an archchristian "judgement day is at hand, seek jesus or though shall burn for all eternity in the fiery debts of hell" message - left me stunned after being tormented for 85 minutes. even religious christians must be ashamed or furious by watching their beliefs being posted like this. i didn't know what to do with myself when i watched the horrible acting that could have been performed by 7-year-olds. simply disgusting. i am not a christian nor very religious. but if i had been, i would no longer be afraid of hell. rich christiano has shown be something much, much worse.

i watched gomeda on movie theater at my city. my friend took away me and i was really curious what would be it looked like. well, i must say this movie was not a horror,may be we can say that is 'fantsastic experimentation'...ok here i go anyway... but there was a lot of shooting,acting,dramatic,theatrical and storytelling problems.i can understand because of director is very young and gomeda is his first feature film.ok directing of this film was not pretty bad,i see.unfortunately, due to the restraints placed on the film by its extremely low budget, the visuals are often as murky as the storyline.and there is no powerful gothic scenes.as a horror movie it really fails, no scares at all and it is quite muddled and boring. some people say 'gomeda' is an art movie, but i could not see a laughable,terrible and breoken off art movie like that.so, how can we say it is an art movie!just funny!

this movie changed my life! hogan's performance was nothing short of incredible, and i still haven't recovered from his exclusion from the 1990 oscar nominations. and as brightly as the hulkster shines in this movie, you can't discount the brilliant writing and direction that vaults this masterpiece in to the highest strata of achievement in film. if you haven't seen this movie, drop what your doing right now and get yourself a copy. i guarantee it will blow your mind. and if you don't like it, then i just have one question for you.... watcha gonna do when the 24 inch pythons and hulkamania runs wild on you!!!!

... in search of the cheesiest "so bad it's good" movie, i've repeatedly laughed at the first fifteen minutes of various films, only to be left disappointed and bored at the end. not this time!!! my eyes teared up, my belly and my cheeks ached from laughing so hard throughout the movie. sure, hulk hogan is a subpar actor and the plot is utterly predictable, but everyone dives into this movie knowing all this - all anyone wants to see when renting this is hogan breaking out a can of whoopass, with a bunch of "yeah brother"s and "whatchugonnado"s flying from his infamously goateed mouth. and while the hulkster on the screen pales a bit in comparison to the hulkster in the ring, seekers of the ultimate cheese will certainly not be disappointed by this backhand gem of a flick. a laugh riot.

hulk hogan and zeus are horrible wrestlers and horrible actors. hogan for some reason was popular enough to get a movie deal i'll never know why. if not for vince mcmahon's money this stupid film would have never been made. maybe someday someone will make a good movie about pro wrestling. no holds barred is not that movie.

hulk hogan plays rip a professional wrestler who has a big heart but is pushed to the limit when his girlfriend(joan severence) is kidnapped by thugs who are forcing him to take on another wrestler(tiny lister jr.)bottom of the barrel actioner is such a failure that even hogan looks ashamed to be in it, and with the evidence portrayed, he should be.

take a cliché story and insert steve guttenberg.need i say anymore?this truly is as bad as you would expect. sheriff tom palmer(guttenberg)and anna montgormery attempt to transform a group of useless,inept kids into a winning soccer team.lacking originality and direction from the offset it's quite a struggle to maintain any form of interest in this film. despite my reservations about guttenbergs acting ability i can safely say that the acting of the rival teams coach is actually worse than guttenbergs.previously unimaginable i thought. this type of story of underdogs battling all the way to the top has been done before and better every time than this so called 'film'

nothing more than a soccer knock-off of the mighty ducks, this film proved to be annoying in most aspects. this was one of those times where you're parents ask you to take your younger siblings just so they don't have to deal with them for a few hours. to say the least, my younger sisters liked it, but it proved to be too much like the far superior mighty ducks. oh well, at least olivia d'abo was hot and steve guttenberg still had a job at that point in time.

this is one of the most unoriginal, cliche-ridden movies i have ever seen. even if you didn't like this film's antecedents, 'the bad news bears' and 'the mighty ducks,' they are bound to have done a better job than this one. from the moment the new teacher greets her class and they tell her, "don't bother with us, we're all losers," you can see everything that's coming twenty miles away for the rest of the film. all the usual suspects are here. besides the spunky teacher, we have a group of what are supposed to be endearingly bratty kids (they're brats, yes, but no so endearing), a slow-witted small town sheriff that they love to torment, an arrogant head coach of the winning rival team, etc., ad nauseum. only olivia d'abo as the new teacher displays any likabilty. i never cared much for steve guttenberg before and his performance as the sheriff doesn't change things. jay o. sanders is a capable actor but his character, the rival coach, leaves him nothing to work with. let's hope that writer/director holly goldberg sloan comes up with something better next time out.

how many movies are there going to be in which against all odds, a ragtag team beats the big guys with all the money?!!!!!!!! there's nothing new in "the big green". if anything, you want them to lose. steve guttenberg used to have such a good resume ("the boys from brazil", "police academy", "cocoon"). why, oh why, did he have to do these sorts of movies during the 1990s and beyond?! so, just avoid this movie. there are plenty of good movies out there, so there's no reason to waste your time and money on this junk. obviously, the "green" on their minds was money, because there's no creativity here. at least in recent years, disney has produced some clever movies with pixar.

also titled--> the magical castle--> this one is a stretch. why bother? why create another rockbart and then add another story line that has nearly nothing to do with the play nor swan lake. only some girlfriend of rockbart, the stolen book of forbidden arts and the original characters (not voices remain). stripped to to its bares this is a continuation by a thread. next thing you know some bird will have memorized the "forbidden arts" and swan princess 4: the magical bird will be born. thankfully though the chapters are supposedly closed and this will beginning but bad ended trilogy will come to a close.

i loved the first movie, the second one was okay, disappointed john cleese wasn't jean bob anymore as hes my favorite character. but the third one...what happened to the animation??? it looks low budget like a sat morning cartoon! except for the flashback which was taken from the first movie. they really should have stopped after number 2, this just makes the rest look bad!! derek's voice has changed but its not as recognizable as jean bob..rogers also looks very strange. i also don't understand where rothbart came from. i thought he died! this movie made me want to turn it off, as much as i love the first one, i was very disappointed with this installment. they will never beat the original!:)

i had to rent a couple of movies for my little cousin for new year's and she picked out the swan princess: the mystery of the enchanted kingdom and the little mermaid 2 and we just watched both films, while she's sleeping, i figured i could get a couple comments in. :) while this is a very cheesy cartoon, it really wasn't that bad. you have to admit that for children, these plots are new to them and it could be a great introduction of these stories to them.odette finds out that derek has been secretly keeping the magic secrets of rosthoe and she tells derek to destroy them immediately, but him being a guy, typically he does not do so and tells her that no on could achieve the magics without his help. when a witch named zelda gets her hands on them, she finds out that derek tore off the last words of a spell she wants to use to destroy everything, and she kidnaps odette in order to retrieve this information.the swan princess: the mystery of the enchanted kingdom is silly and predictable, but for the kids i would honestly say it's a go. it's so rare we have these clean cut cartoons now a days, so i'm going to cut the film some slack. it was just weird seeing all the voices change all of a sudden, i grew up with the first one, so i guess it was just stuck in my head.4/10

i am the sort of person who never, ever watches animated movies, but i make an exception for thumbelina and the swan princess. being absolutely in love with the first installment of the series, i bought this and sat down to watch it with a very biased mind, determined to love it because i'd spent money buying it. i finished the movie, and all i can think is the horror!!! i wanted to like it, i really did. i tried very, very hard to like it. but i couldn't enjoy a second of this grueling film. the songs made me feel like ripping my ears out of my head. the dialogue was so lame i felt myself twitching with frustration and irritation every time someone opened his or her mouth. the villain was laughable and i felt myself wanting derek and odette to die in the end... and i was absolutely in love with them from the first film.i am going to try repress the memory of this movie, because it almost destroyed the first one for me. there is one song in the movie in which there are a series of flashbacks to the first film. the difference in animation between the two is made very obvious, and i began yearning for the first one and wishing i'd never set eyes on the third.do yourself and favor and don't waste your time.

i think my summary says it all. this mtv-ish answer to the classic candid camera tv show features a gen x (or is that gen y) type putting in false choppers and wearing various hats and wigs and glasses, and setting people up in fairly outlandish although often not very interesting situations. example: kennedy has a guy invite his parents to his "wedding." kennedy is the bride, done up in a full bridal gown and long wig. the "joke" is that the parents immediately understand their son is marrying a man who claims to no longer have his "bits and pieces." problem is, this schtick goes on way too long, obviously to fill out time. and kennedy is about as funny as a dead cod lying in the sun. candid camera would have run three or four scenarios in the time it took kennedy to get through this one, running around, constantly asking "do i look fat?" i recognize the show was not made for me. it was made for 12-year-old pinheads who think jackass is the height of comedy today. so let them laugh. thank god the show was short-lived.

wow, was this version of the racketeer tough to watch! while none of the other reviews have mentioned this, the public domain version i watched was seriously flawed. the sound track was off by about 10 seconds--meaning the dialog and action never came close to matching. so, you'd hear something occur well before you saw it--a very confusing proposition! the worst is where you hear a gun shot and only later doe the guy get hit and slump to his death in a taxi.while this seriously marred the film, it also made concentrating on the dialog easier--and showed the serious shortcomings of it as well. the dialog was simply awful--often delivered with almost no inflection or feeling. as one review said, it was like watching a high school play. part of this is understandable, as sound was a new medium, but this film's dialog was bad even compared to other 1929 films--really bad. and, like many of these early sound films, the film was just too talky--with sappy and overly melodramatic language and just not much action. and you'd think with a title like "the racketeer" that there would be some action!! however, it's really a sappy romance--with very little action.the film finds carol lombard straddled with an alcoholic musician. she herself ends up stealing to try to take care of him--and the crook, robert armstrong, comes to her assistance. when armstrong catches her cheating at cards, he covers for her and then helps the drunk brother to get on his feet--and naturally he falls for her in the process. the problem is that once the drunk sobers up, he, too, wants lombard and she needs to choose between them. wow...a recovering drunk or a mobster...talk about a couple great prospects! overall, it's a bit hard to rate considering the lousy print i saw. however, even if you ignore this, the film has a lot of problems due to its poor use of dialog and excessively talky nature. and...it was sappy too boot.

carole lombard stars in this transition period film. this film is a typical example of a very early "talkie" (first practical sound film was "the jazz singer", 1927). overall, the acting in this film tends to be extremely broad and very melodramatic.the viewer may easily note that the actors are still "acting" for a silent film, and this combined with the overly pronounced, overly earnest dialog (it seems most likely a diction-elocution-drama coach was employed extensively to teach the "silent" actors to speak lines), creates some rather comical scenes which were not at all intended to be comical.carole lombard's later great acting ability is all but unrecognizable underneath all the broad gestures, melodrama, and eager earnestness.mainly interesting as an historical curiosity of the period, and for it's completely unintended comedy-camp value.

time has not been kind to this film from the transition days of sound from silent. the plot has a gangster falling for a socialite who wants to help the down on his luck violinist she loves. there are of course complications. the problem with the film for me is that it hasn't aged well. performances are all over the place with some emotional scenes seeming so over the top as to be laughable. one late exchange where carol lombard throws someone out of her room had me howling with its sing song delivery. there are other times when the film becomes static, a sign of the limitations of the microphones. its not a bad film, its just that the technical limitations of the film get in the way of real enjoyment. normally i'm forgiving, but this time out i just couldn't go with the flow (then again the copy i saw was absolutely horrible). worth a shot in a forgiving mood (and to be reminded that robert armstrong actually did more than play carl denham in king kong)

"the racketeer" stars carol (deprived of the "e" that usually appeared at the end of her first name) lombard as a woman thrown out of society because she left her husband for a concert violinist (roland drew) who has since become a down-and-out alcoholic, and torn between her love for him and the interest of new york crime kingpin robert armstrong (top-billed). it's virtually a compendium of what was wrong with the earliest talkies: stiff direction, immobile cameras, stagy acting and ridiculously slow-paced delivery of lines. at the time the sound crews were telling the directors to have their actors speak every line s-l-o-w-l-y and not to start speaking their own line until after the previous actor had finished theirs. done about five years later, this could have been an interesting movie, but director howard higgin faithfully follows his sound recorder's dictates and systematically undercuts the talents we know lombard and armstrong had from watching their later movies. "the racketeer" was made in 1929, a year that despite the transition problems from silent to sound nonetheless gave us some legitimate masterpieces  vidor's "hallelujah!," mamoulian's "applause," wyler's "hell's heroes," capra's "ladies of leisure"  all from directors with strong enough wills to tell the soundboard dictators to get stuffed and let their actors talk and act naturalistically. too bad howard higgin wasn't that strong; as it is, watching a naturally rapid-paced actor like armstrong slog through the part in the ridiculous way he's been told to speak, one can't help but wonder where that 50-foot gorilla is when armstrong needs him.

if you find the depiction of violent murders and wanton police brutality expressed in a plot less film with glacial pacing entertaining, then you're bound to enjoy surveillance. this film was garbage for both the mind and spirit. the notion that this is a "thriller" is comical; that would imply some kind of tension and twists. you kept waiting for the story to actually finish "starting". it never rises above a glorification of weak-minded violent criminals and individuals from all walks of life. picture all of the violence of "no country for old men" without any kind of chase or sympathetic characters. thrill-killers run amok. the acting is good, mostly, but the script is a pile. don't bother, and tell your friends to don't bother.

this p.of s. was highly recommended to me by two friends that have great(similar to mine) taste in films and have seen more than anyone i know.i have no idea what they saw in this movie. sadistic,cruel and repulsive is fine in an entertaining movie,but this is a windbag effort trying to pass itself off as highbrow lowbrow movie making.or is it lowbrow highbrow?the ancient generation gap cliché "no redeeming social value" comes to mind. bill pullman is trying,maybe a little to hard,and except for the kid the rest of the acting seems self-conscious and kinda lame.save yourself from this and watch a double feature of "in cold blood" and "the hitcher".as somebody said, this would never have been made if jennifer lynch was not the overrated david lynch's daughter.

after a very scary, crude opening which gives you that creepy "chainsaw massacre"-feeling, everything falls apart.spoiler alert: as soon as the two fbi-officers start jabbing, you know they are the real killers. anyone who have seen enough of these "fooled-ya"-movies can figure this out.this movie is mader with one thing in mind: to depict brutal murders. why, then, is not the little girl tortured and murdered as well? will this be next for us movie-goers? the torture and abuse of children? whats wrong with you people? lynch is truly has a disgusting, ugly mind.

this is a snuff movie. i'm shocked it is even considered to be in the imdb library. and, bill, julia, and all other "professional" actors involved should be ashamed to be part of this sick flick. i thought i was going to view a somewhat classic horror film with a creative end that writers like to invent....that usually make no sense when writing a horror film, but as a viewer, we try to rationalize and understand. this ending was not creative. it was sick and has all the earmarks of a snuff movie. i am shocked it was edited to this ending, and more shocked that it will be out for distribution by the end of june 2009. it should not be shown in a theater. it is harmful to innocent minds on many levels....watch the movie, the ending, and you will understand this statement. plus, included in the plot is a sweet little girl "not yet 9" her character says. she is not in the snuff ending, but she is an integral part of the movie. why do directors feel they need to shock with a sick flick in order to get recognition? the director is in the wrong line of work if she thinks this is an art film.

i am not sure who recommended surveillance to me, but i think i have an idea: one of the "fat guys at the movies." the person said they were astonished by how great it was and said it was one of the goriest/disturbing movies. (i'm paraphrasing and doing this only by memory, so forgive me if i misquoted.) at any rate, i made the decision to watch it. so i take full blame for my own miscalculation in watching one of the most horrible, predictable and stupid movies i've ever seen. strange, i doubt i've ever called a movie "stupid" but that was the first word that came to mind about one-third in and stayed in my mind until the end.where to begin? unbelievable premise and reactions, incredibly brain-dead characters (could blame the writing or the actors, or i'll just blame both) and enormously bad acting. i'd sooner believe bill pullman as president of the usa than a fbi agent here. (of course, there's a reason for that, and i'll partially go into that.) and to top it off, if you can't figure the so-called shocking "twist" in the first 5 minutes, then you must have arrived late to the theatre or came into the room to watch it late. don't worry, they'll tell you the "twist" every five minutes thereafter.there's been some serial killer(s) on the loose in the most depressing town in the county, or world. but there's more to the story! some dumbass and corrupt cops like to blow out tires for their own amusement. could there possibly be more? oh, yeah, there's a family, well maybe not, but there are four humans, one boy, one girl and an adult couple. the girl says she sees things with much less conviction than cole sees dead people in the sixth sense. there's gotta be more to this than what i mentioned! that's what makes a movie interesting! adding as many subplots that may/may not be developed is the way to go! okay, then i'll continue. we have goofy fbi agents that made me laugh. a pair of giggling druggies who's shocked at first their dealer od's but then resorts to robbery. a gosh-tooting great-guy cop who must've been put in for comic relief who's always battling an angry/suspicious cop. and finally, (poor, poor) michael ironside who didn't just phone his performance in, he barely text it in.none of these work. they're all told in various forms of presence tense or flashbacks, and believe me, you'll lose all sense of caring after the first of many subplots begin. in addition, the reaction some of these characters are the most shocking of all. i guess i'm referring mostly to the cops, but mainly the girl who did or did not just lose her family and barely blinks.this stupid, stupid movie stinks. it's barely gory as the person that recommended it said it was, unless his exposure has been limited to goosebumps stories. and what's with the title? surveillance? oh, i get it; it's because it was used in 1/50 subplots just to film interviews. since that's so random, it might as well been called cop car, bullet or coffee. just stay away from this horrid mess.

this movie was *good* relatively during the first parts of it.we have a story, from 3 points of view. so let's find some clues and complete the story.oh wait...none of that stuff matters because the fbi guys are the bad guys! though that was a great twist...it was almost a terrible twist. i immediately downgraded the film from a 7 maybe 8 to 3 based on the last 10-15 minutes of it.does anyone else not see why the twist is so bad? yes, it's a good shock. but it is bad because it has absolutely nothing to do with the preceding hour and twenty minutes. there's no connection to the killers.the killers are in about all of 5 minutes of this movie (as killers) and the two fbi agents are only in 15 minutes of the previous hour and twenty.we get it...surveillance...oh, the killers are voyeurs. which makes no sense, because they were only described in limited terms as just being psychopaths. and the hour and twenty minutes of surveillance we are watching of the 3 stories goes out the window as everyone is dead in 5 minutes.all of this makes the ending even more ridiculous. oh, they killed a bunch of fbi agents in the beginning...what fbi agents sleep together? all in the same room. to be found and murdered by amateurs and then impersonated by people who know nothing about being fbi agents? a cop 3 feet away apparently can't hit either one with a standard police issue pistol that can shoot several shots. i hate movies that try to make you feel like this could be real when they make absurd leaps they think we will believe.the other thing is the movie ends about 10-15 minutes after they are revealed as the killers with a girl standing in the field somewhere...

significant spoilers! this is a sick, disturbing movie... just like the sick, twisted director, jennifer chambers lynch who also wrote it. i don't even know why i gave this movie a rating of 2. it is not the fault of the actors for sure. the cast certainly portrayed their roles well. it is the way this movie was written and the way the characters were written which was the benchmark of a truly sick mind.i do know that i will never, ever watch another movie which has been written or directed by jennifer chambers lynch. she is a sick, twisted, foul-mouthed, foul-thinking deviant. she looks, speaks and sounds like some biker chick with her brain fried on drugs, who spent 20 years doing hard time. you can clearly see what kind of person she is by watching her on the dvd special features section of "surveillance: the watched are watching." you can see and hear her for yourself. she was every bit as bad as i had envisioned from the writing of this movie.i'm not shocked by bad language, although this director certainly talks like a sailor. this goes far beyond simple bad language; worse than any p0rn film. the level of implied sado-violence and perversion she incorporates into every character she writes are of the genre which is even illegal by p0rn standards. this perverse, disturbing thinking is clearly apparent in her own personality and things she says. another reviewer found the description i was seeking. this is a snuff film.be sure to listen to her narration on the deleted scenes and alternate ending. this director/writer is truly a sick person. i can't believe anyone would put her in charge of a movie, much less pay her for it. you can be assured that i will never, ever watch another movie she has been affiliated with. in the thousands of movies i have watched and collected, there are only a couple directors and writers which have merited this kind of boycott. she is offensive beyond anyone i have ever seen connected with filming a movie before. there have been some bad directors and writers, but none could compare to her sick, twisted mind.when i saw this movie, which was just one murder rampage after another. once it got past the hotel murder... then the sick cops shooting at and brutalizing drivers for kicks... the vacation family with the bad parents (who had no business being in the presence of children)... followed by the drug addicts.... the movie then proceeded to the (even more) twisted, deviant serial killers.as i saw the serial killers reveal themselves, i began to wonder what kind of truly sick mind wrote this movie. those were my actual thoughts as i watched this movie. i fully intended to find out what writer had such a sick mind... because that writer seriously needs to be committed for long-term psychiatric treatment. to my surprise, it turned out to be the director. when i saw and heard what she had to say on the dvd, i realized my assessment of the writer was right on the nose. on the dvd, she was indeed the sick, twisted person i had envisioned writing such a disturbing film.while the little girl, (stephanie) ryan simpkins, truly stole the show... i can't believe that her real-life parents would have tolerated this sick, foul-mouthed, director to be anywhere near their daughter.this movie is disturbing, sick, offensive, twisted and the director-writer needs some serious treatment in a mental facility.as far as the ending of the movie goes... the alternate ending, should have been the outcome of this horrific ordeal. there was no point and no benefit to the film or the story or the flow of the film by the death of the other character. i'm stunned that any studio actually distributed the movie. the trailer was completely misleading. the only reason the movie got the audience it did was due to the clever wordsmithing and creative depiction on the trailer. that trailer is not representative of the movie you will see.other than the child... every character in this movie was a sick, murderous, twisted, perverse, violent sex freak and their characters are mirrored the mind of the writer-director who created them. but if you watch it carefully, even the parents of the vacationing family; the sick cops taking pot shots; the serial killers posing in alternate roles; cops in the station; and even the station dispatcher... every single one of these character roles incorporated a sexually, twisted, violent pervert. i'm not too sure about some of the actors after watching them talk about the filming of the movie and the canadian town in the special features section of the dvd.this writer-director has such a personal mental deviation that no matter what she writes, every character role contains those same carbon copy stamps. the only character which did not have these deviant tendencies was the child. watch closely and you will see this in every character. then listen to the director-writer talk on the dvd special features section and you will understand what i'm telling you about her mental state and psychological issues. she wouldn't be tolerated in too many decent homes if she were not from a hollywood film making family.fortunately, jennifer chambers lynch does not have much of a filmography... less than a handful of things. since she carbon copies those disturbing traits in all of her character roles, i don't think we'll have to see many movies written or directed by her unless her dad, director david lynch helps her out. i'd recommend staying away from any movie she is involved with... and i'm not too sure her dad's films would be any better.do yourself a favor. avoid anything written or directed by jennifer chambers lynch.

i went to the cinema to watch a preview of this film without knowing anything about it. recognizing jennifer lynch's name and seeing the 18 certificate i realised it might be disturbing. in actuality i found the film a farce. i found myself giggling in disbelief through parts of it. the acting is atrocious- bill pullman and his ridiculous twitching face. i do almost pity the actors though as the script offers them no chance of any believable character interaction. after some shocking incident, (there is plenty to "try" and shock the viewer in this film), 2 characters are seen sharing a beer and talking about the weather. everything was overstated, or thought it was being clever when really it was obvious! the performance from the little girl character named stephanie was the best thing about the film. quiet and intense. i really could not recommend this film to anyone. its violent without point, ridiculous characters, bad acting, bad script and plain silly.

i must say, when i saw this film at a 6.5 on this site, i figured it was well worth a view. i was sorely disappointed. from nearly the opening scene, it is obvious the two supposed fbi agents are, in fact, the killers. could they have made it any more obvious? if that is the intended "twist" in this film, that's pretty sad. while pullman and ormond are excellent actors, even their talent is no match for a reprehensibly bad script. pullman adeptly acts the part of a sociopathic killer... and that's the problem. there is no switch from "i'm playing fbi guy!" to "i just killed 12 people and boy, are my arms tired." you can't blame the actors... the story fails in far more ways than one.from the onset of the film, however, i was certain i was wrong, that no director/writer would ever be so blatantly obvious about a plot "twist." ormond and pullman must just be acting strangely in order to divert the viewer's attention from the real killers, i thought... which gave the film's makers far too much credit. i should have followed my instincts and turned off the movie before it even made it past the 15-minute mark.to lynch's credit, she did manage to interject many things that make a good film: sex, violence, humor, and well-trained actors. too bad they were in the wrong configuration. hopefully pell james can recover from this role... i found her performance particularly impressive, as the stunning drug addict-turned would-be savior. she should have rewritten the role so the "crack whore" would win.those people who have compared this film to natural born killers, take note: tarantino made the characters of mickey and mallory reprehensible, yet sympathetic. the artistry of that film far overpowers the gore, and this is not seen once in surveillance. surveillance only wishes it were natural born killers... in fact, it has wet dreams about being even a fraction of what that film was. folks who haven't seen surveillance... stick to something with a little more intelligence. like camp rock.

the film's executive producer is none other than that messenger of peace thru transcendental meditation, david lynch, the director's father. i wonder what david's guru, his holiness maharishi mahesh yogi, would have thought of this production. the hypocrisy here is as repugnant as is the film itself. it's a safe bet that samuel l. dieteman, phoenix serial killer and devotee of recreational violence, would have loved every minute of it.i doubt if many would fault this film for its cinematic craft; on that level it's quite good. but on a moral level, it's the most disheartening movie i've ever seen.spoiler comingi guess it's the phoniness of the thing that saddens me the most. morally-numb generation xers learn a craft and a little post-modern aesthetic theory at art school or film school and then get involved in the arts-and-entertainment industry; and here's the result: a film which wallows in human suffering, injustice and carnage, much of which is witnessed by a nine-year old who sees her entire family brutally murdered by a couple of recreational-violence killers who, at the end, ride off into the sunset.no more spoilers comingfor whom are films like this produced? narurally, sadists are going to adore this - why wouldn't they? but who else? as i noted above, there's some really good film craft here, but good craft can be applied to any subject matter. why apply it to stuff like this? also, the movie is very suspenseful, but that's not because of the graphicness & grossness of the violence; it's suspenseful because it's well-directed & well-acted. i'm sure the ghost of alfred hitchcock could explain this much better than i can.so what has been put before us here? and above all, why? yes, our world can be an ugly, dirty, even evil place, but shouldn't we dissent when an "artist" makes it her/his business to rub our faces in it? or worse still, to stick it in the faces of those nine-year olds who will, one way or another, end up seeing this on home dvd? i hope that people will see to it that this film is not seen by their kids. yeah, i know - dream on, bernon...

sorry for all you guys that are not family with the lynches.my sister in law asked me how you can make just a disturbing movie. i told her that if the daughter and her father would not do these movie, they would have instead to go around and kill and cut people in pieces.after every lnych movie i tell myself, again one and a half hour lost of my life. but next time i will check the director's or producers name.so, you don't want to be angry at yourself and loose time, don't watch it. but if you think that you need to kill someone, watch it, this is probably a better medicine than to spend your whole life in a prison for mentally insane.

this must be the worst thriller i have seen in a long long time. the directing, the acting and the adaptation of the story leave what could probably have been a good plot into a meaningless waste of time. within a few minutes of watching the film it was easy to figure out the whole plot and then there are more obvious clues very early on leaving no mystery. i guessed this within the first few minutes and i kept hoping i was wrong and much to my dismay i was not.the film starts off with two fbi agents who drive to a remote town to investigate a murderous spree which has left three witnesses, a young girl, a drug addict and a cop. they are interviewed under surveillance cameras separately and each tells their account of the day. each has something to hide about themselves and the day unfolds as they tell their accounts. this part is probably the saving grace and if developed could have made this film better.spoiler: the whole story ends in the fbi agents being the actual killers and the young girl is the only one who has figured this out and so left unhurt by them.why do they go through the whole charade of interviewing three witnesses and bonding with the young girl if their idea had been to kill them in the first place? how did they get away with pretending to be fbi agents (when you discover that real fbi agents had been killed and their badges were found on them)? how did they know how to set up and use the surveillance cameras?bill pullman and julia ormond are so unconvincing from the beginning to the end. maybe the idea is to develop their characters for the revelation at the end. come on, they both look ridiculous, stupid and not sinister in the least. the character of the young girl is also wasted potential. there is no meaning to her actions and no meaning to whom she prefers to bond with in her ordeal. she does not appear distressed, but rather detached which again is not explained. awful film on the whole.

i do not know what today's movie goers expect, but after 68 years of movie watching.. (well maybe i didn't watch many movies in the first 9 - 10 years, so make that 58 years of movie watching) i expect to be entertained, not bored to tears, assaulted by continuous profanity (every other word) and idiotic scenes of violence that are presented in with no other purpose in mind but to show blood splattering and body parts being mangled. surveillance is one of those movies that was made by people who have no imagination, little if any talent, a total inability to tie scenes together and an unreasonable trait of letting a scene go on and on, long after the purpose for it has elapsed. that anyone would ever think that this was a worthwhile movie, when it is nothing more that hollywood garbage is beyond me. as a combat veteran i have seen violence, blood and gore, in many forms, and movies like we were soldiers is about as violent as a movie can get, but it has redeeming value. surveillance must have been dreamed up by persons in a drug induced stupor, with no writing ability, no directorial training, no experience in film editing, and a total lack of contact with reality. just a stupid movie of two serial killers posing as fbi agents, setting up a scenario to kill some stupid foul mouth cops, etc.. a high priced piece of garbage that only an idiot could like...

without a doubt, the biggest waste of film of the year. this movie is poorly structured, sadistic, cruel and filled with unlikable characters. on top of that, and maybe the worst crime, it's uninteresting and vastly predictable. as soon as bill pullman's character doodled on the photo changing the word from "evidence" to "violence," i had the entire plot figured out. there are no surprises and there is no compelling reason to watch this trash. the only redeeming feature for me is that i saw this thing for free on my hdnet cable and didn't waste any money. i would truly be angry if i had paid to see it in a theatre.anyone that labels this thing a thriller really needs to get out more. an awful, awful film in every way that matters.

in the european tv industry, movies like this one are called "stickers". tv stations buy them and air them because when they wanted to buy broadcast rights to, let's say, titanic, some not-really-blockbusters were a part of the deal.14 hours is a story of a hospital, its employees and patients who have to face the worst flood slash storm ever. unfortunately almost from every scene or shot one can tell that is was a low-budget film.newborn babies are very obviously not real, there is no background action and probably the worst thing is the doctor-acting. the actors are not believable in their roles: their lines, when spoken, sound way too memorized, as if this was a read-out camera test.

i work at memorial hermann hospital (tmc) and was also working at texas children's hospital, women's hospital, and west houston, during allison. first the shots of the hospital are sadly suburban. the texas medical center has a daytime population density similar to wall street!! there are huge skyscraper professional buildings and hospitals. tch was the largest children's hospital before it doubled in size, twice! methodist, with its 1500 beds is one of the largest hospital in world. the texas medical center skyline is bigger than that of memphis. yet, the best pics hollywood could muster are that of some dinky hospital in the middle of nowhere (besides the real pic of the hospital taken decades ago). also, they combined several real-life characters and portrayed them all in one (super-nurse). i actually know the medical technologist(s) working in the blood bank. two where actually working at the time but the movie shows only one pregnant mt. there was a pregnant mt, and another mt that took the precious patient antibody rolodex (research "alloantibodies" for more info). i will not mention their names (privacy). there was no nurse in the real life lab scene. hollywood combined these two techs (most likely to save time and money). in the movie, military helicopters (true) had to transfer the our babies (nicu and picu) to utmb all the way to galveston! why you may ask, when we have the largest children's hospital just down the street? because texas children's hospital refused to take them. you read right, they refused!!! being employed by them, i was ashamed. needless-to-say, i'm no longer affiliated with that facility. any other comments would be repetitive to the ones already posted by the people that who actually live here, or lived through the experience.

this movie starts off on the wrong foot and never really gets it going. the first scene shows a life flight helicopter landing and just outside the window you can distinctly see mountains in the background. for those of you who might not ever have been to houston there is no elevation change. the city sits just above sea level and a 5 ft. incline is considered a big hill. to go along with that scenery, any shots outside of the hospital immediately tell the viewer that they are not in houston. the trees are all missing leaves or are pine trees, neither of which houston has very much of. even the hospital itself, on the outside, is very unbelievable. memorial hermann hospital is one of the top hospitals in the united states and sits smack dab in the middle of the medical district just miles from downtown houston, yet every outside shot of the hospital makes it appear that the hospital is out in the suburbs or even the countryside.it is obvious that whoever was in charge of the actual tropical storm part of the movie skimped out because the numerous shots of radar are all wrong. the first radar image in the movie is that of hurrican hugo hitting south carolina. we later see kris kristofferson leaving his job and one of his assistants tells him that alison is moving back south across houston yet the radar image he shows has alison clearly moving north off of the gulf of mexico into houston...probably the initial landfall of alison.as for the acting, it isn't all that bad. jobeth williams, kris kristofferson and rick schroder all do a decent job considering that this is a straight-to-tv movie. the plot of the story is decent and the fact that it is based on a true story makes it a bit more entertaining. my one problem with the acting is the portrayal of houstonians with big thick southern accents...the actors all sound like they are from birmingham, alabama and not houston, texas.the movie gets its point across and to the general audience it does exactly what it is meant to: entertain. if you are looking for a factual account of what happened to the city of houston in june of 2001 then you will be disappointed. one thing to keep in mind before viewing this movie is that it is based solely on the evacuation of memorial hermann hospital and not on tropical storm alison and the impact on houston metro itself. if you are looking for a factual account of tropical storm alison's impact on houston metro might i suggest watching the weather channel's storm stories for tropical storm alison.*1/2 out of *****

upon a recommendation from a friend and my admiration of philip baker hall i rented the first season disc of the loop.it's a typical tv comedy with all the clichés that the genre employs with the "wacky" scheming brother (sully), "ditzy" blonde (lizzy), token unrequited love interest (piper), sarcastic asian helper (darcy, which reminded me of arliss, as if anyone needed to be reminded of that show). the plot deals with various bad luck (usually by sully) that befalls sam that puts his job at the airplane in jeopardy, only to have him save the day, with 'hilarious hijinks' ensuing in the middle. i didn't descibe a certain episode. i described them all to a t. therein lies the problem as what seems like it might even be passable entertainment at first just gets uselessly stale when watching episodes in a row and growing bored beyond belief at the endless repetition. sully will do something 'wacky', mimi rogers will say something overtly sexual, russ will tell about his gay son, darcy will do her impersonation of sandra oh on arliss blah blah blah blah blah. the only positive is the lack of an annoying laugh track. but don't let that fool you into thinking it's any good. go watch a far better comedy. arrested development, always sunny in phillidelphia, two name two off the top of my head. surprised that this one is still on the air. oh that's right fox only cancels the good shows, i forgot. needless to say i don't trust my friend's taste in shows anymore.my grade: d+

fox is pretty lame. they cancel the wrong shows. it's bizarre that they would cancel a well-written program like "arrested development" and yet they keep this show and "war at home". i feel that fox loved that they broke barriers with the then-edgy "married with children", but now it's just getting ridiculous. "the loop" is a pointless and boring watch, and their edgy jokes just fall flat. in order for edgy comedy to work you have to keep the jokes coming. "family guy" and "the simpons" work because there is a constant flow of jokes. fox needs to pull their heads out of their rectal cavities and quit letting their relatives write this mediocre tripe. i mean, if you're going to invest money into making something entertaining, make it entertaining. also, stop using "no-named" actors. it's great to have up-and-comers, but you need to anchor a show with a noted celebrity. duh, fox.

the first season was great - good mix of the job and the brother and friends at home. it was actually a pretty funny show.now it shows up again and the brother and the two hot chicks are gone -- and the whole thing revolves around the airline company. even the old man who runs the company has gone downhill - way too over the top, where before it was perfect.that and no more sarah mason - one of the best looking girls in hollywood.this is what happens when you let some execs get their hands on a show. you can almost see the meeting "the old man is funny, lets focus on him, make him way over the top and make it all about the airline.. it'll be a nutty version of the office!" anyhow, no hot chicks, no watch.

i am very open minded. i watch all kinds of programs to the end...good or bad...just to give them a chance and learn from the good aspects and bad ones. this show had potential to be good. but my god, what were the writers, casting director, and director thinking? the cast of actors are terrible...with the slightest exception of meryl (mimi rogers), and darcy (joy osmanski) being given occasional good lines with the best execution of the lot.the rest of the cast kill the show. it is the same story line in every episode. sam has plans to do something. his boss disrupts these plans by assigning him ridiculous work projects. then the foolish ways sam tries to accommodate both in a manner that is primarily stupid and lacks any real intelligent humor. this is every episode. it gets very tiring.season 2, they ditch the eye candy. the 2 "hot" girls in the show get written out (yet the brother stays? explain that casting cut to me please). i can see why they wrote them out...they had no substantial role...but they didn't add anyone better to replace them.the cocky derek tricolli character is given a continuous appearance in season 2. his acting (along with everyone else's) resembles many poor sitcoms from the 80's...might have been funny then...but painful now.the show could have been so much better with a few good writers and some people who had any talent to execute them. this show lacks everything. production quality is the only good aspect of the show. it is great in that regard...unfortunately the content is painfully sad.my god. fox, was there really nothing better to choose from? i'm sticking with shows like "it's always sunny in philadelphia" or "30 rock" for now. the bar should be set by programs like these that actually assume the audience are intelligent and aren't continually drooling on themselves using all their brain power on continuing to breathe.

i love this show. i watched every episode last year. i bought the dvds. and i tune into to watch tonight and i see for some reason you have retooled this great show. and you have taken what made it work and ruined it. you took one of the best aspects of the show away which was the 4 friends. sam, sully, lizzy and piper. i love the other characters as well, but they are good in small dozes like derek, darcy and even sully. it is like the show lost some of its family and everyone else is trying to hard to fill in. it is overdose. while things are funny in small dozes when you are exposed to it all the time it goes from funny to annoying. i was so looking forward to the return of this show. so please bring back the charm. even if you could not fit piper into the show at least bring lizzy back. but i loved those girls. they brought the fun. the show was about sam trying to live his business life and handle his personal life and friends as well. that was the charm. and that great dog as well.i hope the network (fox) forced the writers to do this and the writers did not willingly do this to the show. i will give the show a couple more episodes before i give up, but tonight's episodes were bad. i made a big deal out of the show returning tonight and had people over and i felt like a fool, because no one was laughing except 2-3 times. i apologized to them and said i don't know what happened. and about 10 minutes into the episode i realized they were not going to show piper or lizzy and this was no longer a must see tv comedy.

wow, there are no words to describe how bad this movie truly is. i usually pride myself on being able to enjoy any movie no matter how bad, but this was just too much. i would only suggest watching this movie as a torture device. if you can get past the terrible plot and dialogue by watching it on mute, the even more terrible camera work and shoddy special effects make this movie a real horror. if your thinking about watching this because your a sandra bullock fan, don't even bother as she has less than ten minutes of screen time, and her acting is absolutely atrocious. not to mention the rest of the cast, which could be replaced with baboons who would do a better job, at least then we wouldn't have to listen to the terrible dialogue.

don't worry when looking at the cover of the dvd, sandra bullock only appears at most 5 minutes in total in this cult classic. the entertainment value here is very high. to name but a few of the many highlights that should be paid attention to:- the doubled evil voices of the chief bad guys - the special gun cam - the weird masks and outfits of the hit killers - the showy ways to catch a bullet and hit the ground - the abundance of bottom-up shots - the spacey scene in which bullock falls unconscious on the street - the over-cliché italian mob guy moe (lamotta) - the cheap synthesizer background music - the mesmerizing overdone gun fetishismand last but not least: the super corny fist-fight scenes. wish there would have been more of those...extra point for the successful attempt at making me laugh out loud.

oh boy! oh boy! on the cover of worn out vhs has a picture of sandra bullock and her name written on top. i think only reason they had chance to sell the movie in nineties, was because of sandra bullock's name. bullock's fans don't have to disappoint. sandra is only thing to watch in this movie and her performance is the only you can call acting. rest of the movie it's fun to watch in first fifteen minutes because it's bad but after that it's going worse. much worse. directing is awful. acting is awful. script is awful. dialog is awful. action is awful. music is quite good actually. typical score for eighties action movies. this movie is so bad that it goes close to anything andy sidaris has ever produced. it's so bad that there isn't proper word to describe this poor attempt to be a movie. but still, there was sandra bullock. and super cool (sarcasm) jake lamotta who tried to be marlon brando. i think they can now bring the film out on dvd. it could be cool! and they should write on the cover: academy award winner sandra bullock in hangmen1 out of 10

the prior comments are way to generous. this movie is a waste of electricity and plastic. on the other hand, i have had a great deal of fun giving it to friends to watch and describing it beforehand as "beyond belief!" "no words can express how i feel about this" "this movie will move you" as expected, the friends took these nondescript comments as enthusiastic endorsements. they were wrong. the sadistic pleasure i had foisting this on people was well worth the $5 i paid for the movie. on the other hand, one (former) friend says i owe him 90 minutes of his life back. i particularly enjoyed the "gun's eye view" of parts of the movie. truly awesome in it's absurdity.

the dvd release of this movie hopes you will buy this movie on the name and face of sandra bullock. her picture (from years after this film) basically is the cover art... and the back cover art... and the inside cover art... the same picture. her name is prominently shown on the front cover, all 4 edges and the disk itself. she is the first name in the list of stars. her biography is printed inside the case. this film must revolve around her character, right? wrong! it is her first movie and she plays a minor role. after watching the movie, every role seems like a minor role. the character dog actually displays some personality. less than an hour after watching it, i don't even remember the names of many characters.maybe if i watched it several more times, i could actually figure out the plot, but i don't think it would be worth the effort.oh, wait, i just remembered a funny bit! shoot-em-up video game fans will get a kick out of the "doom-cam". looks just like a first-person shooter game. hands and gun pointing out in front of the camera.i am generally not a person to be critical of movies, but this may be the worst movie i have ever seen. i kept expecting some silhouettes to walk across the screen, sit down and start making fun of it.i'm just glad that the money we spent on this (used) went to charity.

this film stinks more than limburger cheese! if you find this at a garage sale, leave it there! i love sandra bullock and yet hate this movie... although ashamed, i do own a copy, and the studio has changed the cover to play on the fact that sandra bullock is in this at all. they play it up to be "a sandra bullock movie". she only has a small part in the whole movie and she does her best with that, but she is young and had not learned her talent yet. well everyone has to start somewhere...

i broke my own rule buying this movie from the $5.88 bin at walmart. basically, if a movie has a big star in it, and you've never heard of it before, it's usually for a reason. well in the case of this movie, the reason is because it sucked! they plaster sandra bullock's photo and name all over the cover of the dvd as bait, and it reeled this little fishie right on in. i was thinking of donating the disc to charity, or giving it to the library, but i don't think i would want to subject anyone else in the world to this movie. worst lines: "what do you mean army buddies?" "what do you mean your dad?"

even worse then the incredibly boring "the exorcism of emily rose". it started off decently, and right up until the mom said to the dad, "see i knew she was possessed", in an i told you so voice. it was a terrible line, spoken badly and it foreshadowed the rapid demise of this amazingly bad movie. every family member has an issue from the past with the priest. the dad starts to accuse everyone of either liking his wife, or actually having an affair with her, culminating with him killing his buddy, then himself in the obvious instant lucidity after he realizes his friend hadn't slept with his wife after all. people are dying, others are coming under possession, and by this point most viewers don't even care anymore. except for their employee miguel, none of the characters in this movie was actually likable, making it hard to care, about any of them. the acting was terrible and the writing even worse. glad i saw it for free; although i feel that for a movie this bad someone owes me money for the time i lost.

ok, i normally don't add comments on movies, but i finally watched a movie that was so utterly full of bullsh*t and riddled with incompetence that i just had to warn people about. blackwater valley exorcist is loosely about a wife-beating/pederast/priest and this podunk family of horse freaks, and to make a long story short the youngest daughter who was molested by the priest but in love with the hillbilly ranch hand gets possessed. along with a heroic god shunning mexican gardener who once participated in a exorcism, the wife-beating/ pederast/priest manage to save the day, but not before the possessing demon is able to jump over to a hooker who the town sheriff made blow him. all in all this movie is the biggest pile of useless (i could get very descriptive with this part but why waste my energy on this movie)sh*t i've ever seen. any and all persons associated with the making of this movie should be sterilized so that they cannot pollute the earth with their useless spawn.

a girl named isobel becomes possessed by a demon. the local priest (who formerly dated isobel's sister) must try to save her, but the bigger problems are with the family's suspicions of each other rather than the demon in their daughter.this film is directed by ethan wiley, the writer of "house" and the writer/director of "house ii". i loved the first film and liked the second one even better, so you would think this would be a winner. alas, this one looks like it was thrown together by first-year film students. dawson leery could have done better. i have thought about blaming new writer ellary eddy, especially because the idea is hardly original (are they trying to cash in on the fans of "the exorcism of emily rose"?), but wiley should have been able to do his magic.also, you'd like to think veteran horror stars jeffrey combs and james russo would help this film. russo (playing the bishop) barely shows up, and combs has a great role as a sheriff... for the five minutes he's on screen (but i love the mustache). so, no help here.after seeing "the exorcist", all other exorcism films must be compared to the classic by default, no? and the demonic possession in this film was not scary in the least. no head-spinning or paranormal activity at all. just a girl with a deep voice and runny makeup. all the "demonic" stuff was centered around the father accusing everyone of sleeping with his wife. as another reviewer wrote, "you get a lot of isobel bouncing on her bed like it's a trampoline, hiding in her closet, and jumping from a hay-loft. yeah, it's chuck e. cheese gone wild." that sadly sums up the extent of the "evil" in this movie.if you want to watch a movie about family members who invent accusations and yell at each other while the possessed daughter sits in another room off-camera, this is the movie for you. but, if you don't mind my saying so, you have a horrible taste in film if this is what you're seeking.the plot seems to focus on the father accusing a cowboy of sleeping with his wife (who didn't, but did sleep with his daughter) and of the veterinarian of sleeping with his wife (who might have, but denies it). and then you have a gardener who attacks the possessed girl with a crucifix and tells the family to call an exorcist, but once the priest arrives the gardener declares he does not believe in god. what was all the bible-quoting you were doing five minutes ago?a horrible exorcism movie. horribler examples of what combs and russo are capable of. and such a sad display of directing after the "house" series of films became classic. i would like to pretend wiley had no part in making this shamefully derivative and unoriginal, uninspired film. the power of christ compels you to avoid this movie as if viewing it were a cardinal sin.

this movie was probably one of the worst movies i've seen in a very long time. a friend of mine grabbed it off the shelf at the video rental store, and all but forced me to watch it, an action we both deeply regret. ehh... where to start? the writing, the acting, the quality? all of it, sucked. quite possibly some of the worst writing ever displayed in a movie. the dialog was worse than i thought it could ever be in the movies. blatant dialog, such as "how ya doing?"..."not that great, doc" (directly after an attempted exorcism of a man's daughter and then his wife's attempted suicide. of course he's not that great.) was, at some points, kind of funny. if not horribly written, planned out, and obvious. the general plot of the movie, the writing and the way it worked, horrible. it was like the writers could come up with nothing better to do then write a bunch of crappy dialog and throw in as many sex and nudity scenes as they randomly could. the only almost good sex scene (between the preacher and the tattooed & peirced girl) was filmed with such poor quality that it looked more like a cheap porno than a feature film. oh yeah, and they never actually got the deed done.the acting? horrible. x100. i think the only good actor was the short spanish guy who played miguel, del zamora. and his part was written horribly. the worst acting? arguably paul kappellas, whose acting combined with shitty music, a gun, and a half naked bluish white girl running around in the woods made the movie almost unbearable to sit through. he even screwed up his own death scene, one that should have been easy to nail. although, most everybody else's acting was horrible as well.the lack of characters also added to the overall suck level of the movie. there were just enough characters so that almost half of the characters died, that same amount of people became possessed at one point, and then the remaining characters couldn't be counted on one hand. like... 50 thumbs down.p.s. what is it with the climax of exorcism movies happening in a stable, anyways?

i'm not sure if this is a comedy or not, but i found it pretty comical. isobel is possessed by the devil. somehow a perverted priest and the gardener are gonna' fix that. part exorcism and part soap opera, you'll at least get some laughs. there's the paranoid jealous dad, satanic sister, valley of the dolls mother, and then the cowboy boyfriend; all there to help the skirt chasing priest fight the demons from dear isobel. it sometimes felt like a jerry springer episode, but i actually paid to see this. instead of the cool head-twisting, sailor cursing, and crucifix humping that regan did in the exorcist; you get a lot of isobel bouncing on her bed like it's a trampoline, hiding in her closet, and jumping from a hay-loft. yeah, it's chuck e. cheese gone wild. so, if you want to watch a quote unquote horror film that is worth a few laughs while you wait for the predictable ending ... this is your movie.

the movie started very well..so far isabelle's exorcism could be believed....but later, gosh!!! i didn't know if it was a horror movie, a drama one or a must not see one! the possessed creature attacking the sheriff had no connection at all with the movie....the make up!! well it looked pretty real at beginning, but at the end, last part of movie, the make up (especially teeth and eyes) was very exaggerated. if you want a good "exorcism" movie watch "the exorcism of emily rose".together with "hard candy" (totally boring, pathetic plot and ending), these two movies are the worst i've seen from lionsgate!! but well the movie company has given horror movie fans excellent films, but with this one, you will wish you never rent it!! exorcism movie fans, just stay with two "the exorcist" and "emily rose's exorcism"

i just rented blackwater valley exorcism because the cover and pictures looked terrifying, and i don't normally watch movies that are automatically released onto dvd, but this looked so interesting and scary! i was very much in the mood for a good scary film and to me, possession is one of the scariest subjects to watch or learn about. just look at the exorcist or the exorcism of emily rose, both terrific movies that made break-throughs not only horror wise, but story as well.blackwater valley exorcism is about a girl, isabelle, who from the get go is automatically possessed, so we can't even tell what kind of a person she was to begin with. but a former wife beater turned priest is on the case with a gardener...? i know... i know. then they go into several other stories with the priest and isabella's sister, and the priest hit the sister and messed around with isabelle? i'm not sure, then we get into a story with isabelle's dad and his questioning of his wife's faithfulness to him.i mean, the story just goes into too many directions and wasn't well developed at all. not to mention that the exorcism didn't seem authentic at all and more of a just scare your pants off type of a film, which i didn't like at all because i couldn't take it seriously. whoever directed and wrote this clearly had no idea where to go or how to direct the story well, so i wouldn't really recommend this.2/10

documentaries about fans are always mishmashes, and never worth seeing through, but i found this one, made by some of the fans themselves, more than usually unenlightening. as a veteran of the original tolkien craze, forty years ago, i'd hoped for more than the obvious--which doesn't always equate to the true. if there's anyone living who doesn't already know the nature of a fandom, any fandom, from having been or known a fan, he won't discover it here. between irrelevancies, platitudes (to which the actors from the films are particularly prone), and acting out (by fans making the most--if not the best--of their one shot at fame), i could glean little of the special appeal of lotr, the special emotional responses it evokes, and the range of the special creative forms those responses can take. in addition, the film is rather lazy: it slights some facts that could have been got across with little effort, e.g. what the exact legal loophole was (the wording of a copyright notice) that permitted the books' unauthorized publication in the u.s. (speaking of which: i take strong exception to the film's dismissal of the covers on that edition as "irrelevant" and "psychedelic," which they were not. they were the work of jack gaughan, a very able sf illustrator of the period, and some fans, including me, found them more apt, and more attractive, than the covers on the rival set.)

dante would of been mortified, if he knew that his masterpiece was being acted out puppets!!! also the actors who played the puppets are sell outs. due to the fact that playing a puppet is not acting it is just basically doing nothing. no one really will care who the puppet was. people only care who played a major role in like an actual movie. this is just annoying how you could mock such an amazing man and his belief, by this dumb little movie. this should be a crime and.... i cant believe you would ruin a book like that. i thought the movie was absolutely ridiculous and should be destroyed!!!! it totally ruins what your suppose to be getting from reading it. your just making it a big joke.

this demented left-wing wipe-out trivializes dante's great work, distorts the genius of the author out of all recognition, inserts hateful ideology, incompetent satire and moronic political commentary in every imaginable place, and itself deserves a place in the eighth circle, tenth bolgia with the rest of the falsifiers. sandow birk has reserved himself a spot next to it.stocking hell with republican political figures, fox news helicopters and christian conservatives is a work of literary sacrilege, to say nothing of extreme liberal bias. it is, however, unoriginal, tedious and trite. nothing in birk's unworthy and heretical revision is in the least relevant to the original text or is in any way entertaining, humorous or enlightening, despite his smug pretension to the contrary. i could have eaten a reel of video tape and puked a better movie. i regret the two hours of my life that i lost watching this insult to the very concept of poetry. calliope will weep forever.

i was surprised to discover michael moore or bill maher wasn't involved with this "movie". an american leftist laundry list of axes to grind, with a distinct sparseness of democrats in hell. mao zedong and karl marx didn't make an appearance in hell, but ronald reagan is in the same room with hitler? perhaps we'll have to wait for these california spin doctors to butcher paradiso for them to show all of their pet ideologue political figures.cheap shots at religion, right-wing politicians, corporations and their lobbyists, fox news, even suvs. all the radical leftist talking points were too completely covered - while conspicuously omitting references to wrongdoing from the "other side of the aisle" - to not have been a conscious effort. the singular exception i noticed, in the hour and a half, is jfk has to have sex with marilyn monroe for eternity: the token inclusion in these propaganda pieces in a pathetic attempt at appearing non-partisan.

a group of young filmmakers with virtually no budget set out to make something clever and original -- and while there is a bit of originality and some skilled drawing in this slacker puppet show take on "dante's inferno," there is nothing especially clever. dante's "divine comedy" was a brilliant piece of social commentary. this film is a vaguely moralistic student film with pretensions to high art.i suspect those who loved this film were those readily amused by the sophomoric pokes at some icons of the political and/or religious right, and that those who hated it took offense at seeing their favored icons poked. be that as it may, few of those pokes actually rose to the level of satire.the high point of the movie is a sudden outbreak of "schoolhouse rock" on the subject of lobbying and the "revolving door." it's really a shame that the entire film couldn't have been a musical. that would have stripped away a great deal of the annoying film school pretentiousness and added a far stronger element of fun.

kubrick may have been the greatest director of all times. he may have made more classics than anyone else. he may have been a perfectionist. but man, was his first attempt ever bad!kubrick had good reason to try to make this film dissappear from the map: it looks like an ed wood film. it has strange narration, cheap shots, bad dialogue, ominous music reminiscent of your 50s sci-fi/horror flick, and what looks like relatives of the cast of "reefer madness" going insane for no reason.sure, you can see an undeveloped kubrick in there. it is a psychological/horror study of war. the characters became dehumanized and insane. there are people playing more than one role. there are constant shots of the faces and particular facial expressions of different people. and there are a few interesting shots around there. but really, this is a mess.of course, i am not discouraging you from watching it. if you get a hold of it, you are joining a select group of myself and a few thousand people world wide who have had access to it.

fear and desire is of interest mainly to kubrick obsessives, who can plumb this pretentious clap trap for signs of his still-to-come greatness. kubrick was right in seeking to ensure that the film was not screened or available on legitimate video. he considered it embarrassing and amateurish, and he was correct in his evaluation. this is a weak and tedious film--at 68 minutes it still seems longer than "barry lyndon"!--it nevertheless is of historical interest, and has its genuine absorbing moments. it's a difficult film to find (only "unofficial" copies are in circulation), though perhaps this may change if kubrick's estate relents and has it released on video. recommended only for kubrick enthusiasts.

stanley kubrick, a director who i hold in the highest of esteems for his masterpieces (clockwork orange, 2001, the killing, the shining, dr. strangelove, etc) took the film out of circulation, leaving it to be found by only the hardcore fans and completists. after seeing the film for myself, i could see why. at the age of 24, kubrick had already honed his craft of still photography for look magazine, and had done a few short documentaries. like many first-time filmmakers that came in the decades after him, his ambition for fear and desire was, in short, to just go and make a film, cheaply, more than likely to see if he could do it. on that level, he was successful. however, the film itself definitely is not.i can't really say that the film is a failure because there was something i did like about it throughout. even as the film's story went on the wayside, and the actors (whom kubrick didn't have any idea how to direct, not being a man of the theater), his knack for producing and capturing some great images gets its seeds in this film. at times, there are some shots of close-ups and quick-shots in suspense/action scenes that are eye-catching. unfortunately, this is all the good i can really say of the film. although there are a couple of 'name' actors in the film (frank slivera, who also appeared in killer's kiss, and paul mazursky, a director in his own right), the performances overall are dull and very routine.in fact, that is the film's main demise for me; whenever i watch any kubrick film, even his early film noirs killer's kiss and the killing, i can tell who made it, as his style by then became distinct, which would continue as he evolved as an artist. it wasn't 'artsy' like i might have pictured (which is usually the case with first-time directors like scorsese and spielberg), but watching this film not only did it feel like it wasn't kubrick, it felt like a lot of the time i was watching some b (or even c) grade movie by a director that time forgot- not quite 'ed wood' bad, but close. the music is as standard as can be, the fades are pedestrian, and the plot seems to not really hold that much attention.in short, as others have said and which i can agree, this is a "doodle pad" of a future ground-breaker, who shows some shots and a few edits that grab some attention (the best scene overall being when the soldiers take the dumb girl hostage), but not enough to really recommend except to those, like myself, who end up seeing everything by kubrick (or, perhaps, have to see every ultra-low budget war film ever made), if only out of curiosity.

this sickly sweet and laboriously paced 5-reeler is definitely not among harold lloyd's better films. gags are sparse and mostly uninspired. saccharine melodrama is abundant. the setup takes forever, as lloyd, the unconventional, but impossibly kindly, country doctor makes his rounds, bringing a little sunshine into the lives of children, the elderly, and puppies. it's like a 1922 version of patch adams. ugh. 4/10.

it's another variation on the oft-told tale of two people getting married and having to share their brood of kids. with six you get egg roll is directed by howard morris (from television) and it shows, because it's the kind of tale that plays like a half-hour situation comedy padded out to feature film length--but with a scarcity of laughs, or to put it differently, only the number of laughs that would have been possible within the half-hour limits of a tv show.doris day decided to call it quits after this film--and it's rather easy to see why. even the presence of some fairly reliable actors in the cast doesn't help. brian keith, barbara hershey, pat carroll and alice ghostley do their best, but the script is the real problem and should have been left untouched for the big screen.nothing much can be said in favor of it. skip it and see miss day in any number of her more worthwhile films.

and obviously i didn't see it! but looking at the cast and seeing that doug masters is back from the dead, i know now to avoid this like the plague! i hate it when hollywood, producers, writers, directors or all of the above think that audiences are stupid that they're not going to catch continuity errors. a supposedly dead doug masters returning is a big giant one, won't you say?and i can't believe that someone like louis gossett, jr. would return for something like that.did jason gedrick really decline this? well, i hate to say it, but even if he took the role again, it would have still had that same continuity error. i bet (if he really turned it down), he must have been incredulous seeing that his character died in the second film.i'll probably catch it by accident on a late night air on some channel, but no way am i going to rent this or buy the dvd!

louis gossett jr returns to the well one more time as chappy sinclair who goes to doug masters (played by jason cadieux who is in for jason gedrick who wisely declined) to teach a new band of recruits however this time they discover corrupt air force pilots who deal in toxic waste. this is a series that just keeps getting worse with each subsequent entry, this one however doesn't have any of the zip or even the action to make this even worth seeing on cable. iron eagle iv is directed with such indifference that the dogfights come off as if we were watching a playstation 2 game played by two lobotomized teenagers. it is horrendous to watch and gossett jr who has made his share of turkeys seems to have bottomed out here. and i saw cover-up, firewalker, aces:iron eagle iii, toy soldiers and jaws 3d. what is mysterious about louis gossett jr is that he seems to be like christopher walken in his quest to do anything as long as he's working. as i look at his post oscar win. some of his better movies include iron eagle, the punisher and the principal. considering that the latter two movies have him co-starring with dolph lundgren and james belushi it is indeed something to say that three guilty pleasure action flicks are in the running for his better work. of course enemy mine and diggstown remain his best post-oscar win work.* out of 4-(bad)

whomever thought of having sequels to iron eagle must be shot. in this case once was enough. iron eagle was a good movie to watch. even though it is unrealistic, it is still entertaining. iron eagle ii has a senseless plot and can be used to as a cure to insomnia. i didn't even bother to watch iron eagle iii, but from looking at the r rating, i assume it's more violent than the past 2 movies. well, iron eagle iv is probably the most inane sequel. lou gossett jr. returns as the always delightful "chappy" sinclair. another jason returns to fill the role of doug masters (canadian jason cadieux, who looks just like jason gedrick from the first iron eagle). but wait(here comes a possible spoiler).....wasn't doug killed in iron eagle ii? the writers must've been desprate for a story so they revived doug masters by saying he was a prisoner of the russians. this movie was the cheapest done of all the iron eagle films. why do movie makers find it neccessary to make sequels to unappealing movies? (ex. police academy movies). i have always liked gossett jr.'s work in these films. he was the only one holding this turkey together. let's hope this was the last of the iron eagle sequels. let it rest in peace.

this is a slick little movie well worth your time to find and see.it really speaks to all those mundane choices we all make every day and (like an h.g. welles story i can't quite recall) may live to want back.keep in mind that this is a short (very short). it starts out slowly but just as you begin to think it has become boring =bang= it's over. and, believe me, the 'punch line' is one you will remember.i'm not sure if the producers are going to make it available for purchase - or available on the web but either way you'd be happy you took the time to get hold of a copy - of that i am sure.

are you kidding me? the music was so loud in this show i could often not even hear the dialog. and the music was nothing great. anyone know what jake's mother said when he walked in the door??? and the mushroom cloud looked pretty close to have so little instant devastation. anyone research the effects of nuclear fallout before writing this one. i felt like a bunch of sit com actors were sent on location and didn't know what to do with dramatic dialog. and what does a kansas teen know about shopping in soho....couldn't we have had a better line here? was bored to tears and only kept awake by the jarring blare of the over-mixed way to loud music.

a family (a teenage boy, his mother and a stepdad), sick of city life, decides to move to the mountains to get away from it all and have a fresh start. however, their idyll is shattered by three brothers and their domineering father, who don't take kindly to newcomers on their patch. while having objects thrown through their window and being threatened in the street is just the start, the youth decides to make things even worse by having a relationship with the terrible trio's sister. with the law unwilling to do anything about it and the violence escalating rapidly, the lad decides to take matters into his own hands..veering wildly between hilarity and nastiness, this is one of the oddest exploitation movies ever made. at first, you can have a chuckle at some of the hammy acting and ludicrous dialogue given to the characters, especially the overwrought bad guys. but then, you get completely unnecessary scenes like a mother being raped while her son is forced to watch, or the thug's sister getting herself beaten up by her siblings for daring to sleep with our young hero. in fact, the whole view of women in the movie, which seems to be that they're pathetic creatures who scream a lot and can't defend themselves, is pretty despicable. but of course, there's the obligatory nude scene, which this time involves a young lady diving into a pool bra-less under a very thin t-shirt. who cares about plot consistency when you have some willing young starlets ready to shed her togs. right?!the climax centres on the teenager, who up until now hasn't been able to sneeze without jumping, suddenly morphing into a rambo clone and blowing off his assailants left, right and centre to save his stepfather who is being held hostage by the gang. it's completely implausible but hey, so is everything else in this film.. so at least you can't accuse it of not being consistent. so, rather than attempting to find logic in a place where the word doesn't exist, check out the imdb pages for janet laine green, dehl berti, stephen hunter, jonathan crombie.. etc. notice a pattern emerging here? their careers all hit dead ends. why? sit through this, and all will become clear. remember kids, if you want to get ahead in this business, hire a decent agent and always read the scripts they offer you. please.. 3/10

olivia d'abo in a wet t-shirt is the only thing this movie has going for it. other than that, this canadian production about a man taking out a vicious band of hillbillies is not worth anybody's time. the writing is bad, the acting is poor and the direction is sub-standard.

lonesome jim is kind of like a romantic dark comedy about a dysfunctional family whose two boys are total losers. both boys around 30, living at home, with absolutely nothing going for them. i live in the midwest and i can't name one family like this. i picked it up because i kind of like buscemi acting humor. now i realize i need to have a counteracting agent to that humor to make it work. the acting and camera work and editing was fine. the first 15 minutes got you set, and the last 15 minutes helped prevent the film from being totally depressing jerry springer trailer trash type of story. the female members of my family were begging me to turn it off, but i prevailed under the premise that there had to be a turning point near the end, and we watched the entire movie. the male family members, as expected, simply walked out after the first 30 minutes.

i was attracted to this film by its offbeat, low-key, 'real life' story line. that is, a twenty-something guy flops in the big apple and comes back home to live with his parents and even more floppy brother. it just might have worked but there's a problem. and that problem's name is casey affleck. casey affleck is nearly catatonic in this film. his acting mantra must be "exert as little effort as possible at all times". or "why speak when you can mutter?" or maybe "put yourself into a coma as soon as the camera rolls". lips moving when speaking? barely. facial expressions? none. muscles in face? atrophied. something? nothing. anything? zip.

the only time i seem to trawl through imdb comments is when i've seen a duff film. i guess i'm looking to find reassurance that it's not just me. for me, then, lonesome jim was a duff film packed with unbelievable characters in unbelievable situations which limped on lamely and boringly towards a cop-out hackneyed conclusion. so i check out what other people have to say and feel a bit like jim, out on a limb, alienated, as page after page of multiple star ratings and plaudits leave me doubting my critical faculties. yet maybe i should check the settings for the comments presentation, since after a while the gushing dies down and i'm relieved to see appreciations that mirror my own. i feel vindicated. it is a rubbish film, it doesn't hang together and it does constitute a wasted evening sitting through it. praise be to kindred spirits.

whilst this is most definitely a well crafted piece of film-making, it's thoroughly without any entertainment value whatsoever.if you're depressed already, this film will send you over the edge.if you're feeling somewhat depressed, this film will be just one more thing in your life to feel bitter about. you'll feel that it's just your luck to have chosen to watch a movie that turns out to be a complete waste of time.otherwise you might be able to make it through this film unscathed (i didn't, btw), safe in the knowledge that your life is so much better than jim's. then again you might consider that you have been fooling yourself, and that are in fact in a much worse situation than you'd previously realized. you might feel a bit annoyed at jim for bringing this to your attention. you may want to slap him around a bit with a wet fish. the sad truth is, much as i wanted to like this movie... i hated it. it took rather a long miserable road down the path of oblivion and then suddenly, for no reason whatsoever, looked back at itself and then stopped.jim does not have an epiphany, at least not one that is conveyed on screen. jim has a miserable life and a miserable set of options. he discovers nothing that one can relate to and fails to make any significant progress on his journey of self-discovery. of course no-one alive could write a happy ending to this movie. as others have said it's no hollywood tale, it's gritty and it's real. it's well made. life is quite a struggle at times. if anyone were to know "the answer", they do well to shout it from the rooftops.still, i feel cheated because this movie pretends to have something to say. you feel that it's going to say something, that if you just suffer through a little more of it, it'll have something to say. it'll make you stop and think. it doesn't.again, i do submit that this is a well crafted film. and therefore may be of value to a film student with a penchant for e.g. lighting techniques of the use of colour palettes. for the rest of us, it's utterly miss-able.

i like steve buscemi. i like his work very much, both as an actor and a director. you could say that i am -into- steve buscemi. a steve buscemi freak. i lurv steve buscemi.i remember when i first saw buscemi's full length directorial debut, "trees lounge." i enjoyed the movie, although it wasn't as good as it could have been. it was -almost- there. it -almost- scratched that itch, the itch of wanting to see "small" movies about "small" people in "small" bars that are in "small" towns. it was close enough to where i would say that it was a very good movie - one that with a few tweaks could have been great. but that's ok. i like the movie and i've watched it more than once.but this review is not about trees lounge. it's about "lonesome jim." when i saw the description of the movie and then i saw who's movie it was, i was excited at the prospect of finally seeing the movie that i knew that trees lounge could have been. but what i actually experienced was not unlike that of leaving one of those smalltown bars with a belly full of cheap whiskey and an armful of cheap floozy, heading back to your apartment with a mushy brain full of exciting prospects that inevitably disintegrate into the reality of alcohol-induced impotence and headspinning regurgitation.in other words, this movie left me flat and unrequited and sorry that i wasted the time and the money that it took me to get to that state - the film equivalent of waking up next to that cheap floozy the next morning, or if you happen to be the floozy, waking up next to that stinking and farting and unshaven imbecile. the film had all of the substance of a stale white bread sandwich (with store brand white bread, no less) and the emotion of a cadaver. i am not sure what the point of this film was, and since it was supposed to have some sort of a point and was not an exercise in abstract surrealism that can get by without one then this lack of a point is a sin of omission. sorta like those new cars that don't come with ashtrays anymore although there are millions of people who smoke and buy new cars (i'm not one of them, but hey, i can sympathize). overall it was a boring film about boring people doing boring things and had none of the grit and believability that can carry and save such a film. i mean, trees lounge was about boring people doing boring things, but it was interesting. i blame a lot of this on affleck. why do people keep casting these affleck turds? they suck the life out of anything that they are connected with. one affleck was in one decent film (and wasn't even the reason why the film was decent) and all of the sudden every butthole named affleck is stinking up as many films as they possibly can. and liv tyler is no better. being the daughter of a rock star does not necessarily make an actress. she is as lifeless as affleck. these people simply do not rise from the flat page of the script. people pay to see films and they deserve to see actors and actresses with a bit of charisma - these two duds together don't have the spark of the old guy who hands out shopping carts at wal mart. i always thought that steve buscemi was the type of guy who would rise above this type of pablum, but oh steve you let us down. this film makes me want to stuff you into another wood chipper.

i am sitting here writing this review and the movie's not even over yet. in fact, i just checked, and there are 45 more minutes to go. but no matter, there's no need to see it through to the end. i'll just write this review and laugh as the film plays in the background and stumbles onward to some kind of presumably horrible conclusion which i don't care to ever see or know.what accounts for my hostility to this movie? the characters are not believable. the plot is not believable. the pretentiousness of the movie is sickening. basically, every element of the movie rings false. buscemi obviously thought he had something to add to the dozens of movies which have already explored the well-worn themes of dysfunctional families and the apparent meaninglessness of life. however, buscemi was badly mistaken, because this movie contains nothing new. it tries very hard to be depressing, but fortunately no one can really be depressed by it, because it's obvious that no people like this exist in the entire world.what is depressing however is the knowledge that somehow this film was voted several undeserved awards. disgusting!!!! bottom line: stay away from this worthless film at all costs.

steven segal has done some awful films, but this is probably one of the best since his career took a dive about ten years ago. the cast is better than usual, and while the story and the plot are a total joke, at least most of the action scenes look pretty good.the plot is probably one of the worst in film history. someone is being executed because he stole some money? some mercenary types kidnap a supreme court justice? their goal is to exchange the judge for the prisoner so they can find out where he has the money? meanwhile the execution chamber is full of trap doors and false floors and looks like a set from one of the cirque du soleil circus shows.then there is the issue of the prison. here, the warden is a homie, played by tony plana. the prisoners all have their gang colors and signs, and the guards are there to serve the meals and keep the prison clean. nothing like a bunch of prisoners fighting and beating up some guards while the warden is watching. what happens? the warden gives them a stern talking to. he might punish them next time.there are a lot of moments in this movie that are good for laughs. however, nia peeples looks pretty good, and ja rule tries to be an action hero. lots of fun watching the prisoners all "do the right thing" and get armed so that they can free the supreme court justice from her captors. regardless of how bad half past dead may be, when you watch it keep in mind that it is easily the best movie that steven segal has starred in since under siege in 1992.

every now and then some amateur will come out with a tired piece of action film making. this one is just so wrong i don't think i even need to comment about the plot, acting, script, camera work. because it have none!! if putting a muscle guy in cool leather jacket walking in slow-mo and throw in a funky rap song is the main ingredient of making a great action movie, then sayonara action movie!!

half past dead was unlike any steven segal film i've ever seen. very little of segal, himself in action and i agree with the last review i read, nia peeples steals the show.i saw nothing really new here, just the same old stuff from other flicks changed around a little. the best action scenes were nia's as she once again kicked butt. it was interesting seeing her as the bad guy after watching her for two seasons on walker, texas ranger, still kicking butt, but for the good guys.

steven segal's movie career is a tribute to horrible cinema. i have been tragically bored with every one of them as soon as i realized that they were even more unrealistic than jean claude vandamme's. has anyone else ever noticed that he never gets hit?! i mean, give me something to root for...a hard fought battle with a bad guy who's scary. twenty years and he's still filming the same fight scenes. fight scenes can often distract you from the fact that your hero cannot act. the boring choreography of a segal film places his painful lack of acting skill in sharp relief. worse yet, he's woefully out of shape. just what we need, a fat stiff who thinks he's a leading man. there's not one iota of redeeming cinematic value in all this movies ninety or so minutes. do not watch this unless you feel like throwing away an hour and a half of your life.

i saw this movie yesterday, and like most allrdy wrote "i also expected a steven movie", god i love this guy just because his fighting style is unique and very humerous. in had a little doubts cause i read that "ja rule" was playing in it, but i thought hopefully they give him a smal role, so i don't get irritations by watching him. and offcourse the opposite happend, goooooooooooooooooooood steven what the heck were you thinking going to join a sry *** crew like this. steven was broke and needed cash? bah =( what a big dissapointment. if you like steven movie, pleaseee skip this one its pure drama, you only get a few special effects that made me vote 3/10. but the "acting?" of ja rule screws up the whole movie aswel for his buddy kurupt with his irritating hood talk.my beer went from tasting fresh to water we do the dishes in. the story didn't had any "good" about it. to me it felt like a 3 year old produced it.hopefully steven makes me happy again in a future movie. people this isn't even worth renting simpel as that.to bad and pitty :-)

(spoiler warning) i seem to keep giving this guy his last chance. strange how an action hero who once was keeps attracting an audience. anyway, this movie is about a character (seagal) being kind of a mysterious rough-neck hero. that's it.next.

this is, for different reasons, a very very bad action movie. first of all, seagal is terribly out of shape. he looks old and fat, plays like he has to fulfill an annoying obligation and his fight scenes require creative editing or plain replacement. secondly, his opponent is a very weak villain. this is about a smart and mean masterbrain and chestnut does not deliver. so what about the action ? well, the two parties permanently shoot at each other in different locations of the alcatraz jail. they shoot wild and bad, because compared to the amount of required ammunition, the bodycount is rather low. there is nothing to save this movie. there is not a single good line and not a single good joke. the little psychological interlude with 49er one and judge mcpherson is ridiculous. so what does it have? well, the usual bell helicopters, silhouettes moving in blue light and slow motion, doors riddled with bullets and 1000 watt lights shining through the holes, characters jumping through the air while shooting, loads of weapons coming from nowhere, a long black coat containing a bold black guy and a thin wooden box containing 25 tons of gold. the pain continues to the very last take, a hopeless approach to lighten up the closing credits. californian beachboy don michael paul was writing and directing. at least this mountain of boredom comes from just one simple mind.

my take: steven seagal is obviously too boring to be a lead in an action thriller, even a totally dull one. remember steven seagal? you don't? don't worry, there's not much to catch up on. after starring in admittedly enjoyable crowd-pleasing films like under siege and executive decision, seagal hits the low grounds of the bad movie abyss. now, he stars in low-budgeted b-level action vehicles, some of which are made-for-tv "movie of the week" entries that lost their way to the big screen. half past dead is among these, shall we say, dead action movies. a loud and lousy action film, sloppily directed and lazily written (and worse, badly acted). this is one of those bad movies that i don't need to watch until the ending to know it's bad. i didn't have the guts to have all my braincells die while wasting my time with this. it it this kind of bad films in which you realize, those other films you hate are not bad after all.the plot (and the locale) is completely lifted from a similar picture, michael bay's the rock, although similar may not be the word to describe it. both movies are summer movies, and not meant to be taken so seriously. but in comparison, even the rock (which isn't much in the writing department as much as the lights and sounds) has better characters, a more compelling plot, better action sequences and overall, a more entertaining atmosphere. although there are action scenes in half past dead, none of them are exciting. all of which are sometimes tedious and predictable.although predictability seemed to be a welcome asset in summer action films, predictability has never tasted more sour in ones that aren't fun, and half past dead is never really fun, a lot of times it's just a pain in the head (hearing the bad rap music repeat over and over again throughout this film makes me yearn for an aspirin every second i hear them). the acting is horrendously mediocre, the plot is derivative, with no compelling or appealing characters whatsoever. seagal's character, an undercover agent sent to alcatraz to stop a criminal mastermind (morris chestnut), a very boring villain, is nothing to get excited about. seagal's character is also provided with a sidekick (played by rap star ja rule) and a bunch of amigo inmates, and there's no chemistry going on here.if starring in a series of other forgotten action vehicles (what were those films again?) killed of seagal's career for good, half past dead is overkill. and audiences be warned: you're invited to feel the pain. advice: avoid it at all costs.rating: 0 out of 5.

as if the world needed another seagal movie. add a bunch of actors who, well... are not really actors, a bunch of heavy metal music to compliment the rap and of course, a hot looking crazy chick in leather with no hips, and we prevent ourselves from being half past budget. why, oh why do people sabotage themselves by participating in such films?fbi capture two buddies and send them to "new alcatraz," where the prison's first inmate to be executed has unexpected guests.first rate acting all around, particularly any scene involving tragedy for the good guys. seriously though, the director did try, and pulled a modern, hard edge for the movie the best he could. be he went to the well too often and half past dead gets boring too soon. what else can you do when the inmates just hang around talking while the hostages continually ask what makes the main bad guy motivated? a mindless action flick that amounts to little, if not "a-ight."

the best thing about the movie is the name, as it both describes the plot and the acting. at least they cannot say they didn't warn you... kind of like the button labeled, "don't push this".segal must have run out of things that move like planes, trains, and ships but the plot remains the same. under cover guy who fights slowly, but still beats like 40 mercenary types and doesn't even blink when doing so. what amazes me is that segal is now as big as a barn and the bad guys still cannot hit him in a hallway with a machine gun and 50 clips of ammo. where do all these bullets actually go to? the only redeeming feature of this movie is watching nia peeples pound ja rule (real name jeffrey atkins doesn't quite sound so punk) into the floor. i could spend days watching that woman kick her foot over her shoulder like that... especially wearing an outfit like that! it was just a bonus watching jeffy get is *ss kicked, and fun hoping one of those kicks actually landed. sorry, it's just time we get stupid wannabe tough guy can't act rappers out of the movies. pleeeeease! who came up with idea anyway? i'd lay odds it was the person who decided that cameron diaz and drew barrymore would pass as witty athletic angels.the only surprising twist in this movie is that they don't do the politically correct thing and have jeffy come in and save the day. no doubt if snoop (otherwise known by his momma as calvin broadus which again doesn't sound so cool when you refer to him as cal) had been in the movie, he'd throw some signs down on her and probably saved segal's life or something.

yeah, a long time ago it turned into a tourist attraction. now it's a prison again. kind of. well, it's more like an airport mixed together with a junior high school but there are lots of guys running around wearing orange jumpsuits, so i guess in that way it's like a prison. not really though. when sasha, steven seagal's character, is being admitted into prison, he's standing shackled in line and wanders over to a different line so he can talk to his friend, like he's in line for the security check at the airport. then before too long he and his friend are throwing punches, smacking around a couple of security guards.let me tell you something. you assault a corrections officer in a federal prison, they'll shoot you on the spot. ja rule would have been shot about 30 times before he threw his second punch. oh, and there are guys wearing beanies and bandanas and whatnot. in prison. federal prison.you can't dress like that at most high schools in america.speaking of ja rule, i have to say that the person who probably enjoyed his performance more than anyone else on earth, including ja rule himself, had to have been 50 cent. just before i watched this movie i saw one of those shows on tv about the greatest celebrity feuds ever, and like number 7 or 8 was this rivalry between 50 cent, who had lived the thug life for real, and ja rule. who had not. every time i saw ja rule on screen the only thing i could picture was 50 cent laughing his ass off. ja rule looks like a rowdy 9-year-old every time he appears on screen.anyway, getting back to the plot. it's funny. sasha is an fbi agent working undercover and he agrees to let himself be sentenced to prison so he can get behind the criminal organization. he's sentenced to five years, and that old line between determination and stupidity instantly vanishes. nothing else in the movie matters after that, it becomes a meaningless string of action sequences, most of which aren't even well choreographed.oh, how about this, a helicopter crashes through the roof of "new alcatraz" at one point, accidentally freeing all of the inmates. and what do they do? they all run out of their cells and play basketball in the middle of the cell block. without so much as a basket. they had a ball, but it doesn't matter. the scene is so stupid they might as well have been playing hopscotch.so some guy is being sentenced to be the first person ever to be executed in alcatraz's state of the art execution chamber, evidently not for stealing $200 million dollars in gold, but for not telling where it was hidden once he was caught.hey, good thinking, people. if you can't get information out of someone, kill them. that's a great way to learn the truth! so some gang breaks into the prison planning to stop the execution and get the location of the $200 million for themselves.oh and the $200 million is in gold bricks. i doubt they thought ahead to how difficult it would be to turn that into exchangeable currency.there's also the issue of the warden at the prison. he's some tough-talking vato who thinks he's a hardcore chollo from the barrio, which reminds me of a joke. i saw this comedian once talking about people in california who talk all tough calling each other ese and homes and all kinds of other such nonsense. these people go to mexico, the comedian says, and they're like, "oh my god! people live there? that's like, a total shack!"the best is when the united states supreme court justice arrives and this guy tells her that her men can't carry their guns inside his prison, "i don't care if she is a united states supreme court justice!"this woman could squish him like a grape and he thinks he's in charge. ha.and by the way, the supreme court justice that gets taken as a hostage in the movie tells the bad guy that she is 53. that's a year younger than steven seagal. i just thought that was funny.the only good scene in the movie is the one in the prison where ja rule is getting slapped around the prison like a sack of cotton balls by this little asian woman. that was the funniest thing i've seen in a movie in a long, long time.you know, i work for the company that produced this film (which i why i watched it), and i still don't have a single positive thing to say about it, except, of course, for that one scene with ja rule getting spanked by that asian woman.so read my review of malena and you will see how strongly i sometimes disagree with professional film critics like roger ebert, but in his review of this movie ebert wrote something that i agreed with as much as anything else he's ever written:"i imagine the flywheels at the mpaa congratulating each other on a good day's work as they rated 'half past dead' pg-13, after giving the anti-gun movie 'bowling for columbine' an r."way to go, guys.

oh dear! what can i say about half past dead? i was really disappointed in it. i was thinking....a steven seagal movie! cool! we'll get to see him kick people and flip people and break bones. we might even get to see him have a stick fight with somebody! excellent!however, i was in for a rude awakening. this film can be summed up as follows:take an episode of the a-team, remove the lovable and roguish characters such as murdoch, hannibal, mr t and face. then get a writer/director to pen a plot even ed wood would be ashamed of and who's too big a fan of the matrix and john woo movies for his own good. throw in a bunch of people with really bad acting ability and who don't have real names. finally, add in a main star who's getting saggy around the midriff and doesn't appear to be able to do his own stunts anymore. the result? half past dead. an action movie so ridiculous that it at least made me smile right the way through. the plot holes are stupendously, glaringly large - for example, prisoners who, when the jail is invaded, fight the invaders rather than attempting to escape. or how about the prison itself, which has an armoury that contains heavy machineguns and rocket-propelled grenade launchers? you also have a helicopter (bearing a striking resemblance to a huey) with some kind of video game machinegun mounted in the nose.then there's seagal himself. i like the guy. he can fight. he's even witty in a way that jean-claude van damme will never be. but all through the movie i kept hoping for that one great, defining fight scene. never happened. instead we got people firing guns a lot and not hitting a whole hell of a lot. i mean, when someone runs down a narrow corridor and you fire a sub-machinegun at them, there isn't a whole lot of places the bullets can go other than down the corridor and into the target. yet somehow they miss? even the a-team would cringe at this foolishness. and then when it gets to any kind of one-on-one physical stuff, we get treated to a shabby matrix rip-off, without the benefit of bullet-time. people getting kicked twenty feet through the air and sundry other ludicrous acrobatic nonsense.c'mon steven, you're better than this. your career can't be over. say it ain't so!this is instantly forgettable (except i'm forcing myself to remember for the purposes of this review) and if you watch it, try to find it amusing in an a-team kind of way. but i doubt it'll be high on anyone's "re-watchable" list. out for justice this ain't. more like out to lunch.

i enjoyed the first "toxic avenger," but the sequel just didn't work. there are some funny gags in the opening, involving members of the home for the blind, but past that point i was simply bored. the sequel is also filled with much quirky, low-brow humor. only this time it's not funny! much of the gags revolve around crusty japanese stereotypes. almost every japanese character seems to be chopping fish. does everyone in japan chop fish? the troma films are known for being more than a little irreverent, but if you're gonna use humor involving racial stereotypes, at least make it funny. i can't laugh if i'm handed the same crap i've seen a million times before! one thing i have to give credit for is the gratuitous nudity. there's even more gratuitous nudity than in the first. but altogether i was very disappointed, and the film ends with a tedious chase scene which had me huffing and puffing, dying for the movie to fade to black. at least there's one hilarious line from the film which had me bawling with laughter. after the villain says a line from shakespeare to one of the local citizens, the citizen (an elderly woman) responds by saying, "f**k you--that's from david mamet."my score: 3 (out of 10)

the toxic avenger, hideously deformed creature of super-human size and strength is back in this sequel that gets mostly everything wrong. toxie goes to japan to find his father at the suggestion of his psychiatrist, whom is in cahoots with an evil corporation who just want the avenger gone to get a stranglehold on tromaville in his absence. with new actors for toxie and his girlfriend, who has a different name in this one, a much less grim, much more comical tone, and a plot line that can't hold a candle to the original. even with the totally uncut version that one can only get if you buy the tox box dvd set, the gore is the only thing going for this one. and if you happen upon any other version forget about getting any enjoyment from this one at all. while the first one is a low budget classic, this simply is not.my grade: d+ eye candy: erika schickel has a very quick nip slip; phoebe legere goes topless; one villianess gets fully nude; and a few extras in a bath house scene show various amounts of skin tox box unrated director's cut dvd extras: intro and commentary by director lloyd kaufman; second commentary with director lloyd kaufman, troma editors gabriel friedman and brian mcnulty; toxie on japenese tv; interview with fangoria managing editor michael gingold; interview by videohound's mike mayo; the same damn radiation march that's on every troma dvd; clip from lisa gaye; "toxie 15 years later" mockumentary; 2 psas; troma intelligence test; troma studio building tour; ad for lloyd kaufman's autobiography; stills gallery; theatrical trailer; and trailers for: "toxic avenger", "toxic avenger 3", "def by temptation", "class of nuke 'em high", "sgt. kabukiman n.y.p.d.", "tromeo and juliet", "bloodsucking freaks", & "surf nazis must die"

the first toxie film was dark, gory, and hillarious. this film is un-gory battles to cheezy jazz music, no real gore at all, and the worst toxie mask i have ever seen! his deep voice is now a light, happy voice, characters from part 1 reappear by actors that look nothing like them (claire, mom junko), characters names change (claire or sara?). it is lacking all the brutal violence, dark humor, and political incorrectness of the first film. if it weren't for nudity, this movie could have been rated pg. really lame. i am a huge fan of part 1 though, just cant stand this one.

gone is the wonderful campiness of the original. in place is a c-grade action no-brainer, wich is not all bad, but pales in comparison to the original. all the meaningless sex and violence is gone, and replaced with crappy jokes and unexplained plot pointers. see it, but don't expect the thrills of the first.

this is the worst of the toxie series by far. the acting in tokyo is horrible and you can understand them about half the time. the major problem with this film is all the sudden changes from the original. like there's a different girl friend of toxie's in this one or it might be the same character just with a different name and played by a different chick. why is this film made like a disney movie. after about fifteen minutes it starts getting good with the gore and all. there's 2 awesome killings then the movie goes straight to poop. after the films 20 minutes are up the film is bearly entertainment. h*ll it's bearly watchable. well unless your drunk then don't watch this film. you've been warned.

the toxic avenger... the idea of this movie is that a person that the common population would call this person a looser and then after being thrown into a barrel of toxic waste, mutated into a superhero that is completely disfigured sounded ok even for 1985. this movie is listed as a horror... i even have read of a cult following with this series.... now this movie even given when it was made was so bad that i couldn't stop watching... the acting is horrible even for an independent film that i think was to be the horror part of this movie...drug dealing, sumo, godzilla entrance.... i'm all for movies that promote anti-drugs... heck i even like godzilla and well sumo... i'm not into it but even still i think that the heights of sumo would love to give this movie the 1000 hand slap and ground salt into the eyes of the people that made this movie... personally i am almost ready to write to the film company that made this and ask them for the 87mins or so of my life back.to me 1 out of 10 is too high it's too bad that there isn't a 0 (zero) or even negative integers to place on a movie here.in other words this movie is j-u-n-k...... would rather watch paint dry and deal with explosive diarrhea then have to watch this movie ever again... i would be the first person that would use not only the packaging of this movie as kindling but i would be up for a good'ol movie and script burning.

the toxic avenger, part ii starts with the startling revelation that after the toxic aveneger (john altamura who was apparently fired during production & replaced with ron fazio) had rid his home town tromaville of evil it actually became a nice place to live. this meant that toxie had no use as a superhero anymore & now suffers from depression & a feeling of utter uselessness (just like directors lloyd kaufman & michael herz should feel like after producing this), toxie now works as a concierge at the 'tromaville centre for the blind'. it's not long before trouble rears it's ugly head though, an evil chemical producing company called apocalypse inc. plans to take over tromaville for some stupid insignificant reason or other but to do so they need to get rid of toxie. after the evil chairman's (rick collins) first plan fails he bribes toxie's psychiatrist (erika schickel) to tell him to go to japan & see his father. leaving his girlfriend claire (phoebe legere), his mother (jessica dublin) & his home behind toxie heads for tokyo, japan. once there toxie sets about finding his father & a woman named masami (mayako katsuragi) helps him in his quest. meanwhile back in tromaville apocalypse inc. move in for the kill & without toxie the citizens are powerless to defend themselves. toxie eventually finds big mac bunko (rikiya yasuoka) whom he has been lead to believe is his father, however big mac is all part of apocalypse inc. plans to destroy toxie once & for all...produced & directed by lloyd kaufman & michael herz this follow up to the successful the toxic avenger (1985) basically proves the first film was a complete fluke, a lucky accident to combine the right blend of bad taste comedy, outrageous violence & so-bad-it's-good film-making, the toxic avenger, part ii is a load of crap in comparison. the script by by kaufman, phil rivio & gay partington terry with a load of 'additional material' credits does not contain one single funny moment during it's entire 102 (uncut director's cut) duration. the visual gags are terrible, toxie walking through tokyo with a wig & glasses to blend in for instance, or a scene where he heats up a bath with a bad guy in it & as he cooks toxie throws in a load of vegetable's & spaghetti, a scene where he sticks electrical wires up a woman's nose, sticks an antenna in her head & a microphone in her mouth to which a japanese radio announcer talks into, a bit where a japanese bad guy has his nose burnt into the shape of a fish, a bit where toxie grabs a swordfish head & uses it as a weapon, or the embarrassingly bad overacting & stupid idiotic facial expressions, a guy who literary has a fish for a head & gets turned literary into sushi, the awful comedy music & sound effects & the whole film in general is a pale imitation of what made the original mildly amusing & memorable. the bad taste gags aren't there this time round & the silly childish juvenile humour of the first is also missing, it just feels like a real step back from the original & lets not forget this is troma here so that is most definitely a bad thing. there are a few gory fights & some serious gore & violence, at least in the supposedly uncut 102 minute version i saw, crushed heads with the bodies spurting out blood, smashed faces, intestines, roses poked in someones eyes & thorns wrapped around their throat, ripped off ears, severed arms & a very graphic & gory scene of a man being chopped to pieces. unfortunately the special effects by pericles lewnes aren't particularly convincing & come mostly within the first twenty or so minutes. the acting is of embarrassing proportions as i've already mentioned. action wise there is an ultra cheap looking car chase at the end & a few unexciting, lacklustre fights utilising cardboard ninja throwing stars at one point. horror wise there is nothing a few gory set pieces apart. comedy wise this is very unfunny. in fact the toxic avenger, part ii sucks on all levels really & to top it all off it's atrociously made as well, most of the cast appear to be people plucked from the nearest street corner, continuity is none existent, cinematography is basic point & shoot & the special effects are anything but. one or two gory scenes apart this is total crap plain & simple, do yourself a favour watch the original again instead.

i knew this was headed for disaster after looking at the clock within 7 minutes of air time. the story line: two people get married. they move into the wife's parents home. and husband doesn't get along with father-in-law-and if you haven't seen this plot before you probably have not watched tv for the last 15 years or so.

this series and elon gold were being hyped as "the next big thing" in sitcoms for nbc. well, they weren't. dennis farina was terribly miscast as the father in-law. he just seemed so uncomfortable and out of place here. the term, "private 'convo' time!" was supposed to become the "dyno-mite!" catch phrase of the 21st century. well, it wasn't. people were asking then, as they still are today (when his name comes up.), "who the hell is elon gold?" i saw him on an episode of "the mentalist" this evening. i mentioned his name, and my girlfriend asked, "who?" not funny. total waste of airtime. nbc had really high hopes for this show, but it just fell flat.

there were nice characters in here, played by pleasant-looking actors and actresses, plus it had a famous band and some famous dancers.....yet the film just didn't work. by the time this was almost over, i was bored to death. the dialog was dumb, the humor (mainly milton berle's) was downright stupid and the music was just not up my alley.i've never been a big-band fan, anyway, and if i hear "in the mood" one more time i'll puke.this was my first look at famous skater-actor sonja henie and i have no complaints about her. almost part of the problem, at least with the humor, is that it's so dated it isn't funny anymore. berle, phil silvers, bob hope, red skeleton, abbot & costello, etc. etc. were hilarious to the crowds in the 40s and 50s but humor changes, and what was funny back then is not today.

what can i say? this was one awful movie to watch. i am normally not very critical of gay cinema in general, due to the fact that most are usually low-budget, but this really pushed me up the wall. i mean, is this was has happened to gay cinema? haven't gay producers and directors learned anything from gus van saints and ang lee's films?. just having to sit through the entire movie was like being in a dentist's chair and having my wisdom teeth extracted. i kept on praying for moments where i would feel any sort of connection with any of the characters, but that never happened. most of the characters performances were just not very convincing. it was like watching one of those badly produced made-for-tv movie specials on a local access tv stations. i cannot tell u how greatly disappointed it was seeing this film after being a big fan of tori spellings other works and the directors last work on "latter day saints." it was definitely not worth the wait. definitely, a few hours of my life i will never get back and will certainly not be purchasing it on dvd.

wow, kiss the bride wasn't that bad, but it wasn't that good either. it sure was no "later day saints." the movie sags in the center...perhaps cutting out about 30 minutes would have made a more enjoyable film. but the film gets bogged down again and again by annoying subplots and throw away scenes - the whole gold outing sequence comes to mind.even though "kiss" was made for theatrical release, it looks and sounds more like a made for tv movie. every scene is lighted like a department store. so many characters are so throw away.and dear tori is actually a pleasant surprise. she steals every scene she appears in.one scene really annoyed me. it was the rehearsal dinner in this larger room with scores of tables - all decorated. but only 5 or 6 people in a room for 250! where did everyone go.gay cinema has sunk to a new low...but not as low as the horrible films being produced and shown on the here! channel.

this is an oft-used line, but it really sums up this movie..."if this is the current state of gay cinema, then we're in real trouble". i saw this film at siff because of the high imdb rating (7.6) and if there was ever a case of vote stacking on imdb, then this is it. just watch the number fall over the release weeks of the film.easy plot...boy finds out his high school ex (boyfriend) is getting married to a female friend of theirs so he goes back to his old hometown (still carrying a 10 year old torch) to see what happened.first off, i liked "latter days", the director's last feature, despite its cookie cutter characters and plot contrivances, but you're supposed to become a better director with each subsequent release. i don't know how you get horrible supporting performances out of so many tv veterans (robert foxworth, joanna cassidy, tori spelling), but somehow he managed to. the writing was lifetime network quality (way back when they were really bad) and the situations were unbelievable and uncomfortably hard to watch. i kept reaching for a non-existent remote control to fast forward, but ultimately made myself stay to the end, hoping for a decent ending. ugh...no. even the gratuitous male nudity that popped up during the movie was so blatantly gratuitous that it seemed to be there to keep people in their seats. to be fair...the 2 leads, especially in the gratuitous nude scenes, were gorgeous. there was also a real sweetness between them during their rekindling friendship as they uncovered how they went separate ways. and the film looked great...good quality and color saturation for an independent film.how is it that network tv can give week after week of great, entertaining weekly episodes (like "ugly betty", "desp. housewives", etc.), but so many feature releases in similar genres can be as bad as this?

as a fan of c.j.'s earlier movie, latter days, i really wanted to like this film.the nicest thing i can say, however, is that it's not an awful film. there are some good performances, and a few funny scenes. in particular, tori spelling has a couple of great scenes where she's talking to her fiancé's ex-boyfriend.overall, though, it's pretty week. the script falls back on weird coincidences and clichéd movie moments way too often. (the main character went to stanford on a golf scholarship, and his high school buddy doesn't even know that he plays the game?) most of the time, this movie had no idea where it was going or what it was trying to say. there are a lot of scenes that are mildly cute, but ultimately turn out to be a waste of time. and you could easily cut half the characters from the film without losing anything.still, for all it's faults, i would have to say that this is one of the better gay films of recent years. which says a lot about how bad most gay films are.i'm hoping c.j.'s next film will be better.

how did so many talented or at least charismatic actors wind up in this baloney? nothing is very good about this movie but the worst things probably are the screenplay and the directing.apparently this is director damian niemans heart-piece as he's both written and directed it (and acted in as well). he's a card magician himself and seems to have named characters in homage of other famous magicians. this was his first feature film as far as i know, and chances are it's his last.it's hard to point to exactly what makes it so poor  but i'd say the story and character's are not believable (the screenplay) and the directing doesn't give it any boost (the director). plus  the poker scenes are bad in the worst hollywood manner (super-hands, hollywood rules)! the supposed twists in the movie are either totally predictable or totally unbelievable. they just end up tying a knot to a story that at best can be described as "a few decent scenes"!

what a cast...and what a waste of it. seriously, when a movie has gabriel byrne, jamie foxx, thandie newton, stuart townsend, hal holbrook, melanie griffith and sylvester stallone in it you would expect some quality. the movie is however one big mess with a unlikely story that can't seem to stop putting twist and turns in it. yeah, i think that they thought they were really being clever with all of it.the story is not only messy and unlikely, it also isn't exactly terribly original. it uses elements from earlier and much better poker game based movies. but to me it were really the many pointless twist and turns in the movie that did it. it made the story such an unlikely one to watch. on top of that the script remains filled with a lot of holes silly poker game errors and things that just don't make an awful lot of sense. why would any one above all things want to play against a card player that is known as the best cheater in the game. this is what the movie is about and builds up to but just didn't ever made a lot of sense to me.despite that the movie has a great cast, it still feels as if most actors were miscast in their roles. i don't know what it is about stuart townsend. he is a good actor but in most roles he plays he always feels out of place. perhaps it are his looks, i don't known. this basically also was the reason why he got replaced in "the lord of the rings: the fellowship of the ring". also thandie newton isn't much good and actually quite annoying in her 'strong' female role. and what was the point of having melanie griffith in this? oh, i guess i could go on about the movie its casting and could complaining even some more about the way too limited screen time the jamie foxx character gets but i guess you get my point by now.damian nieman just isn't much of an original writer/director and on top of that he also doesn't handle his own material very well. scenes often feel disjointed, it tries to put in way too many characters and everything about the movie is shallow and in a way predictable. on top of that the movie features some bad editing at times, which also doesn't help to make this movie look like one seamless whole. the movie was also one major box office bomb and no wonder that damian nieman hasn't made a movie ever since.a too big mess to make you enjoy this movie.4/10

"shade" tries hard to be another "sting", substituting poker for horse racing as the means by which to bring down an enemy, but it fails miserably.i watched the whole thing and still never could quite understand why the young kid wanted to double-cross his partner. was it because his partner stole his girl? is there a woman in the world who is worth going to that much trouble over? if there is, it certainly wasn't this shrew. she had no redeeming qualities whatsoever, and really now, did she actually have a special room set up so that a surgeon could remove the kidney from whoever tried to pick her up in a bar? dina merrill makes a short appearance as a rich woman who hosts, of all things, pay-the-rent poker parties at her palatial home. and then the players say things like, "i'll see your thousand and raise you another five thousand." give me a break. you can't call ("see") and raise, you do one or the other. any kid playing for nickels and dimes at the kitchen table knows this; you'd think grown men playing for stakes this high -- or at least the knuckleheads who wrote the script -- would know it too.one of the other posters mentioned how no high-limit poker game would allow players to actually deal their own cards and i agree. you don't allow two of the best-known car cheats into a game where the buy-in is $250,000 and then let them deal to each other. that's not poker; that's just seeing which one can cheat better. and i'd like to know what person in his right mind would buy in to a game in which two of the best-known card cheats are playing and expect that he might have a chance at winning? and most of all, what mafia boss would run such a game? every time melanie griffith came on the screen i was so mesmerized by those gigantic fluorescent red lips of hers that i completely lost the storyline, and seeing her and stallone together was more like a public service announcement for plastic surgery gone wrong than a love connection. stallone mentions that she used to be a grifter before she bought the restaurant she now runs, but we don't know what kind of grifter she was and we never see her working with stallone in their younger days so we are left to wonder, if we even care that much.jamie foxx is the best character in the whole movie, but he gets killed off right off the bat and we're left with cardboard cut-outs who all sound like they're reading their lines off a teleprompter just off-camera.the ending makes no sense either. the kid gets his cut from the game and just walks down the street with a briefcase full of money and his partner is nowhere to be seen? the mafia isn't watching every move he makes? everyone else just shrugs their shoulders and quietly accepts the loss of millions of dollars without trying to recoup any of it? i don't think so.most of all, this movie does a great injustice to professional poker players all over the world, insinuating that the only way to win is by palming cards and playing with "juiced" decks. and why is it they're always palming kings and aces? sometimes you need a three or a nine to fill a straight or full house.the best parts of the whole film are the sleight-of-hand tricks during the beginning and ending credits; everything in between is ridiculous.

by the time the hellraiser franchise was reaching it's forth film the premise was wearing a bit thin. dr. paul merchant (bruce ramsey) is a scientist in the future, whom while prisoner regales his captor of the story of how his ancestors (all played by ramsey) had first built the evil lament configuration puzzle-box that sets evil upon the world and how his bloodline had subsequent dealing with said box. the film is a awash with lack of continuity in regards to the other films and lack of coherency in this one. yes, this could be due to a combination of rewrites, massive cuts in the original version of the film, or what have you. but i'm reviewing the film as is, and not what it was or could have been. and as it is now it's a mess. sure the franchise will go on indefinitely with direct to dvd sequels, but this one was pretty much a death-nail to it's chances of getting a new one released theatrically ever again.my grade: d-

after the failure of "hellraiser iii: hell on earth," the chapter that served as a kind of 'death blow' to the franchise, another embarrassing cheapo cash-in did not come as a surprise. an abysmal attempt to explain every single mystery of pinhead and the puzzle box, covering literally centuries of history, in a film that runs under 90 minutes... on display is sub-par to wretched acting, sup-par to wretched b-movie special effects, and a ludicrous and insulting attempt at dark humour, while still attempting to keep the whole project completely serious. i'm wondering, how many freaking directors did this thing have? poor pinhead has so much screen time, that every bit of mystery and menace that this iconic character possessed, is completely lost. after an hour of hearing long-winded speeches and dramatic posturing, we simply want to tell the guy to shut up! mildly entertaining in spots, especially in the first segment, this mess begins to look and feel like a cheap, ugly made for tv splatter flick after a while, and ends in the most ridiculous way imaginable: pinhead, along with his pet cenobite dog, killing a bunch of idiots... in outer space! i'm sorry, but any true fan of the first two films in the series, that gave this abortion of a film more than 3 stars, should be ashamed. on a side note, the film that follows; "hellraiser: inferno" is actually a surprisingly intelligent, and stylishly-made film-noir piece, that brilliantly reinstates 'pinhead' as a master of illusion and cruelty, and brings back the concept of the inherent evil in human kind, that was the centerpiece of the original film, and the whole point of the story. for any serious horror fan, see hellraiser i & ii, skip the lousy iii & this one, and continue with 'inferno.' you won't miss a thing by skipping this garbage...

the joe cool review - hellraiser: bloodlinestarring: bruce ramsay as phillip l'merchant/john merchant/dr. paul merchant, valentina vargas as angelique and doug bradley as pinheadplot: this follows a timeline of the lineage of the merchant bloodline, which started with phillip l'merchant, who created the box that opens the doorway to hell. starting with the 18th century to present time when pinhead first meets merchant and tries to sever the bloodline..(he's the only one who can stop pinhead, you see) and finally in the future, in space, where paul merchant has finally figured out how to send pinhead to hell for good.openers: this is a movie hated so much by the people who made it, they declared fictional director alan smithee would be the credited director. they only pull smithee out of the woodwork when they really think they've made a terrible movie, such as classics as the birds ii: land's end or bloodsucking pharaohs in pittsburgh. no i didn't make that up. how did i like it? you're reading this so i'm sure that's what you want to know.the good: this movie isn't as bad as you've been led to believe. oh i'm not going to sugar-coat it. this movie was filled with so much potential and ended up being a disaster, but it does have some positives. cooler cenobites this time around for starters, such as the twins and the demon angelique. pinhead is still in a main role, and still has good lines("pain has a face, allow me to show it to you") and it's somewhat entertaining throughout. gorehounds will love the movie because of it's endless supply. there is also some continuity with the rest of the series, although you'll have to look hard to see it. the chatterer dog is awesome.the bad: but for a story about hell vs the cursed merchant bloodline that could close the gateway forever, it was really complicated and held together with duct tape. nothing was really explored to it's full potential and there were some really stupid things included. pinhead kidnaps a kid and holds him for ransom! random deaths just to feature more blood(not always a bad thing, but not for the sake of the story). pinhead is at his worst here, he rants and rants and rants even when he's about to die! for the very smart demon that he used to be, he's been reduced to nothing more than a bond villain, at best. if hellraiser fans ever needed a reason why he was moved back into a cameo like role, this is it. bloodline ruined it for us all.the ugly: gore is always mentioned here. this one has skin ripping, drilling, hook impaling, beheadings, and more goodies. the chatterer dog, while awesome, reeks of bad special effects during the chase scenes.final verdict: this movie had the potential for something great, even hellbound levels of greatness. but all of that was wasted. who knows exactly what went down to produce this crap, but we can only blame alan smithee.compared to the rest: this movie is the worst of the hellraiser series. for completists only.rating: 1/2* of *****

rarely seen a movie that deviates so much from the original premise and still remains (more or less) acceptablebloodline is a rather short (which is a good thing in this case) escapade that focuses on the mysterious hellraiser box. who wanted it to be made and how it cast a spell on the entire bloodline of the man who eventually created it. we're introduced to 3 generations of the merchant family (all played by bruce ramsey); one in 18th century paris, one in the present day and the last one in a future galaxy far, far away opinions on this storyline may differ a loteither you think it's very idiotic and far-fetched ororiginal and dared. the initial atmosphere and setting by clive barker has completely vanished, yet the morbid surrounding remains and several sequences are still very creepy and unsettling. hellraiser: bloodline contains quite a lot of exquisite slaughtering and the charismatic presence of pinhead (doug bradley) still is an extra horror-value. pinhead  accompanied by a pet puppy this time  still knows how to killtoo bad he talks too much and his vicious speeches tend to get boring quickly. best aspects in this production are the newly introduced `cenobites' and the occult parisian portrait. giant turn-offs are the weak script, the absence of the typical macabre humor and the lack of references to barker's initial masterpiece. although not highly memorable itself, bloodline stands as the last watchable hellraiser film. after this sequel, the series went downhill completely. so far, 2 more sequels came out (2 more are still in process) and neither of those is worth seeing. hellraiser:bloodline suffered from a lot of production difficulties and the director eventually preferred to be credited as alan smitheemeaning he doesn't want to be remembered as the director of it. who could blame him?

never mind the serious logic gaps, never mind the achingly cliche character portrayals, never mind the haphazard writing, and you might like this movie. the main character alyssa was supposed to be endearing, the heroine who you root for to be saved,(or in this case, save herself) but instead she merely grates, and makes one wonder, are all pro ballerinas really that stupid? her busybody mother was obviously only necessary to further propagate the illusion that ballet companies are evil monsters ready to snatch your poor, innocent, young girl from your grasp, with an ever present, biting artistic director/villain. and the cliche's! not only does she become anorexic, bulemic, an over the counter junkie, and a pathological liar, but all in the course of a few months. it's like the writer read every horror story he could dig up about ballet and decided to see how much he could cram into two hours, (with commercials).believe it or not, but i am a dancer. this "uprising" or "resurgence" of anorexia and bulemia that is happening is nonexistent at all of the dance schools i have attended. in fact, the teachers are so scared to even suggest that a girl might stand a better chance a few pounds lighter, most of the dancers in my classes would be actually considered minorly overweight. i'm not saying eating disorders never occur, but not to the extent as it was portrayed in the movie.another annoying problem this movie had was the means-to-an-end writing style. her on again off again boyfriend probably had all of half an hour total screen time, all in the first half. the other supporting characters were merely props, decorations to further the story. given the right dialogue, this would have been a very intricate mind study of a psycological problem. as it is, it turns into a one woman show, and kimberly mccullough doesn't have the chutzpah to pull it off.to a non dancer, this movie would be a supposed "insight" into what really goes one behind closed doors at a ballet company. to a dancer, this is a very insulting movie, which portrays ballerinas as stupid and parents as pushy and ill informed. those adjectives more correctly describe the people who got this on the air in the first place. 3/10

i just purchased this movie because i love to donate to operation smile, the charity on which the movie was based...but i found the writing of the movie to be very strange. it t does not really focus so much on operation smile or similar organizations like the smile train and their herculean efforts to relieve the suffering of children born with facial deformities in third world countries. no, it concentrates on an american teenage volunteer, katie, whose "over-privileged" life in malibu, california, includes a mother who brings her to a doctor so that she'll have birth control pills in her before she sleeps with her boyfriend. what is this birth control nonsense supposed to do, titillate the audience? it's 2005. i'd be more surprised if in 2005 a malibu teen wasn't on birth control, and even if she is, so what and who cares? contrasting katie is the character of lin in china, a girl with a facial deformity who missed last year's chance to get an operation and this year does not want to have one. neither character is written in such a way that the audience can really identify with, let alone understand the motivations of, either girl. on the other hand, the actors do an adequate job of trying to play the bad hand they were dealt by whoever wrote this ridiculous script. the best performance was by the gentleman playing lin's father although much of his dialogue is in chinese and subtitled. operation smile deserved to be honored by a much better movie than this!

not to be confused with michael ritchie's nasty 1975 beauty pageant spoof, this "smile" is a down-turned example of those good intentions paving the road to hell.the film parallels two stories: an impoverished chinese father sacrifices his wife and son to raise a facially-deformed orphan named ling (yi ding), and a tv-spawned malibu family act out "gidget get birth control." katie (mika booram, the third olsen twin) plays a spoiled, self-absorbed high schooler distanced from reality. her teacher (sean astin) paves the way for a school trip to china aimed at showing students how to work with deformed children.the film uses deformity as a means of suspense by treating ling like the frankenstein monster. kramer continually masks her deformity through hats, hoods and camera placement. this approach exploits the freak show quality inherent in the material. she may be uncomfortable with the way society views her and kramer's answer is to cover her up until the big reveal. why disturb your audience with such unpleasantness? we see her face briefly at the end and only minutes before closing-credit snapshots of her after surgery disclose a swan beneath the harelip. it is not good enough to give the girl a reason to live; what is imperative is ling being equally as hot and popular as katie.funding for the film came from a trust established by the late roy rogers and dale evans. they envisioned a heritage of quality family films. give me "son of paleface" any day.

this movie is terrible, it was so difficult to believe that katie became a heartfelt teenager with the power to save the pity chinese people, the movie didn't show any convincing argument to prove that. and the rest of the plot didn't make any effort to show us more than a cheap common sense... the plot is ridiculous and the only thing we can extract from it is that it demonstrate how arrogant a human can be. katie must have inherited her arrogance from her mother, the most annoying character i have seen for a long time. the acting and scenery were ok, but the plot ruins everything, full of cheap clichés and hypocritical scenes, i expect not to see this movie again in my life. skip this one!

take your video camera, turn out all the lights in your house and film people running around with flashlights for an hour and a half and you've got the basic idea of what this film looks like. it is very irritating to watch this kind of movie. to be fair, there are scenes of daylight at the very beginning and very end of the movie. i like scary movies and creature features but this one just didn't do a thing for me. so sorry. i really tried to like it. there didn't seem to be much of a plot other than we've got to find a way out of here. didn't learn too much about any of the characters so it didn't matter if we lost one or two along the way. this isn't the worst movie in the world. "open water" holds that title for now.

what has rajiv rai done to himself? once a hit director of films like tridev and vishwatama is now making one bad film after another. i was initially excited at the thought of rajiv rai returning to the action genre but that soon fizzled out. as a rajiv rai fan i thought i should at least give it a go but i left after an hour. one reason for me leaving the film so early so the amount of paki- bashing in the film, this was not in rai's previous venture.a lot of directors have tried paki- bashing but i did not expect it from rajiv rai another letdown was the music. rajiv rai's have always had good music until now. there is only one good song and that is tere dekh dekh ladgayan. the performances are not upto scratch, not even from rai loyalist naseer-uddin- shah. avoidable fare from once my favourite director.

watched this film with an audience of....5 in total! had a choice between lakshya and asambhav...(realized then i should have gone for lakshya). a typical plot...india v pakistan..but just isn't cricket as you have kashmir in the middle. an indian super hero goes on a mission to save the president of india from some pakistani rebels who are involved in a mass drug smuggling racket. i left the film half way as it was simply boring and the plot was confusing and all over the place. the songs were also awful, the film tries to hide the flaws with its special effects but unfortunately they are outdated too.overall...avoid it if you can, has to be the worst film i've seen this year.

a pretentious but - to varying degrees - watchable collection of mostly pointless "stories".but let's start from the top.kaurismaki: if one ever wondered what finnish love/romance was like, perhaps this dull little oddity is some indication. subdued feelings, non-emotions, apathetic faces and a very depressing prospect of moving from finland to siberia! i guess the sequel to this story will be "for our honeymoon we move from siberia to greenland". aki obviously had no clue what to write for this little movie, so he just made up some half-assed non-"story" centering around a band he particularly likes (or maybe they're his friends) because we get to watch them and listen to their music more than the two principal characters.erice: first off, i've never heard of this guy before  and now i know why. nice black&white photography and pretty much nothing else - unless being bored silly can be considered an asset. but you'd be surprised how many movie-critics and film students love boredom in movies so i hotly recommend erice's 10-minute snooze-fest to those two groups of humanoids.herzog: not a movie but probably a slice out of his documentaries about tribes in south america. this isn't a short film but a report, but considering how dull the first two entries were, herzog's bit is almost refreshing and does have some interesting moments, and if nothing else fits into the movie's pretentious "time" concept very neatly.jarmusch: as was to be almost expected, this once-interesting film-maker (with the brain of a peanut; a talented idiot savant) serves us yet another doze of pointlessness. he has become lazy and can't be bothered to write anything interesting, either for his own movies or a collection such as tmo. the only bright side in watching how a dumb veggie actress spends 10 minutes in a trailer is that she is played by the lovely chloe sevigny. otherwise, skip this nonsense. oh, and btw: i don't believe that any young actress listens to classical music; was jarmusch trying to be surreal by making chloe listen to that kind of music? does lindsey lohan perhaps listen to opera? maybe drew barrymore is a jazz fan? who am i to say they aren't?!jim jarmusch is a moron. oh, right... i already mentioned that...wenders: here is the actual shock of the whole movie: wenders can actually make something good!!!!!? everything else i've seen from this overrated charlatan has so far been dull and pointless. however, this short little story is done with style(!  atypical) and is the best part of the movie. it leaves one wanting to see more of it, even though the story has a resolution.spike lee: oh, dear lord what can i say here? lee makes anyone seem talented by comparison. like herzog, he chooses not a story but submits a report  and a left-wing political propaganda report at that! cnn, but in black and white, and one-sided, of course. naturally, "we wuz robbed", the retarded title of this little sleep-inducer, is about how the poor, gullible and infinitely idealistic democrats wuz robbed by bush and his evil evil team of thieves. this is by far the dumbest and dullest entry in this movie, and i had to utilize the fast-forward button so as not to doze off. spike lee truly is a product of affirmative action. god knows how many really talented (black) directors never had a chance to make movies because this pretentious and talentless little runt keeps getting opportunity after opportunity to make them. and he gets it wrong every time! now that does take some kind of talent, right? kaige: the chinese story has a solid premise. it's okay, nothing more.all in all, there are many and far better movies to spend your time on, but if your time isn't that valuable (as is apparently the case with my own) you can check this little film out."ten minutes sure can be an eternity in the hands of anti-masters of cinema. time is precious. waste it on better movies." - fedor miklowitz, 1588

i have been reading comments on imdb for some time now. an 8.3 average for this movie just plain gets on my nerves. i don't mean to pull one of those "i just signed up for an account so i can post on this movie" bits..... but, i just did. the only theme you will come away with from this movie is that incest does not deserve to be ridiculed.now, i realize many 'hoity-toity' film people love this movie; nevertheless, it is crap. the thing that really gets to me is the fact that the director expects you to have sympathy for the 'villain' in the movie. if you do have sexual relations with your sister, you should probably be an outcast from society. just my personal feelings i guess. yet, i sat through 2 hours of this *expletive* expecting some really deep reasoning behind dae-soo's imprisonment.i tend to like a lot of foreign movies, but this is my first encounter with a korean flick and it has put them last in line in my book. oh... i feel better already after a little venting.

let me get this out of the way before i trash this film: i love park chan-wook's work as a director. while i disagree with the masses saying he's is the best director working in our time, i can't deny that he understands how to use a camera very effectively. i really liked one of his other films, sympathy for mr. vengeance. also, min-sik choi's acting was the only thing that allowed me to take this film seriously . . . for 1/5 of the runtime, that is.now the bad: the plot is simply the oldest cliché used in cinema/literature. i'll never understand how critics can trash a hollywood blockbuster for being cliché, then hail movies like oldboy which are just as unoriginal and clichéd if not even more so. regardless, oldboy is flat-out one of the most generic, unoriginal movies ever conceived. *spoilers* man is held captive, man seeks revenge, man finds out he had sex with a family member, man's life is over. *end spoilers* simply put, this plot line has been used in everything from greek plays to modern melodramatic soap operas and countless movies/books in between. it is so melodramatic and unoriginal when the major reveal happens, i laughed out loud. does that mean i'm a desensitized freak without emotions as some reviews of this film say about people like me? no. what it means overdone plots make people laugh. the scary movie franchise proved that, and oldboy proved it as well. why can't people think of something that is truly disturbing instead of just spewing out tried clichés masked with fancy camera-work and classical music? that brings up the issue of blood/gore. simply put, it isn't there. the director is too timid to even point the camera at the screen when something "gory" happens, as if we're watching a children's movie or something. maybe we were. anyway, i've heard oldboy called the "most brutal movie of all time" and "the most disturbing movie ever" but when i watched it i failed to see anything even remotely gory or disturbing. all the "gore" is off-screen, and even then the violence level is nothing you haven't seen in pg-13 movies like the dark knight or casino royale before. why this even got an r-rating confuses me, much less "the most brutal movie of all time". seriously, i've seen movies that just make oldboy look cute on every level when it comes to violence/gore.the other huge glaring, cheesy flaw is the main villain. the majority of his screen time he's showing his bare butt off for the audience in comedic american pie-style, but i'm supposed to think he's oh-so-evil? when he's wearing clothes, his hair is slicked back like a bad asian mix of the cheesiest james bond villain mixed with something out of austin powers. he talks like a brain-dead teenager recovering from an acid overdose, and his dialogue is so bad it had me laughing yet again. seriously, oldboy had me laughing more than any comedy this year . . .in the end, oldboy is for those of you who sip fine wine, have no sense of humor, and talk about how boring your lives are at dinner parties. it's for those people who are so stuck up in their own ego they forgot how unoriginal they are, and consequently forgot how unoriginal and boring the "films" (never "movies") they enjoy are.to those people all i can say is this: i like "films" and also like "movies". i like thoughtful dramas that actually say something about the human condition, and i also like pointless action movies that thrill me into a coma. but the thing is, for me to like both "films" and "movies", they have to be original. they have to be something i haven't seen so many times i lost count of the number of times the plot has been used. when something isn't original, it's expendable. if it does exactly what everyone else does, it's forgettable and boring. before you give oldboy yet another perfect rating because it "touched" you, maybe you should think about something: wouldn't a movie equally as touching, but at the same time original make you think more? i just wish someone other than me would understand this.overall: oldboy is forgettable and cheesy.1/10

... so some people might argue that this can't possible be the worst movie ever made, and no it's not. i have seen movies with weaker plots, worse acting and so on.so why do i hate this movie über alles? well, it's basically about a man, who gets kidnapped for many years, and when he comes out, he tries to find out who did it and why, to get revenge. the problem i have with this movie has nothing to do with gore or horror, but***major spoilers stop reading if you don't want to know*** our main character basically gets tricked into having sex with his own daughter, and he wants to cut out his own tongue so his enemy won't tell her, because she didn't know. it is so humiliating as he crawls on his knees like a dog in total submission. and why did he deserve this? because many years ago, he saw a brother and a sister have a tender moment - in the wrong way. he went on and told some people, and as a result she commits suicide. and viola, it's the brother who put our main character through all this just for that. i have wondered: maybe i hate this movie so much because i think his punishment is way too harsh. maybe because i feel this movie doesn't condemn incest, but somehow confuses it with love. maybe it's because i expected something else.***end of spoilers***believe me, nobody deserves what happens to our main character in the end, and i'm very serious; you know how some movies just go under your skin and stay there? well, i felt goddamn dirty after watching this movie, and i really wish i'd never seen it. it stayed with me for days, and some might ask: well, isn't that the purpose of a good movie? the ability to affect us in such ways? yes, it can be, but this movie not only made me sick, it made me feel violated.

when one of my friends recommended this to me, raving about how well it was filmed, the underlying themes and the general greatness of the film, i obviously expected an amazing, at least entertaining film.the two hours i spent watching this turned out to be a huge disappointing waste of my time.i understand that this movie is meant to be surreal, but even in surreal movies, there is something which anchors it down, even if it is only in the slightest. this movie, on the other hand, felt forced and fake. a lot of the shots were unnecessary and watching it made me think the director was trying to hard to be artistic.the acting was poor, and the relationships between characters were not nearly developed enough. maybe that's just me missing something that others could see but i hadn't even realised there was any sort of attraction between dae su and migo before they started getting at it like rabbits randomly half way through the film. then again, maybe this film was just bad.i am not against violence in movies, but in this one, almost all of it was just unnecessary. throughout all the fight scenes i felt myself cringing at how painfully cliché it all was.and the plot? the word laughable comes to mind. i would be amused if i hadn't wasted two hours of my life following this poorly thought out and ridiculous plot. despite all the movie's flaws, by the end of it, i was expecting something interesting to conclude it. i won't discuss the ending, because i wouldn't want to "spoil" the movie for those who haven't seen it. just that the metaphor "be it a rock or a grain of sand, in water they sink as the same." cannot be used as an explanation for everything.this entire movie was made for shock value and shock value only. i just hope sooner or later people will stop being so pretentious and recognise a bad movie for what it is. i've seen many other great korean films and it depresses me that people have hailed oldboy as the best.

*****classic ****excellent ***good **fair *tragicreview:oldboy is not for everyone. it's pervasive violence, its live octopus eating and it's unimaginary story.the film focuses around a man who's been kidnapped and is imprisoned for 15 years, oh dae-su is released, only to find that he must find his captor in 5 days. now the story though may seem gripping to start with but once watching this bloated and un-original blood fest it develops into a mash of bitter blood and a forceful film.it's directing is on par of average and by no means the standards of what a south korean thriller should be. oldboys acting scenes are paralleled with dull humour and a poorly writtern script.oldboy is occasionlly presented with thin straw performances that one could only feel shameful about.verdict:not for everyone but it's scope and vision isn't clear enough to see further than the grey abyss of fog.*tragic

there's a thin line between being theatrical and being just plain forced. forced acting. forced takes. forced plot. even forced photography. there's people who say "the movie develops that way because it's from asia" but i don't see any kind of forced elements on seven samurai or sonatine. there's a thin line between being fiction (and every work of art it is, in it's way, fiction) and being just unlikely.in a more personal way, i just don't feel anything with the movie, it doesn't take me anywhere, and i just can't believe in the fictional world it is proposed. it just doesn't feel right, there's something in it or through that just doesn't click.

oldboy is set in korea & starts as a drunken dae-su oh (min-sik choi) is bailed out of the police station by his friend only to be abducted, dae-su wakes up & finds himself in a small room which he will be imprisoned in for the next fifteen years. dae-su is fed & looked after by his unknown captors but is never allowed out of the room, dae-su begins to train himself to avenge himself after he gets out which he intends to do by scrapping away the cement from the brickwork with a chopstick. however before dae-su finishes he is gassed & rendered unconscious, when he wakes up dae-su finds himself free on the roof of a tall building dressed & all moneyed up. dae-su instantly sets about trying to find out who imprisoned him, after meeting the pretty mido (hye-jeong kang) the two fall in love & together with her help dae-su finally finds what he is looking for but the truth comes at a price...this south korean production was co-written & directed by chan-wook park & has gotten any number of glowing reviews (the sort that distributors can pick quotes out & plaster them on the video box) & even won the grand prize of the jury at cannes while it was also nominated for the golden palm so surely oldboy is a true classic? well not for me it isn't since as i can't understand why it's so liked & i would go as far as to say i pretty much hated it apart from one or two isolated moments. for a start i couldn't get into the story at all, i just didn't like it as i thought it was slow & boring & while many out there would have you believe oldboy has the bestest most shocking twist ever i thought it was rather plain & not very well executed either. the ending in which dae-su goes to the new zealand alps to be hypnotised feels tagged on as well almost as if the makers wanted some sort of happy ending. at almost two hours i almost fell asleep i was so bored, the violence is tame & it's the thought of what's happening that i would imagine most people have a problem with rather than what is actually shown. in fact oldboy has a very low body count of about seven & one mild sex scene, it's really not that graphic or memorable. i didn't warm to any of the character's & while i accept oldboy has an alright concept & premise it fails to deliver & it's one film that i will never understand why so many people seem to like.based on a japanese manga of the same name oldboy the film looks alright, there's one or two nice visual moments here although while everyone raves about the hallway fight that takes place in one continuous shot i was pretty unimpressed & thought the fight choreography was quite dull. the actual on-screen gore violence amounts to very little, dae-su eats a live octopus which is apparently quite normal in korea anyway, there are some fight scenes, a severed hand, someones teeth are pulled out & there's a bit of blood at the end.the budget was supposedly around the $4,000,000 mark which is actually a fair bit, filmed in south korea & new zealand. the acting looks alright but it's hard to tell when actors are speaking a different language.oldboy is a film that i found an absolute chore to sit through, i don't mind subtitled films or foreign films or paying attention to the plot as i followed the thing perfectly but i just didn't like any of it & it's as simple & straightforward as that. apparently the second in director choi-wook park's revenge trilogy which also includes sympathy for mr. vengeance (2002) & lady vengeance (2005).

this movie was one of the longest movie watching experiences of my life. while i like how the director, chan-wook park, handled the revenge, the move as a whole was terrible. oldboy is only billed at 1 hour and 55 minutes long but it feels like it takes at least 3 and a half hours to tell this story. i will say that the english dubbing was done very well and the movie was easily understandable. i felt that some of the scenes were unnecessarily long and a lot of the dialogue repeated itself. also, if you have an aversion to annoying voices, then avoid hearing hye-jeong kang (she plays mi-do) speak. if you are looking for a movie to kill time and make you feel morally superior to others, then watch away. if you don't want to watch a movie filled with incest, bad dialogue, unnecessary fight scenes, gross torture scenes and confusing flashbacks, then this is not the movie for you.

please do not blame korea for this bad movie. i am in korea (please excuse bad english). it sadden me to see these movies which make korea look like obsessed with blood and sex. it sadden me even more to see animal killings and hear americans say that is how korea is. we do not eat live animals!! so please stop excusing movie for its crime by saying it is the culture! there is scenes with the man eating live animals and non koreans think it is normal. no it is disgusting to us too. the director is a misfit, sick individual who has obsession with killing and sex with family members. i wish america and france will stop glorifying this bad man who is laughable in his own country. please watch any other movie from korea, that will give you ideas of how artistic we really are. this movie is rubbish.

unbelievable. "philosophy". "depth". "genius". "masterpiece". people must have seen another "oldboy" because the one i've seen was a badly written, poorly conceived, over-the-top-acted, sordid piece of "kraapola" which, even ignoring for a moment the ludicrously violent scenes which makes it unsuitable for the eyes of a child, could barely satisfy the imagination and the thirst for plot consistency of a seven years old.the "depth" of this sorry concoction was exhausted in one little piece of wisdom, "laugh and the whole world will laugh with you, weep and you'll find yourself alone", the type of boring fortune cookie saying which a great author, be him shakespeare or, more to the point of imdb, kurosawa, would have thrown in the garbage can with no second thoughts. where this movie should have landed too, if we wouldn't live in an era in which the cheaply shocking and the perversely disgusting are confused with what used to be named once "great art". in short, yuck.2 out of 100. it's not 1 out of 1000 only because of some occasionally expert camera-work. in no way enough to save this infantile failure from worthlessness, though.

it seems that some viewers assume that the only thing which can make the viewer dislike this movie is the graphic violence. in fact violence, both disturbing and cartoonish, is the last of "oldboy"'s deep flaws. the characters are unidimensional, underdeveloped, primitive. the "intensity", an obsession and a goal in itself with this director, is served up with the cheapest of means. let's not confuse a mindless shot of adrenaline with artistic worth. by the end of the movie, it seems that all the cards were exhausted so the script becomes almost inadvertently funny in its efforts to find new levels of "horror", to continue to "shock" an audience which is already numbed by the plethora of dumb soap-opera "revelations" already served up in big bunches. it would be hard to imagine anybody even vaguely familiar with the masterpieces of the last fifty years of asian cinema being enthralled by this pompous piece of trash. imagine homer simpson hesitating in front of the cinema theater: "should i go in or should i buy five cones of ice-cream for the same money?" be smart, homer, go for the ice-cream.

i am sorry to rain on everybody's parade. just a little background about me: i like and know a lot about asian cinema, especially japanese, chinese and indian. admittedly i am a novice when it comes to south-korean cinema but, if this is the best of the best, sorry. i just want you to know that i am not at all narrow-minded when it comes to appreciating foreign movies and i do not fit the stereotype of the "dumb american" . . . well, not perfectly.i cannot believe the high praise this piece of nothing is bestowed upon. this is a disgusting *and* ludicrous movie. hammy acting - everything is badly done and overdone, like begging for the uneducated viewer's attention. horrible camera-work, with an insistence on meaningless close-ups derived from the mtv aesthetics.the plot is more full of holes than a gigantic piece of swiss cheese. nobody expects a thriller to be 100% realistic, and for the sake of entertainment i'd be happy to close my eyes to small unfitting details. but, excuse me, what's happening here that *can* stand even summary scrutiny? this story of an unbelievably intricate and contrite act of revenge is worse than the worst tabloid story one can read in a line at the supermarket. (don't want to spoil your "enjoyment", if that's the word, so won't go into details of the plot.) the fighting scenes are violent, unbelievable, downright stupid (the main "hero" taking on dozens and dozens of opponents in the same time, after he only trained while imprisoned, punching a wall ! ) the truly "outstanding" features of this movie are two: the lurid and incestuous sex (brother on sister and father on daughter, well, we've evolved since oedipus, didn't we?) and the graphic violence. the cut off body parts - hands, teeth, tongues - together with industrial quantities of spilled blood (how many tens of thousands of tomatoes had to die for this movie to be made?) have no esthetical function/motivation whatsoever.a feast for the s & m inclined, admittedly, but, even for those, a feast of no merit nor subtlety. heavens, even mel gibson's recent and much-discussed work on an almost similar theme wasn't that bad.the invariably good press this pretentious, overblown, overlong piece of gratuitous gore coming from korean shores obtains makes me wonder what's happening. i don't think of myself as being the ultimate paragon of taste and often i am ready to accept that a movie i didn't enjoy may be better than i was able to perceive. however, i have no scruples whatsoever in calling this one as i see it: bad, bad, bad. no redeeming qualities. my 2c? find something better to do with your time.

this comment is meant mainly as a warning to the people who might be attracted to the title by its (temporarily)high user rating which i find frankly puzzling. the reasons why i didn't like this title are following:1. the directer must have had some doubts whether to make a jackie-chan-type of a flick or a dark oedipian tragedy. as a result, in terms of genre, the film falls between two stools, as the tragic and comic elements clash and cancel out each other rather than make a harmonious whole.2. the characters' motives and behaviors are incoherent and unconvincing. psychological truth and logic are sadly missing.3. absurd casting. i don't blame the actors, for it is a hard thing to create a convincing character by acting alone, if there is scarce logic in the script. however, why is there an apparent age difference of about 15 years between the leading two actors, whose ages in the film can't differ by more than 3-4?4. to me the film was poor entertainment primarily because of point 2. if you can't find a character you could sympathize with it is hard to follow the story with interest. when you finally learn the reason of what happened to the main protagonist, it turns out to make no sense.5. some films apart from being entertaining are also thought-provoking. having seen this film, i began to wonder whether the thought the director tried to provoke was not that incestuous relationships could be perfectly wholesome and delightful. i cannot put any other construction on the ending. 6. the film is rife with totally unnecessary violence. violence in a film (and elsewhere) is a good thing, if it serves an important and worthy purpose. purposes can be different and i don't want to enter into this broad subject. let me just say i don't object to violence in such films as "saving private ryan", "the passion of the christ" or "the pulp fiction". in "oldboy" the scenes of torture and suffering are prolonged and graphic (or aural). what for? i do not know. personally, i don't derive any satisfaction from watching teeth being extracted with a hammer or hear a man cut off his tongue with scissors and then see him choking on his own blood etc. etc. 7. the film reminds me a little of japanese porno mangas in its fixation on incest and young asian girls' panties, urinating and the like. it appears there is a minority who actually enjoy this kind of thing. if you're one of them, you might find this film enjoyable.in short, i do not recommend this film either as entertainment or "food for thought". where it isn't silly, it is disgusting. don't waste your time.

this movie was awful, plain and simple. it will probably be revered by those who only see "films" and not "movies" and will therefore feel sorry for me for having such a limited understanding of the theatrical brilliance of this film, but i am secure enough in my intellect to say that this boring, self-aggrandizing and painfully drawn-out movie was a waste of two hours and nine dollars.i was suckered into seeing this by the inexplicable good reviews it had been receiving and came out of the theater thinking that those reviews had to have been written by over-excited film students and the aforementioned group of individuals who shun regular movies, perhaps for fear that they may actually enjoy one someday.the storyline is quite a promising one - a man is imprisoned for 15 years, never knowing his captor nor his crime. he is then abruptly released and given just five days to discover the identity and reason of the man who imprisoned him. however, the great concept soon disintegrates into a pathetic joke as oh dae-su runs around beating people up, trying to have sex with a young girl who is attempting to use the toilet and eating a live, writhing squid (presumably for dramatic effect, as there is absolutely no other reason for it). all the while he is trying to figure out this horrible thing he did to earn himself fifteen years in jail, and when he finally finds out it is both ridiculous and a major letdown. his nemesis, a man who supposedly went to school with him when he was a young man, looks like a banana republic model twenty years younger than him. hey, i know prison has been hard on oh dae-su, but is it too much to ask to find an actor that looks a bit closer to his age? of all the things wrong with this movie, this one seems like the easiest one to fix.and the big secret - the one that kept me in my seat for 90 minutes when i could have been out doing something productive - is some joke of a plot line involving incest and a rumor started in high school. come on! throw us a bone here - was that really the best they could do? i sat through stupid dialogue, over-acting, gloomy sets and gratuitous violence for this? (by the way - i'm not at all against violence in a film if it seems to fit the story, but in this case it seems i was forced to watch our hero knock out someone's front teeth and cut off his own tongue with a pair of scissors in order to distract me from figuring out i was wasting my afternoon watching a pretentious piece of garbage).take my advice - do something else with your time and money. or take your nine dollars and go see a lowly "movie" - one that you might actually enjoy.

by jove, what an unholy mess! revenge, incestuous love, mechanical games-like fighting, ceaseless and utterly unnecessary violence, some primitive "music" hammering away at the bewildered victims, big "surprises" (which actually tend to be about as "revelatory" as the national enquirer's headlines). add some shoddy camera movements pretending to be stylish and creative and you've already impressed the crowds. this movie's totally undeserved popularity powerfully indicates the very low level pop sub-culture has succeeded not only in achieving in the last decades, but also in imposing as dominant taste on an impotent audience. (for by far deeper insights into human sufferance under mental sickness, without "oldboy"s vulgar excesses, i recommend an older dutch/french movie, "the vanishing".) well, don't believe there's absolutely nothing good to say about this movie. in fact there is. the (in)famous scene in which the hero (is really a "hero", an abject father who sleeps with his daughter and then attempts to obtain forgetfulness rather than redemption?) eats a live octopus benefits greatly from the vivid presence of the best actor in the entire cast: the octopus itself. too bad the poor beast, having been eaten, couldn't survive its one and only act in order to obtain yet another worthless diploma, for the "best actor", at the cannes festival. which festival, by the way, between moore's propaganda nonsense and this epitome of worthless if somewhat exotic weirdness, became a festival of the vapid and of the ludicrous.sic transit gloria mundi!

this sequel to the above - and the final entry in the "kharis" series - is slightly more enjoyable on the whole but it's also more contrived (hell, we even get a singing barmaid/hostess!): peter coe is easily the least charismatic of the various egyptian high priests we've seen during the course of these films, and martin kosleck as his henchman seems uninterested in the proceedings; kurt katch, then, is saddled with a ridiculous accent as the man who discovers the newly reincarnated princess ananka: the latter, in the form of virginia christine (later a much-used character actress) gets her most substantial 'role' and, indeed, the sequence of her resurrection from the swamps is a highlight not only of this film but the entire series. unfortunately, here too, chaney has precious little to do as once again the emphasis is on ananka, as i've said; his mummy (to which he returned most often at universal - apart, naturally, from his signature role of the wolf man!) remains, without a doubt, his least memorable monster for the studio.

this film laboured along with some of the most predictable story lines and shallow characters ever seen. the writer obviously bought the playbook "how to write a space disaster movie" and followed it play by play. in particular, the stereo-typical use of astronauts talking to their loved ones from outer space - putting on a brave show in the face of disaster - has been done time and time again.max q appears to have been written in the hope that the producers would throw $50 million at the project. but, judging by the latter half of the film which contained numerous lame attempts at special effects, the producers could only muster $50 thousand. to learn that the film was nominated for a "special visual effects" emmy has me absolutely gob-smacked.i think a handful of high school students with a pass in media studies could have created more believable effects!and the plot holes are too numerous to mention. but i will pick one out as an example. now, i'm no nasa expert, but surely it's highly implausible that a worker attached to the shuttle simulator would suddenly hold a position of power in the control room when things start to go pear-shaped with the program. surely there is someone more experienced at mission control who the program director would call on rather than a twenty-nine year old who has not been in the control room before.the only saving grace for this film is the work of bill campbell. he manages to make a good attempt at salvaging something out of the train wreck that is this script.i give this film 2 out of 10, with the above-average work of bill campbell in the lead role saving it from a lower mark.

i'm sorry, but this really does feel like a modern day apollo 13 knock-off. totally implausible (at least armageddon felt like a comic book! this felt like a bad high school film project), acting was about as cliché as one can get, and....landing a space shuttle on an la freeway? come on. seriously. jerry, what were you thinking? and all the clichés: the pregnant astronaut's wife, the nosy reporter who gets in everyone's way, the stalwart manager with "go fever". and it's one thing to twist the laws of physics or politics or whatever to make an entertaining story, but at least make it good! fact and science were totally butchered for this. the space shuttle doesn't have fuel tanks in it's wings, and even if it did, it couldn't steer by shifting fuel between them (and neither could a dc-10).if you like bad acting, bad storytelling, low realism, and cheesy clichés, this one can't be beat!

hmmm, not a patch on the original from shaw brothers. the fighting is average and looks very clunky. the story line is as to be expected from a 70's kung fu film, confusing and daft. stupid voices for women,dubbed in posh english accents for men. i turned this off early and i love martial arts flicks. get the original, its so much better than this average movie, don't be fooled, i bought the wrong flick what i wanted was the shaw brothers movie. i have just started commenting, i'm only doing foreign and martial arts films this is just the beginning of my movie collection, i personally own most modern martial arts flicks. hope you don't waste time watching this one, its for die hard fans of 70's kung fu only.

ok, this movie wasn't good at all. video games aren't what i would brag on if i was over the age of 15. cool to play games, but writing a comment about video game players may like this movie for that it is, that is strange. just play a video game, don't make up a sorry story about getting trapped in one. i use my cell phone, i hope i don't loose my girlfriend in that. grease being the worst ever? ok, grease has a very well thought out story along with being a musical. even if you don't like musicals, anyone would say grease is good. my brother plays video games all the time and he watched 30 minutes and left because it was so awful. i feel asleep.

well, the first thing i saw after looking at the dvd box was "best screenplay" and thought this would be a good rental. wow, was i mistaken! i'm sure at one time there was a good movie in here, but after the incredibly poor acting and "video game" production values, this ends up looking like tron's retarded half-brother. the first scene sets up the overall atmosphere of the entire movie. five minutes into it, you'll be asking yourself, "what the hell am i watching?", and it will just snowball from there. an awful soundtrack that makes every song sound like rob zombie's "dragula" rounds out this miserable piece of crap into a laughably bad movie. on a side note, #3 most romantic quote in a movie - "i think you're the final destination."

first there are some plot holes in this movie. we see in the very beginning a kid dies from playing the game. but who was tied up in the mail truck delivering the package which contains the game? how did the driver place the package into the mailbox when he was lashed to the steering wheel? it is not like he was mr. fantastic. wow that in just the first 15 minutes... the actors are second rate, take the "bad guy" played by patrick kilpatrick (who?) exactly he has appeared in one episode of everything on tv and some secondary roles in poor movies (like this one). so most of the acting is like tv dramas, i can live with that, but the graphics or special effects are horrible. the disembodied "game" voice sounds like a poor clone of hal from "space oddessy 2000". what they called zombies looked more like shadows jumping around like monkeys from "planet of the apes". the aliens had transparent bodies like the shadow zombies. in most cases, the movie was just predictable as it had no hook or hidden agenda going. the story was a good idea but like most good ideas discussed over lunch was never developed beyond that good idea stage.

i've never written a comment on imdb before, but this movie was so bad it left me little choice but to warn you not to waste the two hours of your life. as an avid wwii historian, i don't even know where to begin on how historically inaccurate this movie was. carbines with korean war bayonet lugs, k98k's missing cleaning rodes and sight hoods, german uniforms that didn't exist, the list could go on forever. added that it's loaded with flaws, has literally no plot or climax, and acting on par with your local high school theater. the epitome of cheesy. please...there are too many good wwii movies out there to waste your time on this junk.

i've rent the movie because i'm very fond on war movies and on the cover picture i've read " better than save private ryan"....mmmmm ...i thought cool! guys....is just a ridiculous movie. almost fun. nothing to do with a proper war movie. i want my money back! why the f...k the peoples lies??????????? f no subtitles they tried to make everything cooler with the light....but they didn't make it. sorry about this.....but the movie is awful. the italians are shown as "mafia e mandolino"the american as stupid farmer the germans as even more stupid farmer.the actor are ridiculous and unprofessional.please....please......

what on earth was that? my family and i just waisted 2 hours of our life for this piece of rubbish !!! there was no plot, no tension, only a lot of boredom !!! my kids could do better movies with our video-camera.but maybe we just did not get the point of the movie...oh wait, my mum did. she was the only one who liked it for the following reason: "at least a film with no cars screeching..." if you are looking for a war-film with no fighting in it, is still interesting and gripping and has a strong anti-war-message, then you should watch "the trench".i give this film 3 out of 10 because it is good enough for an afternoon-nap and because i am too nice...

for starters, i once met the director when he was going to ww2 re-enactments with a period movie camera and making videos of the events which looked darned good. i really wish he'd kept that up. because as much as i applaud what he accomplished on a clearly "next to nothing" budget, when i popped out the dvd, i just wondered why i sat through almost two hours of nothing. there's no real plot to speak of, you don't really care what happens to the characters (maybe the italian troops and some of the germans), and the ending is yet another "art film" commentary on the futility of war. i could have told someone how it would end once i got through the first ten minutes. i knew the germans would have a few heroically volunteer to fight to the death, i knew most of the quartmaster gis would be killed, it was just too darned obvious! and while i'm on the subject, i was shocked to see so much of the axis side done well, yet the gi side done comically. all the character development was clearly for non-english-speaking roles. the gis simply got shafted hard in this film. and i can't help but wonder if they even had someone on the set who understood how the us army works? the phrases, terminology, actions, were clearly written by someone with no knowledge of the american military at all. had i now known who had directed this film, i'd have sworn it was directed and written by a german...

remember those terrible war movies your grandmother forced you to watch 25 or so years ago on your old vhs recorder? "the fallen" is just a bad executed remake of those movies! the story is terrible, the direction is terrible, the editing is terrible, the music is terrible, and all together make an unbearable nightmare.it is also terribly slow! very slow! i tried to sleep while watching it but i couldn't do it because i had nightmares of it.please don't watch this movie! it is that bad! ten lines is a lot so i don't know what else to say.press the eject button now and you wont regret it!

a moderately interesting start, some pretty scenes in sixteenth-century japan, and a promising idea. but the execution? the comparison that springs to mind after about fifteen minutes is "cannibal women in the avocado jungle of death." really. a specialist in "oriental history" who doesn't speak any japanese, walks on tatami without removing her shoes, and is generally dumb as celery? please. this looks like a student film: the sets are risible, the acting (except, perhaps, for the title character) close to wooden, the plot utterly arbitrary. at least "cannibal women" was funny! this is best watched with someone who knows something about japan, just to watch disbelief repeatedly crawl across their face.

oh how awfully this movie is! i don't know if it is a horror film or a drama, cause the story and the both genres are not established very well! the story is not moving, it is slow, boring, and sleepy from the beginning to end. this movie really bores me! but i really liked the camera work, it is authentic, fresh and clear, the acting is great too, the little boy was the great performer in this movie, but it hasn't made me to jump from my seat. but this movie makes me grab a pillow, lay on the bed and sleep until the credits roll...boring! not worth watching! i tell you, this movie sucked!1/10

i'm a fan of the horror movie, regardless of which hemisphere it comes from. i know what to expect from the west, the east and most horrors in the middle. so i received the dvd of 'acacia' in the post and looked forward to a slow build of ever increasing tension and scary children with odd, disjointed movements hiding under duvets.the major selling point for this film was that it has a far more linear story line than many of this ilk - you get who the characters are, where they are from and what they do. you get the baseline information (nice couple, can't have children) and realise that the premise is just too normal for something freaky not to happen.and then comes the bad. the number one complaint is that the story is obvious. i got it pretty much the moment the kid hugged the tree. i knew where the film was going and was even able to predict the order of death and for what reason.the editing is shocking and unfortunately, not to the benefit of the film. even were i still pondering the events, tension isn't allowed to build because the director seems to have gotten a new editing suite for his birthday and wanted to use it as much as possible.and my final gripe is this....the tree was unnecessary. this would have been a perfectly good tale of subtle horror with just the couple breaking down over the death of the child - the titular tree bought nothing new or exciting to the film. so i'll finish where i started - my overall impression was 'oh.'

from the acclaim it got i was expecting more from a korean horror if it's going to be viewed in the same caliber as a tale of two sisters, as some other reviews have stated. this movie isn't in the same caliber except in budget spent on special effects. think amytiville horror. with a tree and sparse dialogue.if you're going to have a movie with limited dialogue, the plot line and characters have to carry the film. this film could have been told quite well in a 30 minute short film concept, 2 hours with a lot of staring at trees and terror scenes that make you not only not scared, but detract in a "what the..." sort of way does not a good horror movie make.those people who are stating that this film gave them lasting impressions must literally have heart attacks when decent horror films lay it in.

having just watched acacia, i find that i have to agree with the negative reviews here. i like asian, and korean horror, and i had great expectations for this film. man, was i disappointed. watching this, i kept thinking "surely they just do this to catch me off guard later on", and for a while i expected something ingenious to happen. however, i slowly realised that the film really is that bad. it is the cheapest cash in into the asian horror market i have seen so far. the basic story is perhaps not even that bad, but the way it is filmed it seems like the most laughable plot ever. the tree as a 'scary' device might be okay if used cleverly, but all the filmmaker does is giving us different shots of...yes, a tree, over and over again. he seems to hope that the tree will do all the work for him in terms of tension and build-up, but it just feels like what it is: shots of a tree. for goodness' sake!slow build-ups can be very effective, and a film that presents the viewer with only few glimpses of what is wrong might deliver good scares, but not acacia. sure, we get a glimpse of a child on a tricycle disappearing around a corner, and, yet again, meaningful shots of the tree from above, or underneath, or the side, but these scenes are just not scary. they feel silly, especially because you realise that the director means them to be scary. they simply aren't. apart from that i agree with some of the other reviewers, that the characters are ridiculous. in particular the one character's 'descent into madness' is laughable. however, what really breaks acacia is the terrible editing. its hard to see why scenes were cut together the way they are, but it's bad, and it kills any spark of interrest it might have had. it also makes me feel patronised, because i can see what they are trying to achieve with it, but i cannot believe that they think i would fall for such cheap ploys.there are lots of great asian ghost films, and lots of bad ones, but this is by far the worst i have seen. they must have been going through the list of 'what to put into ghost movies', and ticked them all off, but in the end they forgot to add the actual movie.

no serious spoilers, but some very minor ones."acacia", a korean contribution to the ever popular asian horror wave, concerns a husband and wife who decide that they're getting on a bit and decide to adopt a child. the child, who has an usual obsession with the dead tree in the family's garden, eventually disappears when the couple eventually have a child of their own and the aforementioned tree seems to hold a grudge against the family itself.and that's about it. the film moves at a snails pace, clocking in at over 100 minutes with 80 minute material. it is essentially a thin family drama with a creepy tree, and there is very little in the way of scares, just shots of the tree with weird mumbling noises playing over the top. however, the idea of the tree being the child's mother is a pretty original one, but it isn't exactly exploited to its full potential. this sort of separates "acacia" from much of the new wave it belongs to: films like ju-on and ring tend to do the opposite, and milk bland ideas until they are red in the face.the film does begin to get going towards the end; however the realisation of the child's fate and the parent's actions not only dampen the earlier curiosity of the story, but are revealed with such machine gun editing that it's difficult to take in all at once. the final sequence is undoubtedly creepy, however it feels like too little too late.overall, the film does not feel too much like a ring cash in, however with the "film renaissance" that korea is currently going through, i couldn't help but feel this film could have been so much more.

this movie strayed too far from straub's novel for me to enjoy. barely made it to the middle of the film. besides changing don wanderly from edwards nephew into his son, the removed most of the major scenes and a number of characters that gave the novel so much life. what was left was trash. straub's version was far superior to this poorly executed film. i don't think casting did all that great a job on picking the chowder society members either. hopefully someone will come along and actually remake this film correctly in my lifetime. i just hate when hollywood butchers the works of talented authors because they think their version so much better. makes me sick.

maybe it's because i read peter straub's wonderful book before seeing the film, but i was terribly disappointed by this movie. in my opinion, the filmmakers removed everything that made the story interesting and unique, and replaced it with more common hollywood-style elements.it's too bad, too, since this movie has a terrific cast, particularly fred astaire, douglas fairbanks, jr., melvyn douglas, john houseman, and the then-largely-unknown alice krige. they're just not given very much worthwhile to do.in fact, i was all for leaving halfway through, but a friend convinced me to stay to the end, as he was sure it had to get better. he apologised to me during the closing credits.

this story had a good plot to it about four elderly men that share a deadly secret concerning a young woman that they met 50 years ago. after all this time, the young woman returns to seek revenge on the men. this story occasionally made me nod off during the movie in the middle of tiring elevator music and the ever so consistent thunder storms. but it is well worth the wait in the end when we find out just who the mystery woman is that keeps plaguing the old men in their dreams and interfering in a young man's life. the most of what i liked in this film was the suspense in which the young woman appears to the men just before their deaths. the special effects were something. every time i heard her call out to them i would think "not that face again." but it was a good movie, i just wish that the pace was not as slow or the acting not as tiresome. and what i also liked about the movie was the flashback of the 20's, very authentic as well as the costumes being original.

this film gives new meaning to the term "uneven", giving us a few intriguing characterizations offset by an awkwardly realized plot that relies on a few well-placed stingers to deliver the majority of the thrills.the plot concerns a group of men who harbor a secret that has caused a curse to be visited on them in the form of a ghostly female apparation that causes death. she also may be seducing their sons.it is quite a spectacle to have all the notable veteran actors together in one film, but unfortunately they're not very convincing, particularly the scene where melvyn douglas goes off the deep end begging the others to listen to him. it's no shock then that the actors who play these same characters in their youth are terrible, especially the giggling ricky. they deliver the worst "gee-aren't-we-all-drunk" scene i've ever watched.the movie has a few saving graces, namely dick smith's great ghost makeups (however misplaced they are in this film), and alice krige's fascinating performance as alma/eva. i've never read the novel that this film was taken from, but i intend to after reading some of the other reviews on this page. you don't have to have read the book, however, to realize that this is only a shadow of the original tale. there is a good story here, but it seems lost somewhere, amid exposition that shows the men having nightmares over and over again and making unsubtle references to the secret they all share. as it stands, it appears as if there was about half an hour of footage removed from this print, particularly near the climax. after all...how is it that fred astaire manages to mount an excavation of the pond so quickly? what did gregory bate and the kid have to do with eva? and while we're at it...what the hell was she, anyway? why did letting her out of the car cause the apparition to disappear? if it was an apparition, how could it have sex with two men and have them not know?these and other questions will never be answered, at least not by this film. unless some restored footage is discovered somewhere, it will probably forever remain a curiosity with some oozing makeup, bizarre sex scenes and nudity, and a few attractive performances.

this is another film i missed out on italian tv as a kid: notable for its quintet of ageing stars, most of whom had never made a horror film in their life (fred astaire, melvyn douglas, douglas fairbanks jr., john houseman and patricia neal), it deals with the men’s long-concealed past crime coming back to haunt them. it takes the form of a ghostly dead-ringer for the girl they all loved (alice krige) but whom they were forced to dispose of after an unfortunate incident when she humiliated their egos! fairbanks, who was the one responsible for the deed, has twin sons (craig wasson) and so krige directs her revenge upon them as well. soon one of the latter, fairbanks himself and even douglas and houseman all wind up dead. therefore, the remaining wasson and astaire decide to confront the ghost at the scene of the crime where they also have to contend with a couple of sinister tramps who somehow do krige’s bidding! i was looking forward to seeing these veterans on their last legs (douglas died before the film had even premiered though, by that time, he had already completed another role, while it proved astaire’s own inauspicious swan-song) but ghost story went through too many changes of mood – while maintaining a sluggish pace throughout and emerging overlong into the bargain – to be anything but a failed curio. having dollops of sex (including full-frontal nudity from wasson!) and gruesome make-up effects muddled the waters all the more and marred the old-fashioned elegance inherent in jack cardiff’s (another notable of long-standing) cinematography.

ghost story has an interesting feminist revenge tale premise, a-list veteran actors, colorful flashbacks with nifty look-a-like youthful counterparts of the old men. scary staccato music heralding the approaching horrors, atmospheric new england winter weather, and an excellent charismatic actress in the title role. ghost story could have been much more effective in black and white and in eliminating some of the more lurid special effects, and to presenting a more cogent screenplay (we should not have to be wondering about why the two trailer-parkish acolytes are in the script) the biggest detriment of the film is craig wassan (definitely separated at birth from bill maher) who from perhaps editing or just bad acting, is totally ineffective. he seems to "specialize" in wide-eyed, wide-mouthed reaction shots; not a lot of personality here. the revelation however is alice krige, pale-faced, enigmatic, terrifying underneath the placid exterior. however, her eva galli is creepy even before she meets her fate; i mean, a young woman who says things like "i'd like to take a bite out of you" or "dance with me, you little toad!" is already not in the land of the living. ghost story would have been much better in a low-key, val lewton mode. the overdone special effects completely undercut the chill factor.

all that talent.....but when ya have poor direction, and a weak screenplay, it doesnt matter who is in a movie. very tired attempt at telling a tale..which was actually interesting in the beginning, but then quickly fell apart toward the end....to bad.

i must not have seen the same movie as the one the comments refer to here. first, i think they should have serialized ghost story if they were going to film it at all. the truncated version they come up with was awful. i felt the performances were mannered and so much was left out of the story that the performances of such masters as astaire, douglas, houseman, and fairbanks seemed hammy. alice krige was superb as eva, though. craig wasson is a good actor but he was only adequate as the protagonist. the decision to cast patricia neal and to truncate her role was not a good one. imagine what anne bancroft would have done with that character! i blame the script, which was poor. the production values were dark and the pacing was slow. a disappointing, pedestrian effort.the book is one of the five greatest suspense/horror novels of the 20th century, imho. but the movie was disappointing, although a great introduction for krige.

i can't express enough just how bad this film was. first of all what a waste of some legendary stars although they are quite old and pretty unconvincing. fred astaire, well i guess he must have owed some one a big favor as this was his last film role. the script is a mess and the film seems terribly draggy. i imagine maybe if i saw this back when it came out (1981) i might have thought it was decent. however seeing so many actual good horror films, this was one of the worst. the only real convincing anything in this mess was the very young and lovely sort/of creepy alice krige. the main young character was trying to act the best he could but was utterly terrible. i wasn't sure how much of it was from his lack of skill or the lack of a comprehend-able script, but either way he was just plain bad. don't watch unless you want to see a bunch of old guys be somewhat scared.

the other boleyn girl - not to be confused with the book it claims to be based upon. this movie is not even close to a faithful adaptation. i could understand them changing or elaborating on a few things. the book is not perfection, but it was well-written and became very popular. i could understand if the bbc wanted to make this a little more faithful to what actually happened, who anne boleyn really was - but it's not even close to being historically accurate either. it's just fluff. mindless, made-up fluff. a real shame.to begin with, the writer and director seemed to think it was a good idea to setup the story like it was a reality tv show. seriously. they have the boleyns sitting in front of the camera, confessing how they really feel about what's happening in their lives. anne boleyn sits in a confessional (not the church kind, the real world kind) and chooses what she wants to tell and what she wants to just sit and smile about. she looks stupid having to use such a modern cinematic device in a film set in the 1500s. it's "the real world: tudor england!" jodhi may is a very good actress and after 'the aristocrats' and 'a turn of the screw' i was becoming a real fan of hers. but she should never have been cast as anne. actually i think she would have been a better mary. natascha mcelhone was a poor choice. she's a good actress, sure, but she has very modern features and does not appear convincing in period costume. (honestly, i spent the first half of the film trying to figure out if she was "that girl" from 'the truman show.' she was.) she's also too old to play the teen-aged mary so for some unknown reason they made mary the oldest of the sisters. it makes no sense, i know. it's like the bbc seemed to forget that these people actually lived. they're twisting the story around and making things up left and right. i feel ridiculous having to correct the bbc on historical inaccuracies, but really! apart from the two sisters the rest of the cast was actually very well chosen. steven mackintosh struck me as a brilliant choice for george, and his casting was the real reason i decided to seek out this movie. big mistake. he does a great job, sure, but he's hardly in this. how can anyone pretend they're adapting the other boleyn girl and hardly mention george boleyn? that's just absurd. philip glenister was another very good casting decision, but yet again, was hardly in the finished product. the real problem with this is the script. there's just no getting around that. it's bad. it's really, really bad. it's too melodramatic and not engaging. anne is portrayed as an air-head, mary as the ringleader, and george as the follower. mary's first husband is hardly mentioned, her relationship with the king is never explained - they simply do not tell the story phillippa gregory wrote. the whole thing comes across as a great big waste. i have no desire to see this thing a second time. i guess i'll just have to read the book again and hope that the natalie portman version due out next year will be much better.*note: as of this writing, the only way of obtaining this miniseries in the usa is on the last disc of the miniseries 'the six wives of henry viii.' that's a great miniseries but can cost $50 to $60 and that's way to much to spend if you're just looking for this piece of garbage.

i realize a period piece is expensive to make, and that this style of shooting (close framed shots to camera, moving camera, wide aperture shots, washed-out) allows such films to be made for a price. as a style, it has advantages and disadvantages like any other, it allows more period pieces to be made. like any style it has its detractors and supporters - there are probably even those that believe that this manner of shooting has an artistic basis.if only some of the money saved, could have been spent on the script for whatever style is used, a film needs good writing and good acting.the acting in this film is mostly very good. the writing less so. it is composed of a collection of bits taken from the book and much which is relevant to the plot is left out making for a disjointed collection of scenes with little or no continuity.if you have read the book, do not under any circumstances watch it. if you have not read the book, are easily pleased and have nothing better to do there is no harm in watching it, but be prepared to be disappointed.it could have been so much better.

this movie was included in the six wives of henry viii bbc miniseries dvd. i loved those six movies. they were well-acted, well-scripted, and historically accurate. i did actually read gregory's book and liked it well enough despite it's huge historical inaccuracies (i mean the whole fake homosexual angle with george boleyn in particular), but this movie didn't even mention that. that angle was one of the pivotal points of the book. above all this movie just leaves me asking "why?" why do we see, as someone else aptly put, "the real world: tudor england"? why are the camera angles so bad in general? why is the script so bad? i mean, i know it was improv, but come on! the actors at time stutter and stammer over their lines and it's obvious that they're making them up as they go along.why are the sex scenes so awkward? the way they were done in the book made them at least somewhat interesting. in the movie they're just bad, verging on being absolutely hilarious. at one point, the actress playing mary boleyn was having sex with the actor playing henry viii. he's thrusting away and she's got this look on her face that says "hm....i need to go to the store. is he done yet? maybe if he finishes i can go pick up some cheese real quick..." it's just bad.why does catherine of aragon play such a small role in this movie? her refusal to get a divorce was one of the leading causes for the scandal that rocked christiandom. she's the reason why henry viii and anne boleyn couldn't get immediately married. why is she not present here? over all, this movie is just bad.

this movie twists the facts of anne and mary's lives into something unrecognizable. to make mary boleyn, who in fact was a rather dim and foolish creature, and make her the "good" sister is just silly. it is anne who was in fact the far more interesting character, and that is why it is her life, and not mary's, that has been told so often.in response to an earlier review, i fail to see how anne's life was so "criminal"... to me it's henry who was the real criminal. whatever anne's motives for winning the king and withholding her affections in order to gain a crown and husband has to be taken into context of the time in which these real-life events took place. anne, in comparison to the majority of most of the courtiers in her time, was a relatively innocent figure. most modern historians discount or have disproven most of the myths and slanders that this movie perpetuate about her, and i have never heard of anyone who actually believes the rumour than she slept with her brother. this movie is so sensational and false that it is maddening to think that someone, without knowing anything about this period in history, could walk away believing anything this movie has presented as "fact".i won't even get into the weird filming of the movie... but i'm pretty sure that cameras weren't invented in the 16th century, so i don't understand why anne and mary are talking to one throughout the movie... it's a really bad plot devise and is jarring and annoying, to put it mildly.anne of the thousand days is not accurate either, but is infinitely more entertaining and at least comes closer to telling the story of one of the most intriguing women of history. don't even think about renting this.. it's two hours you'll never get back!

i was surprised after watching this piece of crap , if you have seen an episode of tom and jerry in which jerry pours some liquid onto him and becomes invisible than you are likely to see the same cartoons with added erotic topping a man becoming invisible and doing s*i* is the conclusion of the movie. involving too much sex in a cartoon themed movie doesn't increase its worth :( , and most of all i was surprised when the same cartoon ending was used to show up the mr.invisible and that was really awful i must say , flour drops off the rack and our very own mr.invisible becomes visible "watch zack and miri make a porno" i bet you wont get bored, 1/10 from me

after just viewing the movie, i must say this is one of the worst films i have ever seen. this takes my worst movie award away from komodo, which is no easy feat. it is neither a porno nor a legitimate film and it gives them both a bad name. the acting, camera-work, plot, script, and sound are all awful. my personal favorite part of the movie is the duck asking the bartender if he has any grapes. why was a joke such as this put in the film? was the director thinking; "i need a humorous scene to balance out the great acting so i will use some lame ass joke i read on a laffy taffy wrapper." another retarded part is when norman spills the invisibility potion on himself as he attempts to keep it from spilling. why did they even bother to give the film a nc-17 rating, were they hoping to get as large of an audience as possible? at least if it were rated x it would be more sexual and therefore taking the viewers focus away from the overall low quality. i pray for someone who worked on this panty waste of a flick to respond.

i rented this type of "soft core" before, but i can honestly say, i wasn't expecting this to be in the same type as "rod steele: you only live until you die"--which was both sexy and funny. it had a good script, a sincere leading man, and a sense of purpose. it also has gabriella hall who is hot. the reason why i didn't expect this movie, was because the box was missing the "must be 18 to rent" sticker. i was looking for more "cheese" and less "cheesecake."first of all, i think movies shouldn't be allowed to start with "actors" rehearsing for a part at a talent agency (or wherever "actors" rehearse). in this movies seeing the "actors" rehearsing highlights the lack of preparation that went into acting out the real characters in the movie.okay, having found out that this was a soft core movie, i didn't necessarily turn it off and demand my money back. but, the dizzying way the extended video "erotic" scenes are added to what was probably a late night pay-cable release are very annoying and easy to fast-forward through without the sustained quality of, say, rod steele. you know they must've had some money, because i think some of it is filmed overseas.i will have to say the main actor trying not to spill the invisibility potion on himself is one of the most baffling acting jobs i've ever seen. and, i've seen torgo from manos! it may actually have been worth the dollar rental fee (that and gabriella hall). still, there are better corny movies to rent with your friends.

what can have been on irene dunne's mind when she accepted the role in this distasteful account of a woman of negotiable morals? certainly, the irene dunne of the 1940's, whose reputation as a faithful roman catholic who publicly abhorred smut, and shunned any film scripts or hollywood society, that might be even be remotely construed as corrupting public morals--would never have become associated with such a dubious project as this.perhaps, new york's cardinal spellman, in his private audience with her, gave her a good dressing down over this role? that we will likely never know, inasmuch as she never spoke of it in later years, though she did denounce her morally suspect, (though quite successful) 1932 film, "back street" as "trash".certainly by the time she received the distinguished st. robert bellarmine award in 1965 for exemplary public catholicism, "ann vickers" was no longer recalled by the general public.suffice it to say that "ann vickers" works neither as entertainment or social commentary.miss dunne's role as an adulterous social worker, who sleeps around, (between reforming prisons and writing a best seller on correctional rehabilitation) doesn't dovetail with her temperament or on screen demeanor, and one keeps suspecting that the whole thing is a kind of tongue in cheek gag, (what else can we think when we witness a montage of miss dunne's sympathetic beatific gaze superimposed over a shot of a female prisoner being scourged?) by films end, she has renounced careerism in favor of marriage, (to crusty convict walter huston no less--and what kind of lunacy would ever conceive of pairing these two romantically?) irene dunne completists will no doubt wish to see this curiosity, if only for the chance to hear her promise to rehabilitate a cocaine addict under her charge: "i'm going to get you off the snow cold turkey" !!! well, if nothing else such sordid goings on, do present her light years from her usual milieu of operatic trills, furbellowed chiffon and strawberry phosphates--cocaine addiction not being the first subject one associates with the irreproachable miss dunne.

not one of monogram's better(not trying to be amusing here either)chan entries. the shanghai cobra has a lot going for it, but, in the end, is just way too confusing and cluttered to be overly satisfying. the film opens with a murderer named the shanghai cobra having already struck twice and now is about in a scene at a diner in some way. we have a guy, a girl, and another guy having some implied connection when one guy dies in the streets. yes, i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity, for this really is at the core of the problems with this film - it has too much going on without any real, fulfilling explanation. i haven't even gone into the diner cook who has some involvement and a juke box that talks to you and has a screen and everyone doesn't seem to have a problem with that! all this is in the first five minutes or so. then chan enters film working for the government and flying out to help a friend. he also has right to check a bank's store of radium and is looking for a man wrapped in bandages that he helped arrest in shanghai many years earlier. i found the plot very involved as stated earlier. toler is back as chan. he is ever affable. benson fong and mantan moreland are back too. both do good jobs and are quite amusing. but the convoluted plot just didn't convince me, and much of the film was watched with a weird, questioning glance. this isn't a bad movie not just a very interesting one except for the most devoted of chan fans.

loosely based on novels by earl derr biggers, 20th century fox's charlie chan series proved an audience favorite--but when japan attacked pearl harbor the studio feared audiences would turn against its asian hero. this was a miscalculation: actor sidney toler took the role to "poverty row" monogram studios, where he continued to portray the character in eleven more films made between 1944 and his death in 1947.20th century fox had regarded the chan films as inexpensive "b" movies, but even so the studio took considerable care with them: the plots were often silly, but the pace was sharp, the dialogue witty, and the casts (which featured the likes of bela lugosi and ray milland) always expert. the result was a kindly charm which has stood the test of time. monogram was a different matter: chan films were "b" movies plain and simple. little care was taken with scripts or cast and resulting films were flat, mediocre at best, virtually unwatchable at worst.thanks to an adequate cast and a few interesting plot devices, the shanghai cobra is among the best of the monogram-made chan films--but even so it barely manages to achieve a consistent mediocrity. in this particularly entry, chan (sidney toler) is called upon to investigate a murderer who kills with what appears to be a cobra-like bite; at the same time, he decides to make certain that a government supply of radium tucked away in a bank vault, of all places, remains secure. do these two seemingly unrelated plot lines come together? well... could be! sidney toler is always enjoyable as chan, but most of his monogram performances seemed "phoned in"--and that is as true of cobra as it is of any monogram chan film. as usual, the really enjoyable performer is mantan mooreland. changing times have led us to look upon moreland's brand of comedy as demeaning to african-americans, but he was an expert actor and comic, and taken within the context of what was possible for a black actor in the 1940s his work has tremendous charm and innocence.fans of the 20th century fox series are likely to find monogram's chan a significant disappointment and newcomers who like the monogram films will probably consider them third-rate after encountering the fox films. like other monogram chan films, the shanghai cobra is best left to determined collectors. four stars, and that's being generous.gft, amazon reviewer

i just spent the last half an hour reading through the other reviews and i don't know if i want to laugh or cry. there's no way that adjl is like harry potter, danny phantom, fairly oddparents, other then a secret magical world, which has been close to overdone. also, no way is adjl anime. anime is very much a drawing style(and some will say more, such as plot and japanese origin), either way adjl is not anime so stop saying it is and if you're looking for something that is like anime, look else where, like teen titans and avatar.adjl is typical. it's just like all the other disney shows. an arrogant main character kid who thinks he knows everything and doesn't bother to listen to people who're older than him and continues to make the same mistakes. best friend sidekicks. repeative plot with a hint of a twist. and sibling rivalry. can't they once make a character that has brains and isn't full of himself? can't they have kids respect their elders? can't they think of something different with the plot? can't they have the siblings get along and not hate each other? adjl is just too generic, because you also have bad guys that get defeated and come back again, and are also complete idiots, that have no background for their hate. c'mon, you'll think that someone who's at least 30 will be able to out-wit a 13 year old.watching adjl is like watching nearly anything else on tv these day, same thing over and over again. nothing special, just new designs characters and one small idea that has been used again and again.

not really worth a review, but i suppose it's my duty to warn you all - especially since there are some pretty good reviews of this canadian bomb floating around out there... bad acting and a slow moving, absolutely atrociously boring 'coming of age' tale in which 3 boys lives are turned upside down when a man on the run shows up at their clubhouse in the woods. at firs the boys make good with the intruder and at one point even view him as some sort of a role model... however all this changes... and you still won't care. you will recognize chris penn, whose biggest cinematic impact is corky romano, and a young devon sawa, whose career peaked at 'casper'. i was hoping for a '12 and holding', 'the war', or 'lie' and all i got was a waste of time. this film struggles to keep it's audiences attention and never makes an impact or maintains a note of anything remotely interesting.

this was an attempt toward a romantic comedy, and one which did not work. although the film was cast in an interesting manner, the dismal script betrayed the best efforts of all. the director's fey mannerisms may have succeeded if he had adopted a point of view. it was embarrassing to watch william baldwin and, in particular, armin muller-stahl.

not having any idea what this film was about, but based on the fact that john leguizamo was appearing in it, we decided to watch it. well, it turned out not to be the wisest decision. in fact, as another commentary in this forum puts it, we felt embarrassed for the actors that participated in this movie.while the film is by no means horrible, it doesn't make sense at all. the over the top performance by william baldwin doesn't help the situation either. john leguizamo is a multi-talented actor who deserved better. the basic problem it seems to be the film was a project that started with good intentions in making a little comedy and the people in charge ran out of ideas along the way. the result is an uneven film.

!!!! mild spoilers !!!!the premise goes like this : a store gets burnt down and assistant sergio is asked by the father of the man who started the fire to take the wrap to which sergio agrees .so far so good , but there`s a fair lapse of logic involved sergio agrees to do this for the sum of 25,000 dollars but why ? come on guys if you were a good looking white boy would you run the risk of getting a long spell in a tough jail ( a very real possibilty for arson ) for the sake of 25 grand ? i know i wouldn`t , and seeing as you`d have a criminal record no employer would want to touch you with a barge pole so is $25,000 dollars all that much for a life of workfare and welfare cheques ? there`s also something else that seems to have gone without notice from the premise , since mister lumpke has told sergio that his son did the fire he seems unware of the possibility that he may know too much . wouldn`t alarm bells be ringing in your mind about someone wanting to keep you quite if they told you something ? i guess we`re not suppossed to think about such details since a pyromaniac`s love story isn`t suppossed to be an intelligent thriller , it`s a light hearted romantic comedy/ chick flick that`s probably best apprieciated as a girls night in . looking through this comments page it is obvious that the movie has its defenders but as a cynical male i wasn`t too impressed and william baldwin does go way over the top

started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters. in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all. the scenes between the bakery owner and the assistant were nice but the rest was just very slow. it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film. the characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce. by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didn't care what happened next and so i switched off. glad i didn't pay to see it. didn't laugh or even smile once. there seems to be a strange tendency for americans to classify their films as 'comedy' when they are funny peculiar rather than funny ha ha. i have finally learned to avoid what americans term dark comedies which usually turn out to be gruesome weird and unfunny. now it looks like i will have to be a bit more discerning when they call a film romantic comedy as well. maybe comedy means something different when applied to a film rather than a series in america. i don't understand why america can produce amazingly funny comedies like two and a half men, will and grace, king of queens but can't seem to produce really funny films without resorting to toilet humour. this film wasn't gross or anything. but it wasn't anything at all just one big yawn...

laughable.clichéd.overdoses on style to compensate for poor writing.remember when mtv actually used to air music videos and other shows besides reality shows? aeon flux (2005) is based upon one such show  a cartoon from the mid-90s  featuring a superhuman female protagonist in black latex clothing. aeon, played by the lovely charlize theron in this adaptation, is a cold detached rebel who is as dexterous as a line-dancer and as deadly as a viper-snake. she needs to be, if she expects to kick the asses of the totalitarian government.i love science fiction, but hate the sudden influx of half-assed futuristic dystopian technology-overdosed films like the island (2005) and equilibrium (2002) (bottom of the pile). aeon flux has all the problems that are present in these films, but amplified. that is, there is nothing original left to show so they compensate for it with the sleek style that matrix (1999) catalyzed. the special effects are therefore sensational in aeon flux which earns it a few points, but scratch the surface and there is literally nothing there.to make matters worse, all performances in this film are atrocious and some actually wound me to watch. charlize theron's character aeon flux is interwoven with the most cheesy tough-chick schtick and it seems as though the director karyn kusama cannot quite decide where to go with her next  should she make her more detached or more emotional? she doesn't know! let's go both ways! imagine you take a shotgun, load it chock-full of character developments of different sorts and there fire into a random mess. this is the character of aeon flux.the film aeon flux puts forward all the 'mandatory' ideas in a dystopian society - individual vs. society, nature vs. science, emotion vs. cold reason, etc. you've seen all of this before, and better done at that. go read orwell, bradbury or huxley, or even watch logan's run (1976) or blade runner (1982)... anything! avoid this viciously uninvolving cheese-fest for as long as you can.3/10

i got to know æon back in the early 90s via television and i loved it...what did you like about it ? the cranky drawing style ? the flawless artistic action involved ? the absurd and deadpan communication between the characters ? the whole layout of the surrounding future world ? no matter what you loved about it...the aeon flux film of late 2005 has nothing of that.karyn kusama, the so called "director" of the film, was hopelessly over-strained with transporting the original content to a new film. if you 're not familiar with the original series, you won't understand anything during for the first 60minutes of the film.the story is inscrutable and the vapid characters do not develop during the film.kusama's attempt to improve the storyline by implementing some rather weak explanatory conversations between the main characters is not only a lame attempt to cover up her flaws as a storyteller , it's simply unworthy of the original æon concept.charlize theron might be an attractive woman, but she can't impersonate the æon character. although she was attached to strings doing action scenes, her lack of talent for physical motion simply ruins the action sequences in the film. the result is a tremendous amount of hectic picture cuts to cover up the sheer lameness of her physique.forget about all the rest, it's not worth talking about...i give 1point for ms.theron showing her boobs and 1point for the nice architectural photography in the film. that's it.

while aeon flux was mildly entertaining and a slightly better way to spend a wednesday evening than the pub, i did leave pleased that i had got buy one get one free tickets. knowing nothing about the film as i went in, in fact i didn't even know there was an animated series before i read this site, i was ready for anything, and as some other viewers noted, the trailers showing a well filmed, good looking, and interesting piece of cinema had pulled me in. half way through the film though i was kind of disappointed, it did remind me of the fifth element but i too feel it just lacked the extra bit of depth and left me with the empty feeling. and enough of the pointless and slightly boring gun fights, if you're going to do them, do it with some style, not just loads of explosions and inept guards falling down. personally i'd rather have seen a bit more about the story and the people in the city or got to know more about how the chairman was being undermined, than yet another long and loud gun fight.

critics have started calling it the oscar winner club, understandably. what after halle berry won it for monsters ball then going straight to the diabolical catwoman. hilary swank triumphs in boys don't cry and follows it with the core. jamie foxx takes a nosedive as a pilot in the dull stealth after scooping a gong for ray. now it's seems hollywood starlet charlize theron craps all over her "monster" oscar with this one of the worst sci-fi spectacles ever made.the film loses its audience interest after a mere 20 minutes meaning the only thing really worth staying for is the fact that despite the film being rubbish charlize theron is still an exceptional actress who is clearly making the best of a crude and laughable premise. not only is æon flux ultimately shallow but for an action flick it's also really very dull. it will only really appeal to comic book fans and horney teenagers who like the idea of theron running around half naked for 90 minutes. flux only really succeed in failing.set against the 2011 virus that kills 99% of the world's populace, and in the last city on earth, bregna, the survivors, some four hundred years later, in the year 2415, are continuing to live in the goodchild dynasty, the name of the scientist who developed its cure.all is not well in this utopia and it is not what lies beyond its high walls that protects its citizens from the never ending jungle but what unspoken, unwritten taboo that holds and binds these unwritten taboo that holds and binds these unfortunates' together that lies within these walls of paranoia, conformity and unquestionable obedience. filmed in and around berlin, ironically, this is a story set against a totalitarian state, a walled city, where its peoples are no longer capable of reproducing, and its sinister and most secret plot of how it sustains life.æon flux is the assassin that has been assigned by the underground rebels to change the course of mankind, forever. this is the story of her fight for justice, freedom and revenge.æon flux combined lousy narratives, ropy pacing and truly dire effects. looking more like an unrealistic video game rather than a film. the only thing that is fortunate about the failure is that no sequels are in the works, flux might just be the beginning and the end of what could have been one of the worst franchises in history, thank god for the lousy box office takings then.my final verdict on this truly lousy feature? there really isn't a story here just charlize theron jumping around in a black suit like a grass hopper. the acting is very wooden moronic and emotionless compared to the other cinemas that are out there today. it try's too much to be like an adaption and doesn't really take much from the cartoon which is what i was expecting, the only thing that was done half right that pays tribute to the cartoon was the fly in the eye scene. avoid at all costs.

right up (or down) there with toys and jurassic park 2 and the phantom menace.the premise sounded cool, some of the commercials looked semi-promising, but alas, the entire movie had about 30 seconds of neat shot-ness, and that was shown on the small screen's 30 second slot.if you want amateur writing, second-rate effects, ridiculous costumes, and an all-around snoozefest by all means watch it. the plot is recycled sci-fi fodder. too bad too, because coming in i thought it would be bad but held out hope. it may be the worst movie i have ever seen, and i have seen a lot. bottom line - don't watch it.unless of course you -liked- any of the above 3 movies.

the mtv sci-fi animated series "æon flux" is brought to life with charlize theron playing the title character, a freedom fighter who fights oppression in the walled city of bregna, 400 hundred years into the future. for her latest mission, she has been sent to kill the city's leader trevor goodchild (marton csokas), but she uncovers secrets along the way.aeon flux falls under the category of good premise, mediocre execution. interesting story yet the film was a little dull. a lot of people are saying that this is one of the worst movies of the year and that's not true at all. it may be a disappointing film but it's an average film at best. i have never seen the cartoon version of the movie so i can't compare the two. it's probably better because they have a chance to explain the story more. the film is not that confusing but it's easy to get lost if you're not familiar with the material. the acting was alright, nothing special. charlize theron gives a good performance and seems dedicated to the film. the rest of the cast also give decent performances including jonny lee miller, frances mcdormand and marton csokas. there are also more than a few interesting characters in the film including sithandra, aeon's friend.the problem with aeon flux is that it takes itself too seriously. it carries the same serious tone throughout the entire film and that gets a little tiring. there's no humor and the film becomes a little boring at times. this is the same problem that elektra had. because the film is so serious, the dialog sounds cheesy and the serious scenes seem forced. the action scenes are pretty good but that's not what the film is really about so don't go in expecting just an action movie. the twist at the end isn't mind blowing but it's still a nice ending and better than other thrillers that have come out this past year (hide and seek). the costumes are little weird but still look nice and interesting. the visuals were are also done well so the film at least looks nice. so, the movie may be a case of style over substance. interesting to look at but may not hold your attention for a very long time. in the end, it's not the best film out there but it might for a decent rental. rating 4/10

if you're a fan of the original series, do not see this movie.i should have been skeptical from the previews when aeon expresses her motives for murder. in the series aeon had no family and no motive for her adventures save selfish interests. obviously the chimp-writer in charge felt the movie needed to cater to the "bad grrl" demographic by making the character deadly, but have a good reason to kill people.you wouldn't have thought it possible, but the movie is more two dimensional than the cartoon. the characters are all portrayed as inherently good with some conflict of interest that eventually gets resolved. all dogs go to heaven, and same for every character that dies in this movie.the selfish,twisted,perverted, dominating personas of aeon and trevor are nowhere to be seen. in the end they literally develop into a cutesy couple ala annie hall. the only character who remained true to the show was the relicle, the floating machine in the sky. i suppose if you ever thought "gee, i like aeon flux, but i wish it were more like every other faceless good-v-evil sci-fi hollywood slop out there", then you are in for a treat.they didn't even get the look right. i suppose a black metal bikini was too much to ask for, but the whole setting is wrong. 400 years into the future sure looks like 30 years into the past. instead of a distinctly urban post-apocalyptic world, the viewer's eyes are offended with a 70's mod-squad frutopia of egg-shaped furniture, wood paneled walls, earth tones, and lots of plants. bregna was a dystopia, not a utopia.speaking of bregna, that's the only city on earth according to the movie. the show is clear that there are two cities, bregna and monica, which used to be one. in the movie, the "monicans" are just hollywood storybook freedom-fighters. they also have as much technology as the bregnans, which is not the case from the show.the only possible conclusion is that the real writer for this movie was a high school kid, and that he wrote it the day before it was due to the studio execs, and he's never seen an entire aeon flux all the way through. the overwhelming amount of inconsistency with the cartoon is baffling. beyond using certain names like aeon flux, trevor goodchild, and bregna, the movie is nothing like the show.the actual bulk of the movie seems to try to blend the colorful plots of soy-lent green, blade runner, logan's run, and tomb raider, which came out a dull brown mess.

it's a bit unnerving when a studio declines to screen a film for the press before it goes into wide release. that many movies suck is no surprise, but when a studio itself admits as much ahead of time, the process of movie-going becomes a passion play of sorts. consider it an early christmas gift from hollywood, then, that "aeon flux" isn't nearly the affront to taste and decency one might expect, given the above. though ultimately overwhelmed by its flaws, it at least has (sort of) an idea with which to toy around. too bad director karyn kusama seems to have little clue how to execute it all.it's the future. there's been a plague. there is a dictatorship, and there are rebels. the latter are known as the monicans, and far from being a cult of beret or tennis racket worshipers, they're into attempts to overthrow the former, called the goodchild regime. the regime is occasionally mean to the citizenry, which is more than aeon flux (charlize theron) and her pals can stand. through some sort of biochemical virtual reality technology, the monicans receive orders from their dear leader (frances mcdormand), a mystical priestess-type who appears to have been cross-bred with a carrot. it falls to aeon to strap on some form-fitting, futuristic spandex get-ups to carry out the high carrot's orders, which are of course some version of "destroy the regime." having years earlier watched her sister get liquidated by the goodchilds, she needs little convincing.not surprisingly, things get complicated. the goodchilds might not be quite what they seem, and aeon herself might have an unexpected history with them. though occasionally muddled, the film's central conceit (of which i won't reveal more) contains some neat notions about the nature of human existence and survival. there's room for much more examination of which the film doesn't take advantage, but the ideas are there, at least. the big problems of "aeon flux" are technical. kusama has made the baffling decision to film nearly all the action so close that we can rarely follow what's going on. to make matters worse, it's edited in a flurry of jump cuts that leave us completely lost. the result is some serious spacial disorientation that takes over the film. "aeon flux"'s aesthetic is one of sleek costume, oddly-angled architecture, and nimble characters. much of the action occurs in minimalist, open spaces that beg for some unbroken long shots that might convey the grace and athleticism implied by the above. instead, we get split seconds of flying limbs, breaking glass, and accompanying sound effects.there is a pretty good movie trying to get out of the morass of "aeon flux." put this stuff in the hands of the wachowski brothers, say, and the results could be quite different. as it is, though, i felt like "aeon flux" was willfully pushing me away from a movie i wanted to enjoy. this film is unattuned to its own strengths. like a novice poker player dealt a royal flush, it somehow finds a way to lose in spite of its potential.

in the animated series: aeon flux was an amoral rebel that was completely detached from everything and everyone. she was cruel, selfish, loving, unpredictable, witty, caustic, confident, sarcastic, lethal, untamable, ambiguous all at once. the original aeon had layers upon layers of depth. she almost never allowed her personal emotions to show through. the original plot was deliciously ambiguous and thought provoking. you could never tell what aeon's motives were. aeon was a militant anarchist whereas trevor was a radical idealist, because of this they could never have any semblance of a stable relationship.in the movie:aeon flux works for the monicans and her political motives and personal motives are very clear. she was pretty, loving, vulnerable, easily tamable, emotional and very predictable. the aeon in the movie had one layer of depth at most. the plot was obvious and contrived. everything is completely laid out for you from the beginning. there was virtually no conflict between aeon and trevor, at least in terms of personal philosophies. the only conflict between them was that they were on different sides.the movie was a horrible disappointment to me. i felt betrayed. they took the idea of one of my favorite animated characters of all time, squeezed all the depth and personality out of her, and pumped her full of hollywood clichés. the essence of the animated series was completely lost in this movie. the only reason i'm not giving this movie a "1" is because the visuals were incredible. it was neat to see some of the familiar animated scenes like the fly in the eye done with cgi.

joan crawford is convincingly disfigured as our story starts, and of course she get fixed up. but she's a bad egg, exploiting one guy, while living out another guy's anti-social philosophy. all of this takes place in sweden, which is truly bizarre. it causes anything and everything memorable in the visuals, which are freed from having to depict anytown usa, but it makes a viewer wonder why every remake since is burdened and rendered unspecific by the need to americanize everything. there is plot, plot, plot so chatty that you could drown in it, and making matters worse is a framing device that adds zilch to the movie. the photography is occasionally nice, with odd angles and miniatures incorporated quite well. but it's overwrought without ever once drawing you in.

this film is a cash in. a cash in reliant on a rousing theme tune created for an earlier classic. yul brynner has long since jumped ship and so have most of the production values. lee van cleef takes over the lead role of chris. i can't think of any actor who looks less like brynner than van cleef. hey, he could have at least shaved off his hair and lost the moustache, just for the sake of continuity. some correctional centres show this movie in order to punish offenders. one step out of line and the magnificent seven ride! is brought to the fore and wielded. they didn't even bother trying to make this movie not look like a tv movie! abysmal.

the series finally hits rock-bottom with this lousy fourth installment, which was (thank god) the last one. none of the three sequels did justice to the highly entertaining original, but this particular film is nothing more than a shameless attempt to exploit the name of the "magnificent seven" and bernstein's rousing music theme. the production values resemble those of a made-for-tv movie and the characters are forgettable and indistinguishable: in parts "ii" and "iii" you couldn't remember their names, here you can't even remember their faces. lee van cleef was an inappropriate choice for the role of chris, but nobody could have replaced yul brynner in our minds anyway. don't waste your time.

i would bet a month's salary "the magnificent seven returns" (msr) was made-for-tv. other reviewers attest that msr was a theatrical movie, and i'll take their word for it. the logical answer must assume it was originally shot for tv, and after a change-of-studio-heart, it was released theatrically instead. every actor is primarily a tv actor: mariette hartley, michael callen, ralfe waite, stephanie powers... tv performers all. lee van cleef split his time between tv and theater screens. stephanie powers has only made 3 or 4 "real" movie appearances in the last thirty years of a very prolific television career - proof positive this was shot for tv. minor players are veteran small-screen actors who can be seen on old reruns of "gunsmoke", "wild wild west," "streets of san francisco," and so on.the ho-hum sets are identical to the universal studios tour sets, often seen in old episodic tv. and the editing betrays the one-or-two-takes-hurriedness of tv, with limited camera movements, positioning, cutting, and lighting. the sound track, exclusive of the original berstein themes, are straight from seventies television. yep, i'd bet money it was shot for tv.that's an important point in evaluating msr. initially i watched msr on cable assuming it was an old theatrical release. in comparison to the original "magnificent seven", it's a joke, a cartoon, an amateurish attempt at movie making. acting, lighting, writing, settings, action, cinematography, music (exempting the berstein themes), editing, pacing,...on and on....all pale in comparison to the classic "magnificent seven" which is close to the perfect 60's western, and one of the great action movies of all time. however, viewed as an early 70's made-for-tv movie, as i suspect, the film is actually better than average. those unfortunate enough to live through the 70's as an adult, know what i'm talking about. msr would have competed against "alias smith and jones" and similarly bland network shows. during the seventies, "gunsmoke" was a quality show, concentrating on character development rather than action, deemphasizing gun play to two shootouts a week. the first shooting, usually a murder, sets the hour's plot into motion - the second shootout climaxes the episode by killing the guest star, his nemesis, or otherwise resolving the conflict with marshal matt dillon. msr has more action than a whole season of "gunsmoke." in this light - in this frame of reference - msr is passable entertainment, a cut above the tv fare from that decade.

i guess i should now comment upon a 4th flick in the magnificent seven franchise; the sequels still surprise or amaze meby their sleaze and deliberate _absurdism. they constitute or forge a 4th waynot classic, not revisionist, not europeanbut a sleaze americana, kindred to the violent vigilante '70s movies, absurd trash. this installment too is bombastic sleazeinexplicably awkward and even somewhat strange.now what i find disturbing that these sequels not only have their opportunist fans; but that the fans simply do not sense any difference between the original's style and the sequels'.these sequels are not boring or insipidbut bizarre. they are of course very badly writtenmessy scripts, rubbish lines. it's straight crazy; in this installment each gunman gets several women van cleef's young wife begs him to release a young prisoner; he finally does. the young man resumes his life, shoots van cleef, kidnaps the wife, rapes and kills herthen joins a wrongdoer. van cleef, who has previously refused to help defending a village, now assembles a small bunch and charges the wrongdoer's hacienda; then the wrongdoers charge the village where van cleef has set.i liked the cast.van cleef is chris; stefanie powers, pretty active in the '70s screwy westerns, is van cleef's darling. callan, very antipathetic, is noah, a writer and chris' sidekick. the rest of the aggressive bunch are askew (one of the only three survivors), armendariz, lucking, lauter; rita rogers is truly hot, fleshy beauty.

the director was probably still in his early learning stages when he tried his hand at westerns. have a look at the outfits. everybody looks well-scrubbed, well-brushed, well-dressed and well-ironed as though ready for church. even the horses look well-groomed and shiny. this is a western, for crying out loud! it's supposed to look dusty, nasty and sweaty. and then there's the amateurish acting of the females in this bird. the whole lot, a dozen or so, all pretty and well-endowed, were just freshly raped and widowed, but hardly a tear flows. instead they all look with great interest (if not downright lust) at the newly arrived magnificent seven who they subsequently feed, bandage and comfort with love during their battles with the bandits. the same directing criticism goes for lee van cleef, who does a reasonable good acting job. our lee, playing the law, just lost his dear wife. but lee, hard as organic rock, shows no emotion whatsoever and finds himself within days of his spouse's demise in the arms of a juicy widow with whom he, together with her brood, walks off into the future. the cad. and then there's another thing that always kind of bothers me with this type of films: it doesn't matter how many dynamite-induced explosions take place in the middle of a pack of some 50 horses, never mind how many shots are being fired at the rabble on top of them, only the crooks get killed and the nags always go their way rejoicing in one piece. (i know...silly moi...it's just a movie...). it's not the worst western ever made, but prepare for some serious yawning.

i had high hopes for this film when i saw the listing and decided to watch it on tv, uninterrupted by commercial breaks. i've liked lee van cleef in many movies but i'm afraid that having the other characters call him chris repeatedly doesn't turn him into even a reasonable facsimile of yul brenner's chris.i found this movie to be a complete disappointment - the music sound track tried to impart the magnificence portrayed in the original but it too failed to bring the film up the the standard of the original. the rich textures of the characters in the original were mostly missing from this film. i guess if you haven't seen the original it would be okay. too many clichés and too little depth to the characters. i missed the humanity and compassion and the three dimensional characters of the original.

i really wanted to love this movie, and not only cause it had aaron eckhart in it but i thought the premise would be cool cause i enjoy movies and shows that revolves around chefs. the cinematography was good but besides it being revolved around chefs everything else is just very cliché. oh and little miss sunshine was very irritating in this movie although abigail breslin seems to be a bit irritating in every movie she is in cause she plays a lot of roles where she is whinny. it has some decent flashes of cooking, but food really didn't play a big part in the movie than i expected which was a big disappointment for me. this film had some good potential, the cast was great but they just had very little to work with. i like a good light hearted romantic comedy but this was just bland. and longer than it should be cause it felt way longer than it is. it's not a terrible movie, you just won't miss anything by not watching this movie.4.5/10

i'm really not going to waste my time with in depth analysis, i'm just going to say that i'm extremely disappointed that catherine zeta-jones made the mistake of being in the main role in this absurd, nonsense, in this full of clichés boring to death thoughtless pathetic try in film-making! there is no point in trying to find the positive sides of this movie, because as a whole it is poor in every single way, and the saddest thing is that zeta-jones is dragged so uncompromisingly into the clichés, that she has absolutely no chance of showing even 1% of her talent!avoid this movie even at the opportunity of spending the night at home starring at the wall!!!

when i saw the trailers for this movie, it looked like a good romantic comedy. i expected some light fluffy fun. instead, i was bored and a little depressed.honestly, there was no chemistry between the leads at all, and the movie had little, if anything, that was funny about it. the little girl was adorable - when she cried, i cried - but i thought they might have used someone a little bit younger in the role.either way, the movie was filled with long, dull silences or swelling opera music. i'm not anti-opera, but i would have preferred them to spend that time letting us get to know the characters, who were all stiff and underdeveloped.i was really disappointed in this movie. the whole time i watched it i kept thinking of how much better it could have been.

i ordered this movie on the internet as it is very difficult to get turkish movies where we live. i've heard so much about the tv series from my friends and practically everyone in turkey, i was expecting to see a breakthrough in turkish cinema. what a disappointment.me and my husband (who is an admirer of any movie with a bit of turkish landscape and turkish dialogues in it) only watched it all the way through because we had paid $20 for the dvd. well, that was a boring way of wasting it.it was confusing, at times overacted, whereas other times underacted. the storyline was not only confusing, but adding a gay man walking with his dog on the beach and using some toilet humor in the script to make it 'hollywood' didn't also work for me.the american characters were almost too stereotypical that it was neither funny nor realistic and like another user mentioned, the turkish customs and lifestyle was irrelevant. the camera movements had no significance. adding a few dervishes (never seen in them in kapadokya by the way) and broken plates -greek style- only made the movie even more confusing. i am ashamed of this movie and all the noise the press has made about it. there are surely worthy movies made by turkish directors which deserve more attention and respect.i give this movie 1 out of 10.

asmali konak has arguably become one of the best tv series to come out of turkey. with its unique cinematography and visual approach to filming, the series has gained a wide following base with rating records continuously broken. personally i do not agree with singers becoming actors (hence, ozcan deniz - the lead actor) but i guess the figures speak for themselves.in relation to the movie, it was disgusting to see how much someone can destroy such a plotline. years in the making, this movie was able to oversee every descent story that existed within the series. not only that, the cultural mistakes were unacceptable, with an idiotic scene involving the family members dancing (greek style) and breaking plates, which does not exists anywhere within the turkish culture.some argue the movie should be taken as a stand alone movie not as a continuation of the tv series but this theory has one major fall, the way the movie was marketed was that it will be picking up where the series left off and will conclude the series once and for all. so with that note in mind, me and everyone i know, would have asked for a refund and accepted to stand outside the theatre to warn other victims.

the real problem with this story is that there's not much story to the story. there's hardly any plot to speak of. widower buys an electric grandma for his kids. one kid resists electric grandma. then finally accepts her. then the kids grow up and grandma leaves. really, very little happens. it's much more of a premise than a story.moreover, strip it of it's schmaltz, and you have a story that had already done before, and better: the lonely. same basic idea: person initially can't accept the love of a robot, because it's just-a-machine, then eventually yields and comes to love the robot. the biggest difference is that the lonely is much more powerful, as both the protagonist and we, the audience, are shocked abruptly back to reality and forced to remember that in the end the robot really is just a mechanism.i also find the story highly flawed in that the electric grandmother is just *too* perfect. she's not only "human", she's *super-human*. she's *wiser* than a real person, she has no traces of mechanicalness to her at all, and she makes marbles appear out of thin air. it frankly really chafes at credulity to think that she's a machine.

perhaps it's just the format of this film, a documentary, but i believe that the movie would have been much better served by good actors and more solid dialogue. the fact that the actors are also the business owners is a double-edged sword. they know better than anyone else the emotions and complexities of the business they were in, but, since they are not professional actors, they do a very poor job of conveying those emotions and the documentary suffers. there were some truly memorable scenes in this movie and lots of good lines but they were delivered so poorly that they will fade away with time and the only memory i will have of this documentary is that it had some good scenes which i can't remember. watch this if you want a first-hand account of the .com bust and see what happened to the 99% of people in the industry who didn't become instant millionares. however, be prepared for some nauseating camera work, poor acting, poor dialogue, and an overall bad movie that epitomizes the era of the internet boom.

there's only one thing i'm going to say about cat in the hat...as a kids movie and a good comedy movie it sucks...i lost track of how many terrible jokes in the movie that not only sucked but weren't exactly kid appropriate. oh and by the way the way the cat in the hat talked was annoying...as for the plot i completely forgot. who cares it sucked anyway. i'm not sure why mike myers joined but i think the writers were trying to make it sound like him in austin powers without the swinger talk and it overly succeeded- but so what it was annoying. don't see it-it belongs in the bottom 100.............................. the jokes are so unkiddy it's funny

shame shame shame on ua/dw for what you do! i was appalled. do not take kids to see this movie. the humor is totally inappropriate for children - plus they'll be bored and disappointed. certainly *we all* have read theo's wonderful children book and certainly we have expectations...but this is pure trash. dr. seuss would be ashamed and certainly would've never given his "thumbs up" at such a dastardly attempt to capitalize on a classic.what a pity. spend your money on the book. if you own a copy, then buy the book and donate it to a toys for tots program. this movie is not worth a "free" ticket viewing.stick with the book. the tv cartoon version works well if you want a visual portrayal - save your money...seriously. save your money - it will be on cable by saint patty's day.shame shame shame on what they do!!

an absolutely atrocious adaptation of the wonderful children's book. crude and inappropriate humor, some scary parts, and a sickening side story about the mom's boyfriend wanting to send the boy away to military school to get him out of the way makes this totally inappropriate for the kids who will most likely want to see it because of the book (3-8) yr olds. don't waste your money, your time, or your good judgement.

most movies i can sit through easily, even if i do not particularly like the movie. i am the type of person who recognizes great films even if i do not like the genre. this is the first movie i could not stand to watch. cat in the hat is the worst movie i have ever seen--and i've seen a lot of movies. the acting is okay (myers is good as the cat, it's just that he is really annoying). the silly songs the cat sings were boring and monotonous, even for the children in the audience. the plot drags on and on, and viewers must suffer through poor dialogue. the "witty" parental remarks are disgusting, not funny (i remember some awful comment about a garden hoe being compared to, well, a type of person people call a "ho"). even though the movie is really short, it seemed to last forever. do not waste your time. i know small kids who hated this movie. if children can't stand it, i do not know how any adults can. i would like to fume more about this film but i do not even feel like wasting anymore time writing this review about it. i hated it! so, in summary, do not spend 90 minutes of your life watching this! see a good movie!1/10 stars--the lowest review i have ever given a movie.

no redeeming features, this film is rubbish. its jokes don't begin to be funny. the humour for children is pathetic, and the attempts to appeal to adults just add a tacky smuttishness to the whole miserable package. sitting through it with my children just made me uncomfortable about what might be coming next. i couldn't enjoy the film at all. although my child for whom the dvd was bought enjoyed the fact that she owned a new dvd, neither she nor her sisters expressed much interest in seeing it again, unlike with monsters inc, finding nemo, jungle book, lion king, etc. which all get frequent requests for replays.

dr. seuss would sure be mad right now if he was alive. cat in the hat proves to show how movie productions can take a classic story and turn it into a mindless pile of goop. we have mike myers as the infamous cat in the hat, big mistake! myers proves he can't act in this film. he acts like a prissy show girl with a thousand tricks up his sleeve. the kids in this movie are all right, somewhere in between the lines of dull and annoying. the story is just like the original with a couple of tweaks and like most movies based on other stories, never tweak with the original story! bringing in the evil neighbor quin was a bad idea. he is a stupid villain that would never get anywhere in life.this movie is like a rejected comic strip from the newspaper if you think about it. the film sure does look tacky! sure there are a funny adult jokes like where the cat cuts of his tail and the censor goes off before he says a naughty word, mildly funny. at least the grinch had spunk, and the film was actually good! this film is a cartoonish piece of snot with bright colors and bad mediocre acting. was mike myers even in this movie actually? and another thing, the fish. what is with that stupid fish! first time you see him, he's an actual fish. next time you see him, he's all animated and talking. but he looks like an animated piece of rubber play dough! this film is a total off target wreck. good joke, bad joke, bad, bad, bad, good joke! i'm surprised it even had good jokes like the water park ride joke, that was good. so please if you have the choice, watch the grinch instead of this mess.

spend your time any other way, even housework is better than this movie. the jokes aren't funny, the fun rhymes that are dr. seus aren't there. a very lousy way to waste an evening. my kids 4-16 laughed a little at the beginning the younger ones got bored with it and left to play barbies and the older ones left to play ps2 and surf the net. my wife left and did dishes. so i finished it alone. it was the worst "kids" movie i have seen. if you want to watch a fun kids movie watch shrek 2, that movie is fun for kids and their parents. avoid this movie. it isn't funny, isn't cute, the cat's makeup is about the only good thing in it and you can see that on the disc label.

i've seen some bad things in my time. a half dead cow trying to get out of waist high mud; a head on collision between two cars; a thousand plates smashing on a kitchen floor; human beings living like animals.but never in my life have i seen anything as bad as the cat in the hat.this film is worse than 911, worse than hitler, worse than vllad the impaler, worse than people who put kittens in microwaves.it is the most disturbing film of all time, easy.i used to think it was a joke, some elaborate joke and that mike myers was maybe a high cocaine sniffing drug addled betting junkie who lost a bet or something.i shudder

i was so looking forward to seeing this when it was in production.but it turned out to be the the biggest let down. a far cry from the whimsical world of dr seuss. it was vulgar and distasteful i don't think dr seuss would have approved.how the grinch stole christmas was much better. i understand it had some subtle adult jokes in it but my children have yet to catch on. whereas the cat in the hat screamed vulgarity they caught a lot more than i would have liked.growing up with dr seuss it really bothered me to see how this timeless classic got trashed on the big screen .lets see what they do with horton hears a who.i hope this one does dr seuss some justice.

holy cow, what a piece of sh*t this movie is. i didn't how these filmmakers could take a 250 word book and turn it into a movie. i guess they didn't know either! i don't remember any farting or belching in the book, do you?they took this all times childrens classic, added some farting, belching and sexual inuindo, and prostituted it into a kaka joke. this should give you a good idea of what these hollywood producers think like. i have to say, visually it was interesting, but the brilliant visual story is ruined by toilet humor (if you even think that kind of thing is funny) i don't want the kids that i know to think it is.don't take your kids to see, don't rent the dvd. i hope the ghost of doctor suess ghost comes and haunts the people that made this movie.

when my own child is begging me to leave the opening show of this film, i know it is bad. i wanted to claw my eyes out. i wanted to reach through the screen and slap mike myers for sacrificing the last shred of dignity he had. this is one of the few films in my life i have watched and immediately wished to "unwatch", if only it were possible. the other films being 'troll 2' and 'fast and furious', both which are better than this crap in the hat.i may drink myself to sleep tonight in a vain attempt to forget i ever witnessed this blasphemy on the good seuss name.to mike myers, i say stick with austin or even resurrect waynes world. just because it worked for jim carrey, doesn't mean seuss is a success for all canadians.

well i guess i know the answer to that question. for the money! we have been so bombarded with cat in the hat advertising and merchandise that we almost believe there has to be something good about this movie. i admit, i thought the trailers looked bad, but i still had to give it a chance. well i should have went with my instincts. it was a complete piece hollywood trash. once again proving that the average person can be programed into believing anything they say is good, must be good. aside from the insulting fact that the film is only about 80 minutes long, it obviously started with a moth eaten script. it's chock full of failed attempts at senseless humor, and awful pastel sceneries. it jumps all over the universe with no destination nor direction. this is then compounded with, ............................yes i'll say it, bad acting! i couldn't help but feel like i was watching "coffee talk" on snl every time mike myers opened his mouth. was the cat intended to be a middle aged jewish woman? spencer breslin and dakota fanning were no prize either, but mr. myers should disappear under a rock somewhere until he's ready to make another austin powers movie. f-, no stars, 0 on a scale of 1-10. save your money!

the sun was not shining, it was too wet to play, so i went to the movies, that cold, cold, wet date day."the cat in the hat" was the name of the flick, and when it was over, my stomach was sick.mike myers played the cat, his humor was lame, and kids needn't see this, the humor was not tame.the film was like drinking milk, from a rabid cow, so it is fun to have fun, yet the filmmakers didn't know how.this film, in short is atrocious. the acting was bad, the plot was tweaked too much, and the humor was surprisingly very crude.it starts with conrad and sally, a rule breaker and a future sheriff. when their mother has to go to work, she gets mrs. kwan to babysit. possibly the lone funny part in the movie is when mrs. kwan is watching a taiwanese court room, a `la c-span. she soon falls asleep, and here comes the cat.the film starts to spiral out of control. the cat came to try to let the kids have some fun. he's got thing 1 and thing 2, who suddenly start trashing the house. he improvises a tv infomercial, and accidentally slices his tail off. and when the cat goes full carmen miranda, it's not funny. possibly his only funny disguise is as a hippie activist. and there's a fish who tries warning the kids about the cat.too bad he didn't warn us this film was as much fun as sour milk, or chopping your tail off.soon the kids are outside looking for the family dog, who has the key to a crate on his collar. if the crate is not locked soon, their house will be home to the cat's universe. here it gets a little more interesting, but not enough to save the film.the acting, overall, is horrible. mike meyers brings his brand of irreverent austin powers humor to the cat, saying things like "you dirty ho" and imagining himself as a woman for the rest of his life after a whack in the testicles while posing as a pinata. spencer breslin is great as the trouble-making conrad, and dakota fanning is cute as sally, though they alone are not enough to save this horrendous aortic dissection waiting to kill john ritter(accident waiting to happen). alec baldwin's slick and slimey lawrence quinn is disgusting, ever trying to woo the kids mom, who is played by kelly preston. and sean hayes is mr. humberfloob, mom's boss, and is also the voice of the fish. the latter three are also bland.overall, if i were a parent i would not take my kids who are into potty humor, cause there's plenty of it and more. save your $7.00 and see something else. as the late great dr. seuss once said,it is fun to have fun, but you have to know how. really, universal, stop! theodore's already turning over in his grave.like my mom always says, "curiousity killed the cat".- the cat in the hat * out of *****

just about everything in this movie is wrong, wrong, wrong. take mike myers, for example. he's reached the point where you realize that his shtick hasn't changed since his snl days, over ten years ago. he's doing the same cutesy stream-of-consciousness jokes and the same voices. his cat is painfully unfunny. he tries way to hard. he's some weird type a comedian, not the cool cat he's supposed to be. the rest of the movie is just as bad. the sets are unbelievably ugly --- and clearly a waste of millions of dollars. (cardboard cut-outs for the background buildings would have made more sense than constructing an entire neighborhood and main street.) alec balwin tries to do a funny great santini impression, but he ends up looking and sounding incoherent. there's even an innapropriate cheesecake moment with faux celebrity paris hilton --- that sticks in the mind simply because this is supposed to be a dr. seuss story. avoid this movie at all costs, folks. it's not even an interesting train wreck. (i hope they'll make horton hears a who with robin williams. then we'll have the bad-seuss movie-starring-spasitc- comedian trilogy.)

there are plenty of comments already posted saying exactly how i felt about this film so ill keep it short."the grinch" i thought was marvellous - jim carrey is a truly talented, physical comedian as well as being a versatile clever actor (in my opinion). mike myers on the other hand gets his laughs by being annoying. i used to like him very much in his "waynes world" and "so i married an axe murderer" days - but ive never been fond of austin powers and "the cat in the hat" has just finished me off. this film was horrible - the gags were horrible! inappropriate for children not only in adult content but in the fact that some of them were so dated they havent amused anyone for 50 years! the plot was messy, messy, messy! its a shame really because the children were very likeable as was "mom". they probably could have picked a better villain than alec baldwin - but he could have pulled it off if it weren't for myers ugly, revolting over-acted portrayal of the cat.i mean - did myers even glance at a script? was one written? the other actors seemed to have one - but the cat just seemed to be winging it!on the other hand i would like to mention that the sets and props were marvellous!!! but unfortunately they cant save this film.poor dr seuss - the man was a genius! dont ruin his reputation by adapting his work in a such a lazy, messy way!!!1/10

bad. bad. bad. those three lines sum up this crappy little film that can only attract idiot children and their parents to the cinema. and its... #1 movie in america! what is this country thinking? mike myers looking more like micheal jackson. some chineese lady that falls asleep within 3 minutes. a lame plot with dirty jokes. it's grotesuque and awful. when green-eggs and ham comes out in 2005 i'll be so happy! (not) eddie murphy and tracy morgan will probably play two hipsters trying to find the lost green-eggs and ham. they'll try to chase sam-i-am and that mean guy who are running away with it. (i hope they don't ruin the classic book.) don't waste time and money by seeing this.

this movie has made me upset! when i think of cat in the hat. im thinking of cat in the hat books. you know, the one from a few years back that parents read to thier children. well, i though that this movie would be a lot like that! but much to my suprise was nothing like the books! insted it is more like young adult humor movie. in one part cat is talking to a gardening tool (hoe) cat talks to it like it is his hoe (agin adult humor). the naming of his car i all so though was a little untastful for a kids movie. under the rating you'll find: mild cude humor and some double-entendres. i think in short this means adult humor. i wish i could return this movie! wal-mart said they wouldn't because the movie has been opened. if you are thinking about buying this i suggest that maybe rent before you buy.

the cat in the hat is just a slap in the face film. mike myers as the cat in the hat is downright not funny and mike myers could not have been any worse. this is his worst film he has ever been in. the acting and the story was just terrible. i mean how could they make the most beloved stories by dr. seuss be made into film and being one of the worst films of all-time and such a disappointment. i couldn't have seen a more worst film than this besides, maybe baby geniuses. but this film is just so bad i can't even describe how badly they made this film. bo welch should be fired or the writer should. hedeen's outlook: 0/10 no stars f

inappropriate. the pg rating that this movie gets is yet another huge misstep by the mpaa. whale rider gets a pg-13 but this movie gets a pg? please. parents don't be fooled, taking an elementary school child to this movie is a huge mistake. there were numerous times i found myself being uncomfortable not just because the humor was inappropriate for kids, but also because it was totally out of the blue and unnecessary.but all that aside, the cat in the hat is still a terrible movie. the casting and overall look of the movie are the only saving graces. the beautiful kelly preston and the always likeable (or hateable in this case) alec baldwin are both good in their roles even though preston is almost too beautiful for a role like this. the kids are conditioned actors and it shows, especially with dakota fanning. fanning is the only human aspect of the film that kept me watching and not throwing things at the screen.did i mention there was an oversized talking cat in this movie? mike myers is absolutely deplorable. i didn't like him as the voice of shrek, and i truly believe now that myers should not be allowed near the realm of children's films ever again. his portrayal of the cat is a slightly toned down version of fat bastard and austin powers.in the end, the cat should not have come, he should have stayed away, but he came, even if just for a day, he ruined 82 minutes of my life, 82 minutes of personal anger and strife.the cat in the hat may be the worst kids movie ever.

mean spirited, and down right degrading adaptation to the classic children's tale not only lacks the charm of its forefather but lacks any talent what so ever. mike myers should not only be ashamed of himself for his horrible performance that is a clear rip off of what jim carrey did but he should give up acting all together. he is so annoying that you would want to beat the crap out of him if you were able to jump right in the film. the sets are ugly and the cinematography is very poor. i have seen a lot of bad film this year, but this not only takes the cake but it is with out a doubt one the worse films ever made.

well the previews looked funny and i usually don't go to movies on opening night especially with my kids because ......well you never know. here is a movie that doesn't appeal either to children or adults as the jokes are too perverse for children and falls completely flat for entertainment purposes for adults. i was actually embarrassed to be with my 9 and 6 year old and having to explain to my 6 year old what s h * t spells. essentially what happens here is a total twisting of dr. seuss's classic. it adds an evil and lazy neighbor who wants to marry the children's mother for her money. if that was a subplot, then maybe that would have been fine but it ends up being the major plot around the whole movie and "the cat" plays more of a subplot role in exposing the neighbor to the mom for who he really is. take my advice and read the book and pass on the movie.

from the acting, direction, scriptwriting and art direction this film is just entirely ill conceived and the money would have been better spent on shoes for land mine victims. when did we get so sad that they have to fill a a children's movie with sexual innuendo to keep the parents attention.dr suess is rolling in his grave right now, what with the "dirty ho" "s.h.i.t" and fake erection scenes etc etc etc. its shameful how they trade on the name of suess to get the parents to bring their kids, throw in the profanities to try for the teens and a few sad parents who won't watch a a film with their child if there is no t & a. greed greed and more greed.compare this to the classic children's films and we can get a disturbing view of world is turning into. these guys should stick to making mtv videos. how on earth this movie got >400 votes as a perfect 10 is beyond me. (unless its the directors family)

this movie was physically painful to sit through, maybe because (like many people my age, and younger) i grew up with dr. seuss and loved his books - funny, clever, whimsical and subversive at the same time. "the cat in the hat" sucks all of the interest and spark out of the story, and mike myer's performance as the cat is mostly bewildering. why the borscht belt accent, the unfunny patter, the inappropriate jokes, the charmless costume? i had to go back and re-read the books to see the real problem: the books are simple. this movie is overblown and way, way too long.you don't expect every kids' movie to be toy story or the iron giant, but this one set a new low. how could mike myers need the money?

if you liked the grinch movie... go watch that again, because this was no where near as good a seussian movie translation. mike myers' cat is probably the most annoying character to "grace" the screen in recent times. his voice/accent is terrible and he laughs at his own jokes with an awful weasing sound, which is about the only laughing i heard at the theater. not even the kids liked this one folks, and kids laugh at anything now. save your money and go see looney tunes: back in action if you're really looking for a fun holiday family movie.

the only good thing about this unfunny dreck is that i didn't have to pay for it. i saw it for free at college. and if a college student can't find humor in something that was free, it's hopeless.stale acting and poor jokes cannot be masked by an excellent, yet bewildering set design (that goes out of its way to market volkswagon beetles). i don't know what michaels myers was doing in this movie, but i have never seen anything more depressing. this was nothing more than a blatant effort to capitalize on the previous success of the grinch (which has its opponents, but i enjoyed it very much). it's difficult not to sit through this failure and wonder what better projects were passed over to fund it.you want a funny seuss adaptation? go with the grinch.

audrey, i know you truly cherish your husband ted's memory but please do his legacy justice and heed his wishes. dr. seuss refused to license his characters during his lifetime for a very good reason. we beg of you to please stop cashing in on his stories, images, fantasies and characters. they are getting disemboweled by the powers that be of hollywood and broadway. the children of tomorrow will be stuck with these histrionic and grotesque interpretations that will forever pollute the loving warmth and innocence of his books.it is indeed your property to do with as you wish. i just wish you would listen to the advice of others for a little while. save what is left of dr. seuss. thank you.

oh but this is woeful. one good actor after another turns in lamentable dialogue in half hearted fashion under what must have been incredibly pedestrian direction to consider it acceptable. i like robert carlyle and joanne whalley is one of my favourite actresses, tom courtney can act well when pushed and david suchet is a professional of the highest integrity but they all wallowed around like fish in a barrel of watery gin. i swear courtney was inebriated, on painkillers or both. was there a good performance in the whole thing? well yes, david hood as the junior underground engineer whose mate got washed away looked like he was taking the thing seriously and credit to him for that, it can't be easy when "all around are losing theirs" so to speak, or maybe his scenes came under the direction of the assistant director ( if there was one) i just don't know what these people were doing in a film that was this poor ( other than paying the bills, obviously) i can't begin to say how disappointed i am in them. you should be ashamed of yourselves! any positives other than david hood the third... yes the aerial shots of london largely submerged were very well done and the effects artists responsible deserved better than to have their fine work punctuated by such a shallow story,if you'll forgive the expression, as those few people that do see them will do so on a far smaller screen than would be to best advantage. what's going on here? why are british film makers trying to imitate such characterless, spectacle driven, tabloid level genres as the disaster movie and then doing it even worse than the americans. gritty realism, character integrity, the capture of real emotion in a way that makes you feel it and care... the family way, spring and port wine, get carter, the long good friday, trainspotting....don't get me wrong i like a bit of escapist hokum. the real "italian job" , the adventures of tom jones; but oh that it should come to this, there was more realistic drama in carry on camping.

there's something intriguing about disaster movies. the simple, primal premise can lead to several great stories. granted, most disaster movies tend to explore familiar territory instead but i can usually live with that.unfortunately, flood probably marks the low point in the history of this sub-genre. robert carlyle is undoubtedly the star of the movie, even though screen time is split between different locations and characters. he gives a barely decent performance. as well, joanne whalley is very uneven. veteran actor tom courtenay (he played in doctor zhivago for heaven's sake) is particularly bad. i mean, his timing is completely off most of the time and his characterization is extremely poor. what an embarrassing performance for that man. the rest of the cast ranges from decent to really bad with one exception: jessalyn gilsig, whom i thought might be there as a plot device/eye candy gives by far the most convincing performance. doesn't mean much considering how bad everybody else is but still nice to see that she cared.the script is really bad, confusing and cliché. some of the worse lines i have heard in quite some time are delivered by the actors one after the other.you've seen this story a thousand times. it employs every dramatic hook and tear-jerkers you've seen in "outbreak", "armageddon", the poseidon movies (original and remake) and many others.the direction is awful. no sense of timing, nothing inspired. the shots are bland, dialog and action both fail to flow. editing is bad but how do you edit such a mess? without a doubt, this movie tried to rely way too much on (rather poor) cgi. the human factor, the drama and struggles of the characters are glossed over. scenes where the characters must actually face the flood are rare and poorly done. the made-for-tv feel gives nausea. some guy is supposed to go down a rope from an helicopter? no problem, let's show him inside a helicopter and make a really poor cut/editing job and have the next frame with him safely on the ground, in the most obvious way possible.the movie score is rather poor. all over the place, no timing.the ending is probably the worse i have seen in quite some time. very much like they ran out of ideas. scrap that, you can't run out of something if you never had it in the first place. must have ran out of budget.this is a really amateur job. i give it a 2 for using london as a location, which is a nice change, for gilsig being actually decent in a key support role and for the few cgi shots that were decent (those of the water closing in on london and the gates).do yourself a favor and check out day after tomorrow or just about any disaster movie before this one. this includes older classics like the towering inferno.

the first 1/3 of this movie i loved and thought it was going to be one of truffaut's best films. i loved the plot where a pen pal marries a man from half way around the world--sight unseen. especially when this woman turns out to be a fraud and was responsible for the death of the real pen pal so she could take her place! she then cleaned out the husband's huge bank account and disappeared! i was really hooked and wanted to see more,...and then, the movie fell apart and became just plain dumb! despite her coming from new caladonia (an island in the pacific) and he from reunion (an island in the indian ocean), when he goes on a trip to the south of france, he stumbles upon her almost immediately. hmm,....odds are 187,000,000 to 1 but he finds her. then, instead of either killing her or turning her over to the police, he forgives her--even when she acknowledges what she has done. okay--this is tough to believe, but okay,...but then he helps to hide her from a private detective by murdering him!!!! no one is that stupid! yes, the character catherine deneuve plays is quite beautiful but come on folks--this is just silly. plus, if he only wanted her as a sex object, then why would he do this for a woman who is often frigid and completely selfish and evil.this movie, due to it's very ridiculous plot, does not deserve such high ratings! unless you are a die-hard truffaut fan, try another film--even one of truffaut's--just not this one.

i'm trying to find something of value here. the best i can muster is that truffaut wanted to make a movie as tedious, painful, puerile, annoying, illogical, and brainless as the experience of being in love. if that was his goal, then he succeeded, but the solution to his exercise is really a drag to watch.there is one scene that screams for a spoof: belmondo compares the features of deneuve's face to the features in a landscape . all i could think the whole time was "glacier," "ice floe," "two lonely fishermen wearing army surplus on a frozen lake in minnesota."the only other point of interest was the resurrection of buffoon's theory of climatic determinism. the tropics are presented as paradise, and things get progressively worse as they get colder, hell being calvinist french switzerland. that was kind of funny.

when i was young, i'd get up early every saturday morning not to watch cartoons but to turn on the local channel for what was called 'kung fu theatre.' it wasn't as if these films were works of art. it wasn't as if these films all came from china, japan, korea, or any country in particular; if the story had to do with fighting  be it swordplay or fisticuffs  and if the fighting didn't resemble much of anything going on in any american gym class, then that was good enough. it wasn't as if they were really even very good. they were just great action flicks with incredibly over-dramatic music where the hero reaped his vengeance over a whole host of bad guys, and then the credits would roll."sword in the moon" is much like these films of my youth, arguably a bit of a thematic throwback given a welcome twist by muddying the characters up enough that it becomes increasingly difficult to tell the bad guys from the good.yun (cho jae hyun) is known throughout the kingdom as 'the human butcher.' he kills quickly and mercilessly on behalf of the chun dynasty, the chief bodyguard of an emperor who spared his life and the life of his men in exchange for his service. however, an equally merciless rebel and his lovely sidekick appear in the countryside and start murdering imperial ministers, and yun agrees to find these rebels and kill them. his task becomes one of personal discovery when he learns that the two rebels are choi (a friend from his past) and his former love, shi yeong.sadly, "sword" doesn't have much to distinguish itself from other action films. some stunning cinematography is nearly entirely wasted on shoddy editing with portions of the film put together so loosely its hard to believe that what inevitably made it to the film was what anyone intended. while the atmosphere and story tend to gravitate toward a dark mood, the tone is almost sacrificed to the never-ending parade of flashbacks as each of the main characters is given a healthy story arc. what should've been a quick and easy action film gets weighed down by far too much personal baggage, and the film suffers as a result.i've read that this film marks korea's first real foray into the world of art-house action pieces along the likes of "crouching tiger, hidden dragon." next time, i'd strongly suggest that the producers stick with a little more 'martial' and a little less 'art.'

the success of the original french "emmanuelle" series (i've only watched the first, which wasn't too bad considering) led to a spate of imitations; the italian counterpart, which even changed the race of its heroine, was clearly less polished and more exploitative - descending more and more into vulgarity as the series went along. incredibly, there were 16 "black emanuelle" films in total, with the heroine even having the spelling of her name changed to avoid copyright issues!! still, laura gemser - the titular object of desire - became almost as much of an icon as the original emmanuelle, sylvia kristel (although, personally, she's too skinny for my tastes)! here she's even billed as "emanuelle" rather than with her real name - with the director, likewise, becoming "albert thomas"! in itself, the film offers little of interest: as a matter of fact, one would do best to approach it as a travelogue with some decent footage of the african wildlife. with respect to the sex scenes, i don't know how complete the version i watched was but, while there was a lot of nudity, none of it was very explicit - or even titillating (the scene that came closest, perhaps, was when gemser - who works as a photographer - and her companion karin schubert turn the camera on each other, naturally sans clothes, in the middle of the jungle)! the film also features an artist made up to look like salvador dali but, mercifully perhaps, his scenes do not take much of the running time. the score by nico fidenco is typically bland 70s pop and, really, nothing to write home about.

her bit-part as a masseuse, in the lurid sequel to the original 'emmannuelle', evidently gave someone the bright idea of putting a spanner in the works of the french soft-core series' gambit by inverting the caucasian carnality and casting javan stunner gemser in a leading role in this, the rather tame first of a series of sexploiters that became increasingly depraved as sleazier directors took on in-name-only sequels.someone (and surely not the english-language over-haulers warner?) was also anticipating an 'a star is born' type meteoric rise out the results, judging by the way the actress is credited merely with the eponymous moniker of the on-screen heroine, albeit with a couple of consonants sacrificed as insurance against litigation.gemser's tenure in the series saw her as an 'intrepid' photographer, allowing of course for all manner of subsequent globe-trotting adventures. but, whilst she may well have been one the very most beautiful actresses on the screen at that time, any thespian talent that may have been there to discern becomes mired in the same sort of unfeasibly facile cogitation ("i have to confess that since i've been in africa, i find white skin less appealing...") that was to be found in the french films.and in this particular entry, much to the consternation of the raincoat brigade the essence of on-screen carnality is as much to be found in puerile symbolism (pumping engine pistons!) as it is in prosaic couplings - although naturally these include generous dollops of 'exploratory' lesbianism. connoiseurs of kitsch are however guaranteed a continuous stream of aural delights, what with such epithets of ethnographic wisdom as "i do nothing to be a perfect black, she does everything to be a perfect white".

this movie is over hyped!! i am sad to say that i manage to watch the first 15 minutes of this movie and anything beyond that, i will have to force myself real hard to sit down and watch the rest of the movie. it's totally stupid and very fake. the robot in the movie looks like a man wearing those steel suit and the acting is really bad especially the one playing the character alien.he is totally annoying!! don't waste your money watching this sequel to the popular gen-x cops. i'd rather sleep or spend my money on some other things rather than watching this movie. 1 out of 10. if possible,i'd give 0.

i saw this movie on vhs some time ago (27 jan 2003), just because of the name of paul rudd on the cover. i liked his performance in `the object of my affection' very much and i really expected a good work. however, i found this film a complete mess. the story has a very confused screenplay and the characters are not well developed. further, the low-budget special effects do not help much. i do not know the previous generation of gen-y cops, but this next generation is not good. i do not recall exactly why i gave this grade (and i do not intent to see this movie again), but my vote is four.title (brazil) : `gen-y cops a nova geração' (`gen-y cops the next generation')

i somehow managed to make it all the way through this movie, but was dumbfounded by the complete lack of entertainment delivered. my friends and i are fans of hk film, but wow. this movie has it all, and by all i mean everything a movie shouldn't have. underdeveloped and stereotyped characters, way over-the-top overacting, cheesy special effects, talking robots, no less than 20 double-foot jumpkicks, impossible situations, unfunny "gags" and "jokes", elementary school premise, mindless killings, and too-long running time for the material. throw in the fact that gen-x cops was a decent film and this movie becomes even harder to bear. quite simply, if you're entertaining the idea of watching this film...don't.

this film is really a big piece of trash trying to make itself look like a hollywood production.poor story outline(stupid robot story)...ultra bad acting by untalented pop idols...and they are trying to"fight"!!!my goodness...those miserable actors uses wires to make them look like they are "good fighters"...:(and i hate that arrogant edison chen...the worst actor i have ever seen!!!i will never touch his movies again.avoid this movie at all costs!!!i wanted to give it a negative value out of ten...not even worth a 0/10.

exceptionally silly actioner with braindead leads in a story which would have suited a fill-in issue of spiderman. the action sequences never really flow as they should, leaving some cool bits orphaned in a sea of sound and fury, signifying nothing. i really wonder how they'll release this one in the west. sam lee overacts like crazy, newcomer edison chan doesn't display any acting talent yet. the robot is clunky and not very impressive, and the cgi effects (though done by us sfx-people) are ridiculous, totally destroying any remaining suspension of disbelief. i am not looking forward to gen-z cops...

i recently waisted 8  by going and see this movie in the cinema. it was a waste of time and the only feeling you get going out of the theater is a slightly nauseous of all the disgusting social pornography. it could have been interesting if it had a quite absurd twist but it hadn't so it was just plain awful with maybe one or two scenes which could have been taken out and made to very nice short movies.another thing i thought about is the way the director uses all the finish stereotypes as characters. it is quite extraordinary how you as a finish director can make a movie with the worst stereotypes of your own nationality. it was sad to sit and and hear the audience sitting and laughing at things that they thought was typical finish but in general just is making fun of people.

if this is what's best in the finnish cinema at the moment, i'd say those big tax euros spent at supporting "culture" have gone to waste here in a horrible way. paha maa is the worst kind of example of trying to make a finnish "european film" for big audiences. i'm sure they wanted it to be all state-of-the-art, smart and touching at the same time. the result is crap.to make it short: - the story is pretentious, naïve and not credible. the same goes for the characters. i can imagine them brainstorming about making a film where "everything would, like, turn to ***t and people would be hurt and feel, you know, really bad inside, because finnish people are so notoriously depressed, too, and their self-esteem is so bad", which brings us to the fact that...- the film is loaded with clichés, mostly about "the finnish mentality". the way the it deals with people's problems and their causes could be straight out of a regular women's magazine or a cheap bull-psychology-self-help book. ("we feel so bad inside!") i'm sure they watched some kaurismäki, too, to find out what it is about his films that people like, misunderstood him completely, and came up with a boring, depressing story about people going through all kinds of s**t for no other artistic purpose than perhaps social pornography. it's a crying shame they threw in tolstoy here. it's just a sign of trying to be smart. and of not being.- i think the worst fault, however, is the complete lack of vision and depth. the film is highly unoriginal. it is also frustrating to watch endless sulking and suffering without any real revelation brought to it. i can go through this kind of mind**ck if the film is funny or ends up being an elaborate joke, or better yet, something sublime like in e.g. von trier's breaking the waves. there was none these in paha maa. actually though, i did start laughing at some point because the turn of events was again just too predictable, over-the-top and incredible.who does this crap? and who likes it? i hope they're pretending.

let's see. this movie is many things to different people. to finns, as shown by the comments, it can be ok or dreadful or boring. to other folks, it can be something different. first off: if you do not speak finnish (i do), you will understand half of what is going on, as subtitles are dreadful and even the title is translated incorrectly ("paha maa" would probably be idiomatically translated as badlands in uk english).why did i not like it? because it is a tarantino-style movie: it simply takes a very harsh reality and throws it back at you, as brutally as possible. i, however, am not american, and thus i am not particularly fond of this proceeding, because all it does is show that the director has really nothing new to say. technical prowess (camera work is brilliant), script (not that unoriginal) do not rescue this movie from the bottom where it belongs. should you wish to see a finnish movie, then go for any of the kaurismäki brothers' movie, who match talent and directorial skill, with very good actresses and actors. this director ought to review his intention and priorities: none was intelligible, and thus this film failed. by not watching it you won't miss much.

when you make a film with a killer-kids premise, there are two effective ways to approach it; you can either make it as realistic as possible, creating believable characters and situations, or you can make it as fun as possible by playing it for laughs (something which the makers of "silent night, deadly night" did, for example, on an equally controversial subject: a killer santa). the people who made "bloody birthday", however, do neither of those things; they simply rely on the shock value of the image of a kid with a gun (or a knife, or a noose, or an arrow) in his/her hand. the result is both offensive and stupid. the whole film looks like a bad idea that was rushed through production (and then kept from release for several years). it's redeemed a tiny bit by good performances from the kids, but it's very sloppily made. (*1/2)

when people say children are annoying u think ya my little cousins can be annoying and i said little. these children are turning 10 and they are without a doubt the most annoying bratty children you will ever encounter (in a film). lets start with the blonde - debbie - she's a slut of a girl, i mean come on she wears mini skirts, she has stupid frizzy blonde hair and a freckley red bunny like face. she acts so innocent. next we have the second child - the geek - who thinks he's so cool, with his long range shooting and his use of a silencer (a coat over the gun) and most of all his evil bratty smile. the next kid is the quiet one you don't care about so thats all on him. this film angered me at the children's intelligence and the only enjoyment i got was from my cousin who kept bitching about them.

oh boy ! it was just a dream ! what a great idea ! mr lynch is very lucky most people try to tell classical stories. this way he can play with his little plantings and his even more little payoffs. check out polanski's "the lodger" for far more intelligent mix of fantasy and reality.

i thrive on cinema....but there is a limit. a name isn't enough to make a movie!. the beginning of the movie puts us in a mood to expect the unseen yet. but we remain hungry ( or angry..) till the end . things are getting so confused that i admit that i did not understand the end or was there an end to this nonesense. the opportunity to make an outstanding movie was there but the target was totally missed. next...

there is an inherent problem with commenting or reviewing a film such as this. i remember feeling the same way after disliking dogma. if you do not like a film that is odd and controversial like mulholland dr., you are seen as "not getting it." of course for those who have already seen this film you know that the entire point is not getting it anyway.i have heard from several different sources that the unique and likable aspect of this film is a dream-like quality it has. in other words, the plot isn't structured like other films. with the case of mulholland dr., it seems more like an unfocused collage made by a third grade boy who procrastinated until the last second to do his art project. it doesn't make sense, it isn't supposed to, but i know it was to be a tv series at first. it appears lynch had a stack of unused film and decided to mash it in with a bunch of new stuff. you will notice that toward the end the nudity, sex and foul language increase. all things he would not have filmed for television.for a better film not told in a traditional, linear fashion, rent the thin red line from 1998. that was a great film, this is not.rating: 2 out of ten

ok we have a film that some are calling one of the best movies ever..but i'm sitting here thinking hell the f!, the storys sux{ which there is no story], the diolouge is quite plain, artisticly nothing great!, and the acting is nothing real out standing, so if you want to pretend to be arty say you like it, but if you have a real view say you don't like it or if you did explain why!

how much longer are we to persist with this flawed belief that once a director produces great, ground-breaking work, all future work "can't be all that bad, after all, he made such-and-such".mulholland drive is a case in point, and is in fact unmitigated rubbish. the performances are excellent, particularly from watts and theroux, but a good film they do not necessarily make. what lynch has clearly forgotten is that just making a film unnecessarily wierd only works when it takes the audience by surprise. when the audience is expecting the film to not make sense, then the film has to have some substance to keep the audience interested. lynch succeeds in the first half of the film, with the murder-mystery set up with lots of twists and red herrings, and then ... plop! the story decends into a quagmire of bizarre halucinations and pointless segues. methinks lynch realised how muddled the film was becoming, and threw in the lesbian and mastobatory scenes to the audience awake, and to stop the male viewers from standing up and leaving.watching the film at the preview, i was surrounded by lynchophiles who had no more idea of what was going on than i did, but left the theatre commenting on the "layers and layers" of lynch's film-making. excuse me but these people are the same nitwits who stand in art galleries staring at canvasses that have been painted white commenting on the "courage of the artist at painting such a brave work".films like these are made because (a) lynch is trading on his previous work; and (b) because people convince themselves that unintelligeable film is art, and therefore, must be good. i queried a number of the lynchophiles about what they actually liked in the film and only response i recieved that wasn't a broad "layers" type of answer was that they liked it when the "chicks got their kit off".nuff said.

seriously, if i wanted to make a movie that makes zero sense, never will, and features lesbian scenes as its only high-point, i could have.david lynch is the worst, as is this movie. anyone could have made a better movie in which at least some answers were given and the story wasn't so slow and long-winded. the story means nothing without something at the end besides the credits. what a waste of time. i will never get those 147 minutes of my life back and hope that others can learn from my mistake.

how does david lynch do it? unlike the legions of thick-black-framed-glasses-wearing types and pretentious movie critics who praise his name, i just don't see how this guy keeps getting paid to make such tripe. how can lynch sloppily cobble together leftover footage from a failed tv pilot into a nonsensical, poorly-acted mess & have critics rave about it & actually include it on year's best lists?i'm baffled. if you're looking for a good film noir, rent "bound" instead. if you're looking for a good "puzzle" movie try "memento." but beware of this over-hyped stinker unless your idea of a fun night is throwing away 2 1/2 hours of your life & $3.50 of your hard-earned cash.

some directors take 2 and a half hours to tell a story, david lynch takes 2 and a half hours to piece together scenes with "clues" and his trademark oddity, but there's never a story. no plot. no progression of the characters (unless you find revealed delusion a "progression"). it amazes me how anyone can call lynch's garbage "art", but if beauty rests in the eye of the beholder, so be it. lynch's movie and tv work in the 1980's came off as "avant garde" and "alternative", fine. 20 years later, work like "mulholland drive" comes off as a 2.5 hour david lynch masturbation piece. it's embarrasing. i've finally seen the movie that takes my top spot as the worst ever. at least the people churning out "godzilla" and "rodan" weren't passing them off as "art".

i get the feeling a lot of people liked this movie (not all people, but a lot of them) because they don't want to admit they don't understand it. people of middling intelligence, if you will, who pretend to be ever so avant garde and trendy who think lynch is a genius.lynch, to me, is like tarantino. they're both great, but neither one is the messiah as so many fanboys want to believe. no director can change the world, so chill out. and both make sucky flicks sometimes, it just happens. everyone has a bad day. and clearly, since this movie was actually designed as a pilot first and then hack-jobbed into a feature film, it wasn't made with all the passion and forethought one should put into a movie. face it, much of the movie is gibbering unintelligibility which cannot be understood. we can all make up meanings, lynch may have his own view, but none of that matters. it was strewn about the screen incoherently. admittedly, the first portion had the semblance of an intentionally convoluted passingly interesting story, but then it falters.the cowboy, the mysterious organization of men with their phonecalls, the lawyers... come on. i can almost picture david lynch yelling cut, forcing the crew to gather around him and explaining to them all "look how crazy and weird i am! isn't it great?? it's so weird and crazy!" weird and crazy works if it's a by-product of your style. however, it's pretentious and tired when you go out of your way to do nothing but that. it's like all those half assed pulp fiction throw backs that came out after pulp fiction. it's just not cool.

it´s a joke, right?! lynch could not get produced this as a tv show. he was out of money, so what to do? well, he received somehow some dollars and "completed" the pilot and created this mess by just mixing everything together... how can anybody see a failed pilot for tv as an cinematic masterpiece?!and now everybody is guessing about the deeper meaning!? well, wake up, there is none! like in that other tv series by lynch, what was the name again? same procedure there. build up a mystery and then come up with nothing. i guess lynch will repeat this concept until people will realise, the emperor has no clothes. in germany there is a comedian called harpe kerkerling. he dressed up as an opera singer and "performed" some new "art songs". singing complete nonsense like this: "the wolf. the lamb. on the meadow. hurrz!" it´s a classic now. anyway, afterwards he discussed it with the audience. and they were talking seriously about the deeper meaning of the wolf / lamb relationship.you people giving this movie a rating of 8.0 in imdb.com, you people could be one of them. so let´s say it all together: "hurrz!"0/10 macaulay j. connor

if you are a pretentious person, it would sound like a good idea to brag about your intellectuality saying that you really like this movie.otherwise, don't bother and better watch something good.this is the stereotypical movie for snobs. the plot line would be very silly if you could see it from beginning to end. it is just presented in a messed up way as an attempt to make it hard to understand and make the movie look intellectual.mullholland drive is not enjoyable to watch. you would very rarely understand anything the first time you see it. and if you do, you would most likely be disappointed because it is not a big deal.

like most, i rented this after i heard the universal praise. and despite countless bizarre, unexplainable moments along the way, i was very interested and entertained through 100 minutes of the film. then the two women went to the "performance" late at night. the rest of movie (which is another 40 minutes by the way) is even weirder than the first part and completely contradict and dump on what i had already seen. then the movie abruptly ends.baffled, i wandered over to my computer to see if i could buy a clue as to what just happened. nothing made sense, and i'm a pretty clever guy. none of these other user comments made sense, even when they say "spoilers." i still have no idea what they're saying. someone's dream? not real? then what's the point of a 2 hour 30 minute movie if it's "not real?" or is it real? i'm forced to make a choice. either:[a] the movie is a work of genius on a mensa level and i'm simply too stupid to understand it.[b] the movie is weird for weird's sake and just doesn't make sense. everyone who loves it is trying to save face and pretend like they "get" it.i choose [b]. screw you guys, i'm going home...

to me this film is just a very very lame teen party movie with all the normal clichés and boring stereotyped characters (nerds, jocks, popular girls, sleezy guys, etc) but with an underlying anti drug/drinking theme. if you ever have the unfortunate chance of seeing this film, keep an eye out for all the references to responsibility and keeping it real (dunno how else to word it) i guess the only thing that'd make this film cool, would be if they tv playing it was on fire. that, or dvd it was on exploded...1 out of 10000 - watch animal house instead.

schoolies is a pointless exercise... go to gold coast, get drunk and have sex. worthwhile ambitions maybe but not highly intellectual. the plot is a simple as a few sentences assigned to each character and nobody is helped by the cliches doled out here.something that would help is the casting. everybody looks too old. these characters are supposedly innocents embarking out on their own in faltering steps to adulthood yet they all look way too old to be believable in the role.

i watched this film on telly the other night and little did i know what a cringe-fest it would be...i knew it would be stupid but not this bad! this film exemplifies everything that is awful in australian comedy. apart from the most tedious, uninspired scenarios and characters i have ever come across (aside from those dubious french produced american tax break comedies!), most of the situations were boring, unbelievable, stereotypical and so not funny just...terrible! one such scenario that really annoyed me was the nerds on the bus scene. from a screen writing perspective the writers used the most uninteresting - not to mention unbelievable - scenario to get these three stranded without their luggage...they are on the holiday of their lives and they're going to risk it all (including a $300 deposit, luggage and room) to exert their rights to dance on a bus? i mean, they're about half an hour away from their destination! at least they could have had the bus driver kick them off but, no they leave willingly cos 'they can't take it anymore!'and wreck their holiday...anyway, i can't believe the writers didn't workshop this appalling scenario out. i think a ten year old could come up with 5 set-ups more clever, funny and believable.i can go on with many others - the really unimaginative stereotypical psychopath, the whole relationship with the angry jilted girlfriend and tag along virgin, the 'wow man! out there goth girl' inhaling stuff on the train - everything was just woeful! i cannot think of one redeeming feature of the this film except that maybe the third wheel nerd was kind of cute. spoilt his career by appearing in this trash though!

mediocre at best. slow, but probably more entertaining to the younger viewers. a young boy(chris miller) is haunted by an indian spirit and horrid monster in the cellar of his father's new home. also in the cast are patrick kilpatrick, suzanne savoy and ford rainey.

if you can get past the slow start and bad acting it's worth watching. the story line was pretty decent. the father had a wicked temper because he was unemployed and he hardly got to see his kid except in the summer because his ex-wife had custody of him. the father was very angry and frustrated the majority of the time. the monster in the story wasn't too scary. the movie breaks consistency of the monster being so incredibly strong. the one scene that the moviemakers do this in is one of the times when the kid is down in the cellar and the monster goes to attack him. when the monster goes to attack the kid his arm gets caught in a steel trap attached to a chain. the monster is about a foot away from the kid's face. every other time throughout the movie the monster is strong enough to break through or tear down anything. yet the steel trap and chain holds him back from getting the kid! more than likely the moviemakers did this for shock factor because no one wants to see one of the main characters die. moviemakers just wanted to scare us into thinking it may be a possibility that the kid could die. instead of breaking consistency, the moviemakers should have replaced the kid with someone who they could dispose of!

"the cellar" is an intolerably dull and overly child-friendly 80's cheese parade, directed by kevin tenney (creator of the much better films "witchboard" and "night of the demons") and starring the incredibly untalented patrick kilpatrick, supposedly depicting a guy with feelings. the pacing is really slow, the plot feels far too familiar, the monster-effects are all but petrifying and the film opens and ends with tedious narrative ranting that somehow feels unrelated to the actual subject matter of the film. the voice-over keeps on nagging about wind and creatures riding on wind, but what the hell, there's no wind in the plot? like so many 80's horror movies, "the cellar" handles about cursed indian landscapes and all-too-real mythical monsters hidden in basements and quagmires. mance cashen and his family move into a house build on what once was the home of native americans, but then white people came and turned the land into oil fields. half of the script is wasted on explaining the origin of the monster, but i can easily summarize it for you: an ancient indian witchdoctor summoned the creature (which looks like an over-sized paper-mâché rat) to annihilate the white people overflowing his land but he buried it again because, and i quote, the sob kills indians as well. mance's hugely irritating son accidentally awakens the beast and naturally can't convince his parents about the big hungry rat in the cellar. the allegedly emotional family situation (daddy constantly wants his son to love him) is very pathetic and redundant and the film badly needed more bloodshed; kids' movie or not. the youthful hero (chris miller) is quite annoying, but we've definitely seen worse kid actors in the 80's. "the cellar" is very much not recommended, unless of course you're a fan of cheesy and typically 80's monster designs. the big dodgy rat-thing is a real hoot to see.

a few years ago i bought a movie called the cellar. i had heard that it was supposed to be a great movie, but it turned out that it was a flop and a b-movie.the story is good, but there are no good effects in the movie. (maybe they didn't have enough money for that on the budget???).if you choose to watch this movie be sure to watch it three times. the first, only and last time!!!

regardless of what anyone says, its a b-movie, and the effects are poorly done.. if you're a vampire fanatic, i suppose it would be ok, not 10 out of 10, you others here cant sincerely mean that?. we are to view this as a movie, not read it as a book, so the effects and characters are important, as well as the story. the story are good, but it doesn't carry the film, no wonder it has a low rating over all. i write this because i chose to see this movie when i saw some good reviews here on imdb, but got severely disappointed. don't get me wrong, i thought the blade movies was awesome, and loved the underworld movies, but this characters aren't close. the make up on the vampires is poorly done, and the effects are worse. this sucks. i might not have gotten so disappointed if i had not read reviews here that told me how great it was. the reviewers must have had something to do with the production company or something, seriously, if you think this is awesome, you don't care about acting or make up. this is better as a book. 3 out of 10 for an ok story..

first of all, let me make it clear. this movie is a real piece of garbage, but although it is a real piece of garbage, it is an better piece of garbage than it could have been. it could have sucked big-time, but it doesn't...what this movie didn't have, was for example scary moments, good acting and a good script. it wasn't very entertaining either. but the movie had cool music, fancy locations and hot girls. it also works great as a dracula spoof. (hope it was meant that way, although i really don't think so)the story focuses on three girls in transylvania, awaking an ancient vampire, which then terrorizes and kills the girls, one by one. sounds familiar? yes, so it does!after reading through this, you may think that i should have given it a better vote. the reason i don't, is because i almost felt asleep at some points...

subspecies is set in romania where two american college students michele (laura mae tate) & lillian (michelle mcbride) arrive to study local folklore with the aid of local friend mara (irina movila). there they rent rooms in a hotel & become curious about the mysterious ruins of a nearby castle, it turns out that a powerful & evil vampire named radu (anders hove) lives there who has stolen the bloodstone from his father king vladislav (angus scrimm). radu takes a fancy to the three girls & starts drinking the blood of mara & lillian, meanwhile michele falls for a guy named stefan (michael watson) who just so happens to be radu's brother. michele & stefan decide to team up & rid the world of the evil radu...directed by ted nicolaou this film seems to be quite highly regarded amongst genre fans & while it's not terrible i certainly wouldn't call it very good & i could't really see anything much to get excited about. subspecies is a rather slow going film, not that much actually happens & while it does try to stay close to certain classic vampire lore there's all this nonsense about a bloodstone & some little monsters that grow from the tips of radu's severed fingers for some reason. subspecies could have been a half decent film if not for the fact that it's dull, i really can't remember that much about it, good or bad. the character's are alright but some f the dialogue is silly & there's a scene which bugged me near the start when the girls are at the castle ruins & one says they have to go because it's getting dark yet it's still clearly the middle of the day & very bright. there's also a scene where one of the american girls finds a coffin that hotel's attic & doesn't really seem that bothered by it, i am not being funny but is some bloke whose house i was staying at had a coffin in his attic i would be very, very worried if you know what i mean. i don't think i would ever want to watch it again, there's no real threat, the plot is weak that mixes classic vampire themes with silly subplots & i was distinctly unmoved by it all. not the worst film ever but hardly the best either.the film looks alright with nice locations & some local scenery although you feel the look is down to the budget rather than the makers attempt a authenticity. there's not much gore apart from a decapitation & some broken off finger tips. for no apparent reason the makers throw in some average looking stop-motion animated monsters that really don't do anything or have much significance to the story.filmed on the cheap by charles band's full moon entertainment production company in bucharest in romania, the production values are alright & better than many later day band productions. the acting isn't great with many of the cast putting in below par performances while genre regular angus scrimm has a small cameo at the start. there's a little bit of style here on occasion with a few scene reminding heavily of the original nosferatu (1922) in particular the bit showing radu's shadow coming down the stair with his long claw like fingernails standing out.subspecies is a film that many seem to like for reasons i don't quite see, i thought it was throughly average at best & overall rather dull. followed by bloodstone: subspecies ii (1993), bloodlust: subspecies iii (1994), subspecies 4: bloodstorm (1998) & the spin0off film vampire journals (1997).

this movie was one of a handful that actually caused me pain. it might be enjoyed by anybody who thinks that it would be funny to see his/her mother in a crowded discotheque full of people half her age "inventing" some totally ridiculous dance in a completely misguided effort to be "hip" (in the parlance of that age). to see ingrid bergman stoop to such a pitiful performance on the disco dance floor was hard to watch. i was embarrassed.to make matters worse, the music in the disco was not realistic at all - it is the bogus idea of some hollywood director about what pop music was like at the time. that is always a total embarrassment in most films of that era - the ersatz music is canned and bears only a painful, passing resemblance to the music that was actually popular in the 60's.mathau is hopelessly miscast as some kind of ladies' man; he just looks lecherously grotesque. hawn's wide-eyed innocence is just too silly. the handsome neighbor in her apartment is portrayed way too earnestly and seriously. he seems like a brady kid who got lost in this farce. painful, pitiful mess.

hitchcock is a great director. ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch. i admire hitchcok on a purely visual and technical level.first the positives. hitchcock invented the notion of the probing camera. the curious eye that is able to withhold or search for information. it isn't exactly a new visual grammar but it was revolutionary then.secondly, hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie. he has an economical style and is always thinking of the audience. he gives them regular thrills, regular jolts of humour and regular shocks. in short, he anticipates the audience's base needs and plays them like a fiddle.unfortunately, the base needs of a human being are mostly stupid. food, sex, the thrill of danger and a little comedy. hithcock caters for all these needs on screen, with the exception of food, which, judging from his size, he catered to off screen.it's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films. a second downside is that most of hitchcock's camera work and visual grammar are now common place. what keeps his films watchable are the simple economy of his tales, the intelligence of his camera work, and his skill at crafting tense action set pieces.so on to "saboteur". this is a light-hearted romp in the vein of "the 39 steps". it jumps from sequence to sequence, until it concludes at the typical hitchcock final act set piece.on an emotional level, the relationship between the leads is not up to par with robert donat and madeleine caroll in "the 39 steps". hence the whole story lacks a certain energy. the plot simply rumbles on like a machine, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes. and new scenes only bring us nearer the end, since it's not clear if the hook is the hero's escape from the police, from the villains or his action to stop the plotted sabotages.there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws. for example, a guy with handcuffs frees himself using a car fan belt etc. (why doesn't he just drive away in the car? surely handcuffs aren't that restrictive? he's able to swim in them, after all!)if you want a better hitchcock wartime propaganda flick from the 40's, i would advise you watch "foreign correspondant". they are both silly chase movies with a catchy finale, but "foreign correspondant" makes great use of umbrellas and tulips, something spielberg rips off nicely in "minority report".7.5/10 - some good set pieces. beyond that, however, there's nothing much to sink your teeth into.

as i post this comment, imdb currently rates alfred hitchcock's subpar saboteur a 7.3/10. personally, i rated it less than half that. honestly, i can't tell how a movie this bad could've come from what is probably the most consistently good director i know of. i've seen about 10 other hitch movies from the 30's-60's. vertigo is thus far my hands down favorite while saboteur is easily the worst. it's hard to believe that 7 years earlier hitch used the very same formula in the 39 steps far more competently. my recommendation would be to see that instead and avoid this like the plague. it's the only hitchcock movie that i turned off before before the end and have no desire to go back and see the rest. if you must watch it, then rent or borrow. don't make the mistake i did and buy the dvd on good faith earned through notorious, rebecca, vertigo, rear window, etc. even a master screws up sometimes, i guess.edit: maybe i was a bit harder on this film than i should've been. it's certainly nowhere near ed wood or manos or anything like that, but there's three reasons i feel i must rate it so low:1) the name "hitchcock" brings with it certain expectations of quality. this film delivers on a few of them, but they're way overshadowed by the darn near non-sensical plotting.2) i want to compensate a bit for all the 8+ ratings this film is getting. hitchcock is like the john coltrane of directors. true fans will find reasons to consider anything by him a work of art, but the high rating on imdb gives more casual movie enthusiasts like myself the impression that this movie is far better than it actually is. 3) i spent $18 on this. maybe if it'd cost me $5 or even $10 i'd probably be a bit less bitter. ;)

rarely will anyone deny that hitchcock remains one of the most creative, inventive and prolific directors of all time, because he is arguably all of these things. it takes true genius to scare generations of film goers out of taking showers and wearing neck ties. saboteur, however, is not creative or prolific at all. rather, hitchcock set out with the soul intention of creating a film to muster "american pride," a certain call-to-arms, support-our-troops title which was a popular theme of the time. with that in mind, hitchcock severely underplayed other important aspects of the film, including but not limited to a logical plot, characterization, believable dialog, and a fluent, running storyline. typically hitchcock does great with espionage films, only a few years earlier achieving cinematic greatness with the foreign corespondant and the 39 steps, but seemingly lost his stride in creating saboteur and merely recycled the same once-thrilling story lines both his previous excursions readily provided. without going into any great depth here is a list of a few of this films major problems: 1. despite having his face plastered on every newspaper across america, the only person who recognizes kane is blind.2. at the dinner party, kane and patricia don't want to run for the door because the bad guys might grab them and tell the party they were "gate crashers." logically, what prevents the spies from grabbing them and saying this at any point during the evening? besides, does anyone need to be reminded kane is a wanted terrorist?3. since when can a fan belt cut through handcuffs? 4. nobody recognizes him...his face is on every newspaper!!! 5. the spies catch up with kane in the ghost town and assume he's the man freeman sent to work with them...shouldn't't he have some sort of credentials? i know spies don't run around with name tags and photo ids but a secret handshake maybe? 6. cop picks up kane escaping from freeman's house, still seems no one recognizes this guy.7. how exactly does the fbi come to believe kane with no evidence? they don't even show kane talking to the fbi, the scene simply fades in and we are forced to assume everything is now kosher.8. when the cops search the carnival caravan how do they know kane is now with a woman? the blind man believed kane's story thus logically would not have reported his daughter missing, kidnapped, or even more importantly running with kane. why does this movie not employ logic?this is a running list. the movie is not exciting, the plot makes no sense, and the world is full of people who willingly take wanted terrorists into their homes and cars everyday because its no big thing. hitchcock fails miserably on this one.

saboteur was one of the few hitchcocks i had yet to discover and i was less than half-overwhelmed. the french title "la cinquième colonne" (i.e. the fifth column, a very evocative phrase for underground spying and sabotage organizations) set my expectations quite high as did the images of the finale on top of the statue of liberty.basically saboteur is as much light-hearted as were the 39 steps (note this is another evocative phrase, even mcguffin as a title) but it lacks most of the humor (so the characters are rather down to earth) and it's definitely not as fast paced. as a chase movie across the usa from la to ny saboteur drags its feet from sequence to sequence. the sequence at the villain's lovely ranch? lovely ranch, lovely villain but pretty tame on the whole, it doesn't really add up to nothing. the meeting with the blind man, the mixing with circus people, the soda city sequence, the ny ball sequence? they fall flat, bringing in more characters with very little added suspense value.one big problem i can point out is the relationship between the leads robert cummings and priscilla lane which is not building up as with robert donat and madeleine caroll in the 39 steps. hence the whole narrative structure is floating, depending on the addition of new scenes. and new scenes only bring us nearer the end since it's not clear if the hook is the hero's escape from the police, from the villains or his action to stop the plotted sabotages. in the 39 steps it was clearly scripted as 1/escaping from the police (so you know the hero can't just go to the police) then 2/running for his life and after the villains to prove his innocence.if you want a better hitchcock from the 40s wartime propaganda i would advise you to chose foreign correspondant over saboteur. they are both chase movies with a catchy finale, well really a gripping one and not just sightseeing in foreign correspondant as well as beautifully efficient scenes (the umbrella crowd, the tulip fields, the strange mills...).

human traffic is purely a `been there, done that' experience  only this time it's quite limp.major themes explored are paranoia, male impotence and jealousy  but only mildly and poorly.a lot of the movie seems to want to imitate trainspotting (drug / `clubbing' culture)  but it fails to include the low times / come-downs that trainspotting deals with (eg: issues with death / dependence, etc). it even tries to come up with a similar monologue to ewan mcgreggor's classic `choose life' speech  but `the milky bars are on me! yeah!'  what the fudge is that all about?!the characters try to analyse their lifestyle but when their lifestyle is so shallow  their analysis becomes boring and repetitious.the soundtrack (for a movie that is trying to be cool) is pathetic. it includes the likes of fat boy slim and cj bolland  come on people  good dance music is be better than this!the characters become grating and annoying (especially half way through the movie) and the lack of care-for-the-characters soon dawns.there are a couple of funny scenes  but they are few and far between. the mother catching the son in the bedroom was quite amusing.but please  i'm sick to death of the star wars analogy scenes. i thought it was much more sharper in a couple of kevin smith's movies (ie: clerks and chasing amy). according to the characters  yoda is a drug fiend hence that's why he is short and bald  huh?!my score  4 out of 10  do yourself a favour and see trainspotting or go instead!

if i wouldn't have had any expectations of this film, it might have received a 5 or 6. as it stands, i give it a 3. the acting is poor, the factual accuracy of the drugs it discusses is lacking, and i feel no empathy whatsoever for the characters.i watched 'adam & paul' immediately before watching this film, and i both laughed and cried on several occasions. this film did not strike even a similar chord. the directors of 'human traffic' may have some off-hand experience of ecstasy, but there is no demonstration of actual drug-related semantic knowledge here. in fact, i find it rather offensive and contraproductive to the strife of making current drug laws less politically oriented.watch 'requiem for a dream' if what you're looking for is an amazing, touching film about drugs.

'bloody birthday' is an odd and, at times, humorous low-budget horror flick along the lines of 'mikey' or a less intelligent version of 'the good son'.set in a small californian town, three babies are born at the height of an eclipse, where planetary alignment means they are somehow born without emotions. ten years later, our three little psychopaths take themselves on a killing spree, doing away with parents, siblings, teachers and anyone else who irritates them. only one teenage girl knows the truth to be able to stop them. there is no explanation for why babies across the world born at the same time aren't equally as twisted but there you go!for a slasher film, it's very tame in terms of violence and gore, which i suppose highlights the problem of casting child characters as the killers as there is only so much you can expose the young actors to. instead, it's amusing and a little disturbing seeing three ten-year-olds plotting murders and carrying out their plans using guns, knives and crossbows. the main reason why it doesn't descend into being totally ridiculous is because the child actors are very convincing in their roles with the way they slyly play the little innocents in front of undiscerning adults while showing their dark side to the girl who knows the truth.'bloody birthday' is rather mediocre as a horror flick, with few scares and little blood, but because it has the shock factor of having kids as the killers, it is a bit unique in that way. one to watch if there's nothing else on.

is it a poorly acted, cliche-ridden pile of trash? of course. anyone who doesn't realize that when they pick up the box in the video store probably doesn't have any right judging movies in the first place. thus, i will now rate the aspects of the film that we actually care about on a scale of 1 to 10:violence and gore: 4 -- for this genre, there are very few deaths, and the gore is almost non-existent. anyone looking for a little blood should probably look elsewhere. the only redeeming quality is the fact that kids are doing these awful things, which raises the bar a little.suspense: 1 -- okay, i feel bad for anyone who gets scared by this trio of dorky looking kids.nudity/sex: 7 -- lots of boobage from three different women, one of whom is the mtv vj julie brown. there are two sex scenes, but little is shown in them.unintentional humor -- 4 -- there are a few good laughs with the kids trying to act scary, but all in all, it's just bad, not funny bad.overall -- 4 -- it's not unwatchable. there are a few fun moments, and enough nudity to keep your attention for the entire movie. however, only watch this movie if you're a big fan of the 80's slasher flicks. this definitely falls on the lower end of the scale, but it's not all the way at the bottom. the real downside is the disappointing ending. it almost ruined the movie for me.

this is clearly a french film. it is about young group of idealist/revolutionary/anarchistic people. it moves very slowly. long takes. long closeups. a minute or more devoted to an attempt to light a pipe full of hash/opium. a long take on how a group overturns a car and burns it. it is a black and white film. the subtitles were white, so about a third of the time they were unreadable. (why do they do this?) i walked out after about an hour and three quarters when it became clear that this picture was going nowhere, slow. i was not the first to walk out. it was the first time i walked out of a picture in my long lifetime. (well, maybe the second.)

well , of course everybody is entitled to have an opinion about a thing ...everything. the presentation was interesting : black and white movie , the year 1968 , students manifestations , general strike , youth , ideals, love.....etc. sorry but i did not sense love , romance . a lover who is all right that his girlfriend sleeps with no matter who ? that is love ? but not only that , the movie is very long and for no reason , i had to stop watching the movie several time because i simply lost interest. i waited for something to happen but .......nothing. the only thing i was impressed during the movie : gypsy fiddler playing in the streets , yes that was nice. i do not think that art should be complicated , encrypted , hidden in secret meanings , confusing .big disappointment and waste of time !

i saw this film last night and came online specifically to see if others thought it was as awful as i did.granted, obviously some people see a lot in this film that i didn't, so if you're one of those people, fine - good luck to you. but i'm a patient person. i've enjoyed extremely long films before. but this was an exercise in torture for me.i honestly felt that this was one of those films with little to say, and that it was more about style than substance - however, the style, too, made me feel like tearing my hair out. pretty much anything interesting that happens during the course of the film happens off-screen. it's like a deliberate attempt to make a film entirely from outtakes - the bits that would usually be reserved for the deleted scenes section of a dvd, if they were shown to the public at all.you don't even get to find out, in the end, anything about the main character, francois. i had no sympathy for any of the characters in this film, except perhaps the violinist & his goat, and the old man who believes that octopuses live to 300 because they're really smart. seriously, i was excited when it cut to a shot of francois holding a gun to his head. i felt so ripped off when even his inevitable suicide turned out to be gut-wrenchingly boring.oh, and where was the editor? off smoking opium, too? i swear, i almost screamed every time i was subjected to an extended shot of absolutely nothing happening, except perhaps someone pacing backwards and forwards, and then finally there would be a very abrupt cut to the next scene, and it would be a year later, and we'd missed everything interesting that happened in the meantime, and everyone was still wearing the same bloody clothes....!?!?!???so, in conclusion, if you liked it - great. but this review is intended as an antidote to the fawning "you'll love this film if you love cinema" dross i've seen posted here and elsewhere. (see? i hated the film and i still included a sly winking reference to its content!)

debra winger's 1987 "black widow" is much better.this is like a lame version, and jane seymour usually does better.chad allen is pretty poor in this too. just playing his usual role as a boring rebellious child.maybe the both of them being from dr. quinn was supposed to make us get excited.if it's on, go grab a copy of "black widow".

i got to watch this one without commercial interruption, and let me tell you, even for a tv movie it was pretty predictable. the actors did a workmanlike job with what they had, and the cast was pretty accomplished -- barry bostwick, jane seymour, frances fisher, etc. however, the script was not only predictable (except for the last scene), but the dialogue was treacly and sounded as if it was lifted from a third-rate romance novel. jane seymour's psychotic monologues were laughable. i'm sorry, but i find it hard to believe that anyone that creepy would arouse no suspicions whatsoever. as bad as theresa russell was in "black widow" -- and she sure stunk it up -- she at least had the sense to play her pseudo-characters somewhat straight. seymour is a much better actress but didn't overcome the material here.lastly, the musical score is incredibly cheesy. it's almost a satire of its genre, like a kenny g meltdown. a movie with such a lackluster and derivative script really should have gone for something edgier.

this is so blatantly a made-for-tv ripoff of black widow (1987) - even the insect titles are so similar.if you want a better "marrying for money" movie, check out black widow, starring debra winger & theresa russell.these movie is cheesiness at its best..! i just had to watch it entirely to see how it ended.

i couldn't believe how bad this film was, and trust me, i was not expecting a masterpiece from a made-for-cable film. i taped it just because i liked jane seymour. i've seen her enough to know that she is certainly an accomplished actress, so i just don't know what happened here. the characters were shallow, the dialog stilted, the acting bad, and yes that includes seymour. it was nice seeing her play against type, but not in something this bad. i noticed that she carried a credit for executive producer, so she cannot escape blame for the sheer badness of this film. and oh, yeah, they had barry bostwick playing the male lead. 'nuff said.

i'm usually quite tolerant of movies, and very easily entertained, however this movie was dreadfully disappointing.i watched this movie after seeing on the cover that william zabka was in it (the karate kid bad boy) and during this movie i could see that this would be the only reason.this film is a tremendous waste of the actors talent. the music, and sound is dreadfully tacky - i couldn't believe this of a movie made in the 90's!i wouldn't really recommend this movie unless you're interested in one of the actors.

"the new hope of romanian cinema"...if this is the new hope, then i wouldn't really like to see the saving hero of such a prolific cinema(romanian cinema, that is). now seriously, where should i start? 1. the crappy scenario: are you kidding me, this is not even believable not to mention it's high degree of stupidity 2. the direction: what direction? this movie should have had psychological tension, at least that, since they have decided to make it look as trashy as possible. oky, i admit, radu muntean is no polanski, hitchcock, fincher or lynch(the list could go on), but at least the minimum of effort would have been appreciated. 3. the language: oky, i don't understand why (almost)every single romanian director believes that if you make the movie as miserable and obscene as possible, then you have art. i don't mind explicit language or bad image quality as long as the final result makes it worthwhile. in this case, it doesn't. there is nothing to comment upon, since everything this movie wants to say was already told thousand times, the characters are far too thinly portrayed to become memorable, the "shocking events" that occur are also poorly illustrated and become unimportant. this film relies only on the self-induced emotions, on the "we must" hype. someone was found murdered so "we must" feel sad, frightened or panicked, someone went through this and that so "we must" feel in a certain way. that's baloney. because a movie is a piece of fiction, nothing is for real here. so the only true emotions are those that you discover when you wander deep into it's world(the movie's, that is)*/* * * * *

the screen-play is very bad, but there are some action sequences that i really liked. i think the image is good, better than other romanian movies. i liked also how the actors did their jobs.

family guy. when the show first aired, it was fresh, original, and actually quite funny. now, i have stopped watching it. it has become one of the worst shows on television, combining unfunny jokes, repetitive, drawn out jokes, and the hope that each joke can become funny with the inclusion of the word "bitch." seth macfarlane clearly has issues with himself, and he is obviously pandering to the 13 year old boys audience.i just don't understand how something that started out so funny, so different from everything else, can devolve into this horrible mess of a "comedy" show. i seriously have heard better one liners from a pud comic.it truly is sad to see great shows fail, and watch drivel like this continue on. either seth macfarlane has stopped trying, or he believes that this show is hilarious the way it is.either way, god help us.i hate this show, and will dance an irish jig when its finally cancelled.

formulaic slasher film, only this one stars three ten year olds (all born during a lunar eclipse) as the killers. nice, huh? a little bit of gore and a nice nude scene may make this worthwhile for diehard fans of the genre, others beware.*1/2 out of ****

i like cky and viva la bam, so i couldn't resist this when i saw it for £1.99 in gamestation. it is bam magera's debut scripted film, penned by himself and brandon dicimaillo, and stars the entire cky crew (ryan dunn, raab himself, rake yohn, jenn rivell, don vito etc etc). brandon also is in charge of the artistic direction - which is one of the film's greatest merits - its quite ckyish in its colour style - but also shows progression.basically it follows (very loosely) ryan dunn's break up with girlfriend glauren (played by jenn). vilo (played by bam, named after vilo valo by any chance?) and falcone (bran) play his best mates who reek havoc by doing various stunts.its a bit like the cky films but with a linear storyline (which is very basic indeed) and poor acting. its strange, the usually super charsmatic gang seem to have the life sucked out of them when they know what their meant to say next.the acting and script is pretty appalling for the most part, but the second half of the film is much better than the first (90 mins is a stretch for the flick though), and there are a number of redeeming factors, such as tony hawk's cameo, dicimaillo's sub plots such as 'the futurstic invention awards' and 'the diamond bike', the soundtrack is also very strong (its not all cky and him - in fact bomfunk mc's steal the film in terms of its use of music). in the second half of the film the sense of fun is much more real - especially since don vito has a fairly prominent role in the latter part - and he seems to steal every scene he is in.the film will appeal to those who like the cky antics, but only because of the core material and not the filler or story line bullshit. oh, and will someone tell bam that skating montages, especially in films, is sooo 1998.however, the best part of the package on the dvd is not the film - but the 40 mins 'making of' doc.the last 20 minutes of the documentary deal with raab himself's alcholism and the crew's real feelings towards each other amazing candidly (as usual bam comes across as a bit of a dick, especially towards raab's drink problem and ryan dunn comes across as a really nice down to earth guy). the last ten mins of the documentary deal with a friend (who is an infrequent cky member) trying to kick heroin whilst staying at the magera household with the crew - and a caring unitary side of gang (espcially ape and ryan) really comes across - a startling gem in an otherwise dull dvd.for £1.99 i'm very satisified - although i hope bam stays to the improvised and short skits from now on.

i kind of like bam margera, so i was curious. but watching a home production with somebody elses friends and family, with a decent camera and a sound guy, just isn't good film-making. writing, direction, acting and editing is abysmal at best. but i sat through half of it. and why?this film gives perfect examples of what not to do, it is a film student's dream of what to avoid at every stage of the process. cram it into film school curiculums all over the joint!so thanx bam! now i know jackass is for real - cause you ain't looking to win an oscar, dude:)

i did not think haggard was the funniest movie of all time i like cky and viva la bam a lot more. i think a lot of it was just really stupid and had no plot for being a movie. i highly recommend not paying a lot of money for this movie but anyone who likes viva la bam, cky, or jack ass should see it. i loved many parts of the movie and then there were parts that should have been cut out. i think that jonny knoxville should have played in the movie because he is a much better actor then most of the people from haggard and probably could have made this movie allot more funnier. i think ryan dunn was probably the best actor and it should have had bam skating more.

this movie was really bad. it has that quality that a lot of indie movies have: moments of humor filled with long spaces that are completely boring. any die-hard bam magera fan will prolly like this movie, but then again thats probably the only person who would see it. someone gave me this movie to watch knowing i am a fan of jackass and was a fan of viva la bam, before the scripted nature of that show wore thin. to explain why this movie doesn't work i should just say the premise itself is played outa guy who is with a girl who is horrible to him. and pretty much the whole movie you've got this ryan dunn guy whining and bam magera skipping around like a merry mischief maker. dicamillo's performance is strange at best. it's a humorous little nonspecific canadian french accent that pretty much is the extent of his performance (basically funny for 5 minutes and then its like 'ok you're pretending to be foreign enough already")maybe it would work if they were going for parody but all they succeed in doing is making a movie with an iq of zero. i love toilet humor as much as the next guy, but this isn't even lowbrow its just stupid. its like the only humor to be gotten from this movie is completely inside and the audience, even those savvy to magera and company, are left out of the joke.next time magera is handed a sack full of money let's hope he doesn't blow it on some lousy pet project

wow...i just watched this movie...american people have this stereotypical view towards hindi films such as, all indian films have dances, songs and a love story....its pathetic how far away from the truth that is. this film simply exposes the stereotypical western view of hindi films. horrible acting, horrible direction, horrible cinematography. and all this by a hollywood director. most indian films today are much more content driven, realistic, touching and meaningful than this piece of crap. indian cinema (not just hindi) also cover a variety of different subjects. just like most other hollywood films these days, this shows a very stereotypical view of of another country, where truth is thrown out the window. this is a highly not recommended movie. instead watch good hindi films like black friday, eklavya, omkara, khakee, awarapan, gangster, don, zakhm, dor, sholay, mother india, lagaan...those films are what real indian cinema are all about.

to put in simple words or rather a word, would be best suited by pathetic !!!!!! the movie starts with attracting a little interest by the plot, but, but as few minutes by audience is getting restless for restrooms and getting snacks, or to get a breathe of fresh air outside the closed dark hall....it seems like watching a movie from 1960's where colors were dull, directed by a debutant, and acted by high school students ! movie revolves about a american high headed actress trying make a comeback into films by acting in one of the not-so-great indian movie. her acting is real sad complimented by the worse dialogue delivery.overall: i would not recommend anyone to watch this movie still want to watch: then try watching it at home, when some tv channel airs it, believe me it would be fun as this movie would not get a single advertisement and no sponsors.and better carry a aspirin, u might need it if you cant find a remote control to change channel ! p.s. i have no clue, if the other reviewers even watched the movie ? i did and wasted my $10 on the ticket !

i really like salman kahn so i was really disappointed when i seen this movie. it didn't have much of a plot and what they did have was not that appealing. salman however did look good in the movie looked young and refreshed but was worth the price of this dvd. the music was not bad it was quite nice. usually indian movies are at least two to three hours long but this was a very short movie for an indian film. the american actress that played in the movie is from the television hit series heroes, ali larter. her acting had a lot to be desired. however she did look good in the indian dresses that she wore. all the movie had not a lot to be desired and i hope salman does a lot better on his next movie. thank you.

to me bollywood movies are not generally up to much, though they are still quite desired and bollywood is a big file maker as they have their own fans.the only motive that made me watch the movie was to see to what extent an american actress could change or affect the logic that indian movie were based on. not only did not it change the movie story also this blending caused some ridiculous series of events.i mean it is quite common to see heaps of illogical things through indian movies as they have their own world in their movies. but once you see such incidents happen to an american it makes you laugh. for god's sake can you believe a famous american actress is stuck in desperate situation and feel impotent. can you imagine an american actress falls in loves with a dance instructor whose fiancée already fell in love with american's boy friend and they met each other at the same time. there were lot of similar things to mention. the less said the better.perhaps i was wrong as i expected too much from indian movies.

the basic plot of 'marigold' boasts of a romantic comedy wherein the film industry is kept as a backdrop. an american actress marigold, played by ali carter gets stuck in india. worse that, she is out of money. she then decides to play a small role in a bollywood musical, so that she can earn enough money to get back to her nation. here she gets to meet indian choreographer prem, played by salman khan. basically, the movie fails at the script level. just by calling a film a hollywood venture doesn't guarantee quality cinema. marigold stands out as the best example. the art direction is weak and outdated. musically, marigold turns out to be a dud. shankar-ehsaan-loy's is far from being acknowledged as a decent hear. actingwise, salman delivers of his most amateurish performances till date. ali larter is good and has immense screen presence. performance wise too, she is good.one can also find good reviews regarding this movie at http://www.comingsoon.net/films.php?id=36310

i read the reviews of this movie, and they were generally pretty good so i thought i should see it. i'm a big francophile and art film lover, but i believe this is yet another case in which the critics make something "arty" or "intellectual" into something it is not. i will be blunt: it contains scenes of sexual perverseness that i never, ever wanted to actually see. obviously, the piano teacher has some major psychological issues, but i really did not want to see them displayed so graphically. the film is, in essence, disgusting. i mean, when i saw requiem for a dream, i was repulsed by the last sort of scene with jennifer connelly, but that was not anywhere near the sort of disgust and repulsion i felt during this film.

i rented the video of "the piano teacher" knowing nothing about it other than what was written on the video box. i did this with some trepidation because films that win awards at cannes are usually very good or very bad. unfortunately, this one falls in the latter category. about one quarter of the way into it i found myself saying out loud, "this movie is boring." about half way through i was saying to myself, "where have i seen this before?" at the three quarters mark i had figured it out.in spite of its literary origins, this film is essentially a remake of robert altman's much earlier (1969), and better, "that cold day in the park." although the details obviously differ and altman's work was more plot-driven and less of a character study, the two films are thematically identical. there is nothing "new" to be seen in this production. every aspect of it has been done before: a character spiralling out of control with increasingly self-destructive behavior (abel ferrara's "bad lieutenant" 1992); a perverse and doomed 'love' culminating in an operatic (near) death scene (david cronenberg's "m. butterfly" 1993); uncommonly brutal sex scenes (david lynch's "blue velvet" 1986); and so on. hence, i am bemused by the fact that so many found the film to be "shocking," "shattering," etc. this highly derivative film seems to have been made for the sole purpose of making viewers feel uncomfortable, and clearly succeeded with some. however, i largely attribute such a reaction to a lack of film-viewing experience. see enough movies and you really will, eventually, have seen it all. and while it is true that i saw the expurgated 'r-rated' version, i doubt that the additional scenes would change my overall opinion of "the piano teacher."technically, the film is not without merit. there is some very good camera work and the lighting is excellent. isabelle huppert's creditable performance also helps save it from being a waste of time. this is the first of haneke's films that i've seen, and if i were to see more i expect i would have the same opinion of him that i have of ferrara: an interesting director but not nearly the genius others make him out to be. rating: 4/10.

although i can see the potentially redeeming qualities in this film by way of it's intrigue, i most certainly thought that the painfully long nature in the way the scene structure played out was too much to ask of most viewers. enormous holes in the screenplay such as the never explained "your father died today" comment by the mother made it even harder to try to make sense of these characters.this won first place at cannes in 2001 which is a shock considering. perhaps the french had been starved for film noir that year and were desperate for something as sadistic as this film. i understood the long scenes as a device to keep the viewer as uncomfortable as possible but when matched with the inability to relate to the main character it went too far for me and kept me at arms distance from the story altogether.this is a film for only the most dedicated fan of film noir and one who expects no gratification from having watched a film once it's over. i loved movies such as "trainspotting" or "requiem for a dream" - which were far more disturbing but at least gave the viewer something in the way of editing and pacing. to watch this teachers slow and painful silence scene after scene just became so redundant that i found it tedious - and i really wanted to like this film at every turn.

well, the artyfartyrati of cannes may have liked this film but not me i am afraid. if you like the type of film where shots linger for so long that you wonder whether the actor has fallen asleep or the cameraman gone for lunch then it may be for you. a large part of it is like this with short sojourns into the realm of unpleasantness. i did not find it shocking nor disturbing as some other reviewers have - simply a little distasteful and pointless. the only reason i did not give this one star is that the acting is commendable ans the film is fairly well shot. the plot, however, has little to recommend. a large part of the film just shows a grumpy woman teaching or listening to piano, which might appeal to some people. but lest you think this is harmless enough be prepared for some snatches of pornography and sexual violence just to wake you up with a bad taste in your mouth. not recommended.

i do not fail to recognize haneke's above-average film-making skills. for example, i appreciate his lingering on unremarkable-natural-day-lighted settings as a powerful way to force a strong sense of realism. however, regarding the content of this film, i am very sad to see that in the 21st century there is still an urge to pathologize domination-submission relations or feelings (and/or bdsm practices). the problem that the main character has with her mother is unbelievably topical as is the alienation and uncomprehension felt by walter (i don't mean the frustration of a lover which is not loved back in the same way, which is understandable; i mean that he looks upon her as if she were crazy, or as if he was a monk, come on!). i mean d/s is not something new in the world and i think it is rather silly to treat the subject as if it were something "freakish" or pathological; it isn't. in general, films dealing with this subject are really lagging behind the times.so, for me, i feel that this film ends up being quite a programmatical film, worried with very outdated psicoanalitical theories (isn't it nearly embarrassing?), and that does not really relate with real-life lives and experiences of those engaged in d/s relationships (personal experience, forums, irc chatrooms even recent scholar studies will show this).

isabelle huppert is a wonderful actor. the director of "la pianiste" understands this, providing the viewer with long takes of huppert's face, and these are a pleasure to see. huppert is not an animated actor--she registers emotion with the smallest lift of an eyebrow or flicker of a smile.other than the enjoyment of watching an experienced actor excel in her profession, there is nothing in this movie that makes me want to recommend it. (well, if you enjoy self-mutilation, sado-masochism, and bizarre behavior, "la pianiste" might work for you. other than these attributes, i could not find any redeeming value in it.)buried in all this strange material there is a kernel of truth. people who compete at the very highest level--musically, athletically, whatever--begin as strange people, and are shaped into stranger people by the competitive environment.not worth a trip to a movie theater to relearn this life lesson. 

this movie purports to be a character study of perversion. some reviewers have been gulled into assuming that because perversion is depicted, the film is psychologically deep; actually, considering the salacious material, it is surprisingly tedious and shallow, with no motivational substance. why is the main character the way she is? you won't find out from the script. for a better treatment of the same theme (and a more entertaining movie), try bunuel's belle de jour.

elfriede jelinek, not quite a household name yet, is a winner of the nobel prize for literature. her novel spawned a film that won second prize at cannes and top prizes for the male and female leads. am i a dinosaur in matters of aesthetic appreciation or has art become so debased that anything goes?'gobble, gobble' is the favoured orthographic representation in britain of the bubbling noise made by a turkey. in the film world a turkey is a monumental flop as measured by box office receipts or critical reception. 'gobble, gobble' and the piano teacher are perfect partners.the embarrassing awfulness of this widely praised film cannot be overstated. it begins very badly, as if made to annoy the viewer. credits interrupt inconsequential scenes for more than 11 minutes. we are introduced to professor erika kohut, apparently the alter ego of the accoladed authoress, a stony professor of piano. she lives with her husky and domineering mum. dad is an institutionalised madman who dies unseen during what passes for the action.reviewing the piano teacher is difficult, beyond registering its unpleasantness. what we see in the film (and might read in the book, for all i know) is a tawdry, exploitative, nonsensical tale of an emotional pendulum that swings hither and thither without moving on.erika, whose name is minimally used, is initially shown as a person with intense musical sensitivity but otherwise totally repressed. not quite, because there's a handbags at two paces scene with her gravelly-voiced maman early on that ends with profuse apologies. if a reviewer has to (yawn) extract a leitmotif (why not use a pretentious word when a simpler one would do), elrika's violently alternating moods would be it.a young hunk, walter, studying to become a 'low voltage' engineer, whatever that is, and playing ice hockey in his few leisure moments, is also a talented pianist. he encounters elrika at an old-fashioned recital in a luxury apartment in what may or may not be paris. in the glib fashion of so much art, he immediately falls in love and starts to 'cherchez la femme'.repressed erika has a liking for hardcore pornography, shown briefly but graphically for a few seconds while she sniffs a tissue taken from the waste basket in the private booth where she watches.walter performs a brilliant audition and is grudgingly accepted as a private student by erika, whose teaching style is characterised by remoteness, hostility, discouragement and humiliation.he soon declares his love and before long pursues erika into the ladies where they engage in mild hanky panky and incomplete oral sex. erika retains control over her lovesick swain. she promises to send him a letter of instruction for further pleasurable exchanges.in the meantime, chillingly jealous because of walter's kindness to a nervous student who is literally having the shits before a rehearsal for some future concert, erika fills the student's coat pocket with broken glass, causing severe lacerations to those delicate piano-playing hands.the next big scene (by-passing the genital self-mutilation, etc) has walter turning up at the apartment erika shares with her mother. erika want to be humiliated, bound, slapped, etc. sensible walter is, for the moment, repulsed and marches off into the night.at this point there's still nearly an hour to go. the viewer can only fear the worst. erika tracks down walter to the skating rink where he does his ice hockey practice. they retire to a back room. lusty wally is unable to resist the hands tugging at his trousers. his 'baby gravy' is soon expelled with other stomach contents. ho hum.repulsed but hooked, perhaps desirous of revenge for the insult so recently barfed on the floor, walter returns to erika's apartment. can you guess what happens now? it's not very deep or difficult. yes, he becomes a brute while erika becomes a victim. one moment he's locking maman in her room and slapping erika, the next he's kicking her in the face, having sex with her and renewing his declarations of love. am i being unfair in this summary? watch the film if you want, but i'd advise you not to.anyone can see eternity in a grain of sand if they're in the right mood. i could expatiate at the challenging depiction of human relationships conveyed by this film if i wanted. but i 'prefer not to', because this is a cheap and nasty film that appeals to base instincts and says nothing.i'm supposed to say that parentally repressed erika longs for love, ineffectively seeks it in pornography, inappropriately rejects it when it literally appears, pink and throbbing, under her nose, belatedly realises that she doesn't like being hurt, blah, blah, blah.the world has, for reasons not explained, stunted her. she apparently makes a monster out of someone who appeared superficially loving - but surely we all know that any man is potentially a violent rapist, because that's his essential nature however much he tries to tell himself and the world otherwise.at the end, if you have the patience to be there, there's a small twist. before going to the final scene, where she's due to perform as a substitute for the underwear-soiling student with the lacerated hands, erika packs a knife in her handbag. for walter?yes, you're ahead of me. she stabs herself in a none life-threatening area and leaves. roll credits.if this earned the second prize at cannes, just how bad were the rest of the entries?

a man is builing a hotel with a partner. he finds out the hotel is over-insured. things just get worse. this film has a huge mumber of scenes. they must have been put together in someones' sleep. it jumps around from place to place. it does not stay focused on anything for very long. the ending starts on christmas morning with a hotel fire. it then cuts to a night scene of that fire and then cuts back to day time. the dvd sound track is horrible. it takes a fair plot and turns into the worst film i have scene in a long time.

yet again not quite bad enough to make it enjoyable. in fact this one is just boring. it's reasonably well made, even though the script is bad, the effects are ok and the acting average. (apart from james mason who is always great, but in this one underused)i suppose it is hard to write anything about this film because it didn't evoke any reaction in me what so ever.dull, dull, dull, dull, dull.

this flick is worse than awful! it took a good story plot and turned it into schizophrenic cinema. the photography is extremely amateurish . . . looks like a 5th graders home movie project filmed with malfunctioning 8mm kiddie cameras . . . the editing appears to have been done by somebody having psychotic flashbacks (while on drugs and booze), with scenes cut short, followed by other, unrelated scenes, then chopped segments of scenes pasted in . . . totally unnecessary and gratuitous nudity . . . missing scenes . . . daytime scenes inexplicably turning into night-time scenes, then suddenly back to daytime . . . obviously no continuity. tom skerritt, wendy hughes and james mason's good acting skills are wasted, as are the talents of the "key" supporting cast - (forget the villain and the anderson women - very amateurish acting). this movie is a good candidate for a remake, even with skerritt and hughes . . . just have it professionally done this time.

***spoiler alert*** disjointed and confusing arson drama that has to do with a sinister plan to burn down a major vacation resort before new years day. being insured for ten million dollars the man behind valley view estates in the blue mountains in australia julian fane, guy doleman,is determined to bring his own project down in flames in order to collect. this has to happen by january 1, two weeks hence, before the insurance policy on the project runs out.with his mind totally on his work builder and architect howard anderson, tom skerritt, has no idea that his boss, julian fane, is planning to burn down the resort he's building and possibly set him up as the fall guy. anderson gets a bit suspicious when insurance investigator sophie mccann,wendy hughes, informs him on some very fishy goings on between fane and the insurance company proud alliance. it turns out that proud allience is actually owned, or 60% of it, by fane himself! this explains whey fane is having all these arson fires happen in order to collect the ten million dollars of insurance which is at least twice as much as the entire valley view estates is worth!we later have sophie mccann murdered, in a faked swimming accident, to keep her from finding out whats happening with the suspicious fries around and in valley view estates. it's when lloyd's of london, who's underwriting proud alliance, insurance investigator george engles, james mason, shows up that fane takes a powder leaving his ace arsonist on his own and out of control to blow fane's entire plan.meanwhile anderson has gotten wise to both fane and engles who unlike fane wants the valley view estates to go under for reasons which are never made quite clear, just watch the last few seconds of the film to realize that, by it's writer and director. the arsonist is exposed as he's about to do in his girlfriend with anderson coming to her rescue. we then have this wild chase scene with the arsonist getting lost in the valley view construction site only to have it set on fire, with the help of howard anderson, where he ends up burning to a crisps by the time the fire department came to hose him down.the sudden and unexplained ending never made clear to just what happened to the big cheese in this whole scheme of things the sinister and evil minded julian fane. it's as if fane got away scot-free and only his unstable and deranged henchman, the arsonist, who was only the instrument of fane's crimes ended up as the only person who payed from them.

i've been on a bad run of films. this is a clinker about an arson plot and a psychopath. tom skerrit, whom i really enjoy, was pretty young here. he is a builder with a passion, but he has a partner whose profit motive includes over-insuring and burning. into the mix comes an agent, who is drowned, his daughter, and her nut-case boyfriend. james mason plays the insurance investigator. any idiot, given a little warning, would know something was rotten in the nation of australia. still, they bumble their way. the most interesting thing to me was that the huge hotel that was going to be built, never got beyond being a bunch of sticks. low budget, i guess. the plot could have been interesting. maybe they should have hired a film editor (the did?). half the time you don't know where the characters are, but i guarantee a five million dollar payoff would have probably made a close watch on the structure mandatory. it doesn't work. although there is lots of neat fire.

additionally titled burning man and flash fire for its various releases, this australian made film, shot in new south wales is problematic for its producers from its outset due to several personality conflicts and extended shooting time that prematurely uses up its allocated budget, and although the storyline is at times nicely detailed, below standard post-production finishing and overmuch cutting jettisons the affair. tom skerritt plays as howard anderson, an american entrepreneur with a "passion for building" who is in process of erecting a tourist hotel in the blue mountains region, all the while unaware that his business partner, julian fane (guy doleman) has insured the incomplete structure for ten million dollars, far more than its actual worth, and plans its destruction as corollary to normal summer brush fires in order to collect a handsome sum through fraud. in line with this illicit scheme, fane arranges for an arsonist to perform the incendiary deed, a young man who also happens to be the boyfriend of anderson's daughter, and due to the future resort's being in the midst of a critical fire hazard sector (one of the many unexplained elements of the screenplay) julian has every expectation that his dastardly design will come about without serious hindrance. as the local insurance firm victimized by the crime is majority owned by fane, the policy's naturally skeptical underwriters, lloyd's of london, deploy senior investigator george engels (james mason) to probe into the nature of the felony, made more sinister because of the death, possibly a homicide, of an insurance investigator (wendy hughes) who, in following clues was apparently coming close to the cause of the arson. the setting for the film is the week before christmas, capstone of summer in the antipodes, a dramatic background, but the links within the story are not smoothly compounded, resulting in the presentation of events that are rather difficult for a viewer to follow, a problem heightened by erratic editing, the mentioned heavy cutting, and poor sound and picture quality. skerritt's semi-comatose and droning style is fatally invalidated by this dim sound processing but mason is very effective, as ever, and enjoys the best dialogue with hughes impressive as the too early written-out investigator; doleman wins acting laurels with his performance as the malevolent julian fane.

this movie is honestly one of the greatest movies of all time...if you suffer from insomnia. it is a fool-proof way to guarantee hours of sleep at a time. as the movie slowly progresses, the audience slips into a state of unconsciousness and gradually loses sight of any sort of plot that the movie might actually contain. this effect is surely created due to the lack of sweet action/sweet babes.also, mr. eisenstein was obviously unable to master the art of montage. a prime example of this is the scene on the odessa steps. for no apparent reason, an event that in real life would have taken a matter of seconds is transformed into a seven minute nightmare for any sane viewer. this editing flaw tarnishes any sort of realism in the entire film. honestly, i've seen more realistic editing watching cartoons.some individuals who have commented on this title have hailed battleship potemkin as: "one of the greatest movies of all time" and, "truly a masterpiece". well i'm writing this comment to persuade readers to avoid watching this film at all costs. my best guess is that my fellow potemkin critics simply wrote the wrong words in their summaries. surely what they meant to say was: "one of the greatest snooze-fests of all time" and, "truly an epic fail".in conclusion, don't waste your time. if you are interested in watching a movie of far superior quality, go to www.youtube.com and watch a halo 3 montage. if i played the movie "battleship potemkin" in a game of slayer on guardian, i would shoot it in the face with my sniper rifle and then teabag its dead body. peace!

this is a really really bad movie. however it's good to laugh at the horrible ideas and "special" effects. the plot centers around an eu space agency that discovers a 10th planet that orbits directly opposite the earth. they send a maned mission (they have been to mars and have yet to discover this planet? is anybody stupid enough to fall for this?) to the planet and can you believe it, it's the mirror image of the planet they came from. most everything is predictable from that point. honestly from the title of the movie you can guess just about everything. the only surprising thing here is a maned space program run by eurpoeans :) there really can be no excuse for the plot concept or execution. so it's good for a laugh or maybe if you are in an altered state of consciousness.

this is a very dull film with poorly developed characters, subplots that go nowhere, and barely tolerable acting. it comes across as a poorly conceived rip-off of "2001."the only thing making it worthwhile are the sets and costumes and visual effects. but even that wasn't enough to keep me from nodding off. i would like to get the soundtrack, especially the music during the space flight sequence, for nights when i have trouble falling asleep.

being the sci-fi fan that i am, i was always curious about this film. so i was excited to see journey to the far side of the sun finally get released on an affordable dvd (the previous print had been fetching $100 on ebay - i'm sure those people wish they had their money back - but more about that in a second).anyway, the premise of this film (just like twilight zone's "the parallel") is that there is an undiscovered planet resembling earth on the "other side of the sun". this planet is of course exactly like ours except that it's inverted. this basically means their letters are reversed and people drive on the wrong side of the road.sound intriguing? well that's basically all there is to this film. the first hour or so is dedicated to the preparations for the journey to this other planet. it's just tedious scenes of switches being pressed, banal dialog, etc. there's no point to it whatsoever. gerry anderson managed to find the most boring british actors in the history of cinema to play most of the roles. i mean they are so dull i'm surprised the crew was able to stay awake to finish the film.anyway, once the crew finally lands on the planet (after an interminable sequence of the astronauts sitting and literally sleeping in the cockpit), roy thinnes notices the copy is all backwards on a bottle of cologne and hops back on another ship to tell people about what he has discovered. oops he never gets to do it as he crash lands and dies. the end! oh wait, there's a bonus scene of one of the space executives hurling himself into a mirror in his wheelchair at the end. i guess he wanted out of this film too.i'm really surprised a film like this could get made even back in the 60s. rent if you must. do not buy.

i'm also a sf buff, among other genres, and i especially like those films from 60's and 70's with their "ideas over effects" premise that produced so many intelligent and likable stories put on screen. in a nutshell i completely agree with scott-886's review of this movie. i heard of this film, and being what i previously mentioned, a 60's and 70's sf buff, with a penchant for sf stories with touch of the "twilight zone", i expected a lot, and my expectations were heightened with reviews ranking the effects of this movie "second best" to kubrick's "2001 space odyssey". what a fraud. "journey to the far side of the sun", was ordinary, convoluted, half baked, silly looking film, with laughable amateur special effects (and remember i love films from that era and despise cgi), and it can be fully compared more to 60's sf disasters such as "marooned", which "journey" very much reminded me of. the idea behind it all is not that bad, but building the plot on a story of a twin planet to earth, on which the same world is inverted, asked for a master like kubrick to direct. needles to say robert parish is nothing like that, so he delivered boring and silly movie, that looked and felt like a matinée tv series of those days. not worth wasting your time on, even if you are an absolute fan of the genre.

i never saw the other two "ninja" movies and for all i know there are known, but for some reason i watched this one. this one starts out rather fast as this one ninja goes on a super killing spree. he is almost unstoppable as it takes quite a number of bullets to take him down. he is not out for the count though as he ends up possessing a woman and he then continues his killing ways by using her as his tool. another ninja enters the fray and apparently the only way you kill a ninja is with another ninja so he volunteers. this leads up to a big battle at the end as the dead ninja goes back into his body and they have it out in an all out war. sounds better than it actually turned out being, but at least it was not boring.

have you heard the theory of cloning redundancy, where a copy is poorer than the original? caddyshack 2 is a perfect example of that. they try to duplicate everything from the first movie. now, in a few cases this work. robert stack is actually a little better than ted knight, when they play essentially the same character. i actually like randy quaid, who is no more or less offensive than bill murray in the original. but jackie mason is no rodney dangerfield, and worse of all, c2 demonstrated once and for all that dan ackroyd is one of the worst comedy actors of all time. there is very little that i like him in, and c2 nailed the coffin shut on his "comedic" career as far as i'm concerned. he seems to feel the same, sticking more to tuffy like driving miss daisy and hosting psi-factor. other than that, it's mostly, "been there, done that" for caddyshack 2. watch the original twice rather than each version once, and you'll get more for your rental money.

this is quite possibly the worst sequel ever made. the script is unfunny and the acting stinks. the exact opposite of the original.

this movie sucks. it's horrible. if anyone liked it, those people should get there heads examined. jackie mason's character sounds like a retard. that guy who tries to kill the gopher is a loser and he sucked. even though chevy chase was in this movie, he wasn't funny. this movie had crude and unfunny jokes and did not have rodney dangerfield, ted knight, and bill murray. even though jackie mason's character had the personality of rodney dangerfield's character, mason's character sucks. rodney dangerfield was funny! he should have returned! i don't care about ted knight, but bill murray should have returned, also. the original caddyshack was murray's career performance. if he was funny in the first, he could have been funny in the second.final comment: i recommend this movie to... no one!!!!!!!! this movie sucked!!!! it has sucked, it sucks now, and it will always suck!!!!!!!2/10

when a hardworking entrepreneur is rejected from a prestigious country club, he starts a battle between the members and eventually buys it from ty webb(chevy chase) and turns it into a theme park/golf course in which everyone can join.this is by no means a good movie, but it is still slightly amusing at times. almost all of the comedy is cheap slapstick and bad jokes except for chevy chase. chevy chase plays one of his greatest roles as ty webb for a second time and plays it great. he is not only the funniest character in the movie, he is the only funny character in the movie. even dan akroyd fails to bring humor to this film which aspires to be a great sequel to a classic comedy but falls to rubble with others shown on comedy central. the movie might have been better if ty webb(chase) had a larger role but instead he was reduced to a minor character and the star became jackie mason(who??) they should have brought back all of the cast and made a sequel the right way! this is a perfect example of what not to do when making a sequel to an already great movie. overall, caddyshack ii is humorous but a large mistake.i do not recommend this movie.

i have vague memories of this movie being funny.having seen it again either i have changed or i was thinking about a another film altogether.it seems as if we are supposed to be sympathetic to jackie mason's character however nothing in the movie actually engenders that emotion. its notable that he is really the only person accorded tender dialogue with loved ones. no-one else's character is allowed to rise to the status of even vaguely human.i don't even like golf but as the film went on i found myself really rooting for robart stack and the club guys, really hoping they would repel mason and chevy chase.

caddyshack ii is one of those pictures which makes you ask 'why?' as in; 'why was it funded?': 'why was it made?' and 'why was it released into the public domain?'.to say the least it's a bad film. it serves little purpose but to underline how superior its prequel was by setting an almost identical set of characters against each other in a similar storyline as a 'new money' land developer attempts to buy out the establishment's golf course sanctuary. right off the bat making the follow-up a whole 8 years after the original is somewhat bizarre. i mean if your going to cash in on highly successful picture such as the first one then you have a window of a few years to do so. but leaving it 8 years means that the formula is hardly fresh enough to simply do a follow up, or poor imitation as this is, so your sort of obliged to reward fans of the original by giving them at least reference to if not indeed actual contributions by the actors who made the first one so memorable. but there's little if any of this.instead we get cheap imitations. okay the passing of ted knight in the interim years would have made it impossible to bring back the memorable judge smails but robert stack's inclusion as 'chandler young' (a fellow wasp elitist akin to the smails character) is unimaginative and seriously lacking in the sort of anarchic frustration that made knight's turn so watchable. jackie mason's 'jack hartounian' is a feeble attempt at recreating the non stop wisecracks delivered by the al czervik (rodney dangerfield) character of the first. while dangerfield's role was endlessly quotable mason's is completely forgettable. bill murray's laughably ridiculous groundskeeper 'carl spackler' and his war of attrition with the pesky local gofer is substituted for his ghostbuster's co-star dan ackroyd's role as the militant 'capt. tom everett' who's high pitched voice just splits your sides with frustration as opposed to the intended laughter.randy quaid , brilliant as cousin ed in the national lampoon's vacation series, is quite the opposite here playing hartounian's unstable lawyer. the looks of disbelief shown by the actor's looking on at quaid's character's intended to be hilarious acts of inappropriate violence echo that of the audience. your not laughing. your just asking 'what the hell is he doing?'chevy chase shows up, all be it occasionally and wisely rather fleetingly considering the disaster that's perpetrating itself around him,as club pro 'tye webb' in the films only direct reference to the original not withstanding the golf course itself that is. with his deeply tanned skin and loud hawaiian shirts chase looks like he's just got back from a lengthy summer vacation and needs a paycheck. he distances himself from the events in the actual picture enough that he takes little of the blame and leaves with some, all be it little, credibility still intact. jessica lundy as mason's daughter 'kate' takes over from the 'danny noonan' role of the original as teenager struggling against class divides. sounds ridiculous doesn't it? at least in the first danny (an irish catholic from a blue collar family) and his laughable attempts to make inroads into the white-anglo-saxon-protestant dominated world of the golf club mover and shakers was played out to some memorable set pieces such as being dismissed by the resident lutheran bishop as well as being mocked by the offspring of the local yacht club. lundy's embarrassment of her father's inability to fit-in is hinted at being because of his jewish roots. that aside it may also have to do with him being a classless moron but such intricacy's are swept aside though i stopped caring long before they were resolved. at the end of the day noonan was trying to get ahead in life. miss hartounian's biggest problem is getting the hob nobbers at the local golf club to like her multi-millionaire father so that she can get a date with the club's prodigal white kid. or so i gathered. anyway in summation its poorly written, badly scripted with lame set pieces and wastes a lot of talent. indeed kudos if you were able to sit through it to it's conclusion. it really is a penance. there is that question mark though of why did so many of the original actors not return as opposed to being replaced by performers who on paper at least looked their equals. maybe they just weren't asked. or perhaps i suspect they actually read the script. stick to the original!!!

after watching caddyshack 1 i'd heard there was a sequel and decided to look it up. the movie seemed pretty bad and i told myself to stay away but stupid me gave in and actually bought the damn thing! all the reviews and everything bad you've heard about caddyshack ii are true. the movie is simply worn of ideas and the lamest plot and jokes i've ever heard, the gopher, the acting the whole movie really is bad (randy quaid was funny though).just stay away from this movie as much as you can is all i can really say. i deeply regret watching and buying the dvd but not sure which was the worser decision. just stay away as much as possible.

watch this movie .....only to truly appreciate how good the original is. i'm not real hard to please, but this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen. it hurt me deeply, because i like chevy chase, jackie mason, and dyan cannon. the writing was just terrible! i thought chevy would have at least ad libbed some better stuff than he did. there was hardly anything to laugh at in this movie. i went into it wanting to enjoy it. i wanted to laugh but nearly cried. in the beginning credits it read special appearance by chevy chase. this worried me from the start. chevy is actually in more than i thought he would be. it's more than a "special appearance". too bad the appearance wasn't special. mason's character would have been a good secondary character but got old as a main. i would rather have seen more (much more)of dyan cannon. at least her character was fun, if not well written. i also missed the gratuatis teen sex scene. mr. gopher went from being cute and innocent to a pesky rodent that deserved to be blown up. jonathan silverman is the only character that interested me and we didn't see enough of him.i take it back. try..to watch half of this movie, then...remember the alamo, the maine, and caddyshack i.

it sucked.i returned the video after watching half of it. not funny,just a cheap and desperate attempt to cash in on a very very funny original. junk, forget it, don't waste your time etc etc

caddyshack ii does no justice for the caddysack. thin plot, thin actors(exception of randy quaid). the only thing that is decent with this movie is the soundtrack..maybe. this movie should have been destroyed when the script was written.

why is this one no good when the first one rocked? try the fact that they attempted to replace rodney dangerfield with jackie mason! please! that's like replacing the beatles with wierd al. randy quaid is the only one that saves this movie from a zero.however, don't let this stop you from watching the first movie which was outstanding.

why was this movie ever made?they have tarnished the original caddyshack with this crap.i was only able to watch half of it and i didn't laugh once.at least i didn't pay to see it because it was on t.v. but i won't get back that hour of my life that i spent watching this dreadful mess.there wasn't one original star from the first except for chevy chase and he probably regrets doing this film.jackie mason was supposed to be the outrageous,funny buffoon like rodney dangerfield was in the first but jackie mason wasn't funny at all.jackie mason is no rodney dangerfield.if you want laugh,watch the first caddyshack.if you like terrible movie's,then this you're movie.this movie stinks like a barnyard in july.avoid at all cost.

this movie is so god-awful that it was literally a chore to watch. i wanted to eject it from my vcr and throw it across the room, but kept thinking (foolishly) that it would eventually get funny and then everything would be all right. "you lose, we win, yay!" this movie should be required viewing for anyone who even once entertained the thought that jackie mason was funny. after that, beat them ove the head with this movie until the tape cracks. and if you're even considering renting this turd (or worse yet, have!) i have one thing to ask of you: didn't you even look at the cover? i mean, with crap like this you can tell with just a glance how bad it is! "oy vey!" this movie sucked.

caddyshack two is a good movie by itself but compared to the original it cant stack up. robert stack is a horrible replacement for ted knight and jackie mason, while funny just cant compete with rodney dangerfield. ty webb is funny, being the only character from the original. most of the other characters in the movie lack the punch of the original (henry wilcoxon for example) except for the hystericly funny lawyer peter blunt, being played by randy quaid. every line he says reminds me of the originals humor, especially the scene at his office (i don't go in for law suits or motions. i find out where you live and come to your house and beat down your door with a f***ing baseball bat, make a bonfire with the chippindale,maybe roast that golden retriever (arff arff arff) then eat it. and then i'm comin' upstairs junior, and i'm grabbing you by your brooks brothers pjs, and cramming your brand new bmw up your tight a**! do we have an understanding?). offsetting his small role however, is dan acroyd, who is obviously no replacement for bill murray. his voice is beyond irritating and everything he does isnt even funny, its just stupid. overall caddyshack ii is a good movie, but in comparison to the awesome original it just cant cut it.

when i first viewed this movie, i didn't know the title of it. i realized it had chevy chase in it with the same name he had in caddyshack so i had an idea this was caddyshack 2. at the end of the movie when i did find out it was caddyshack 2 i was disappointed. they could have done better. dan akroyd i thought was bad. the whole story was bad. call this movie by another title, but don't call it caddyshack 2. you give that great movie a bad name. jackie mason's daughter when i first saw her looked like his wife. how old is this girl? geez. how about making this movie a little believable. i thought chevy chase was good.

caddyshack ii is nothing compared to the original caddyshack. but, there are legitimate reasons for it. (1) rodney dangerfield was supposed to be the ace of this film but he didn't like the script, wanted to change it, his request was denied, so he didn't do the film. (2) it was low budget, bill murray had grown to superstar status. ted knight passed away in 1986, and chevy chase the "so called ace" of the first movie (although it was rodney all the way)couldn't't be on more than 5 minutes, because it would cost too much to pay him. but you had dan aykroyd, robert stack, randy quaid and jackie mason, all serviceable substitutes, who none had their best performances.

i saw "caddyshack ii" when i was ten and i mostly laughed because of the horse scene. i should have realized that the movie was as empty as...i can't come up with a good comparison. it's stupid and not even really funny. the cast members from the original who chose not to star in this made probably the best choices that they ever made in rejecting this; why, oh why, did chevy chase return?! and how on earth did jackie mason, robert stack, dyan cannon and dan aykroyd get involved in this swill?! i bet that every person who had his/her name even remotely attached to this junk (e.g., the caterer) is ashamed beyond redemption. so, all in all, it's beyond dreadful, terrible, and everything such. avoid it like you would the ebola virus.

every time i watch this movie blood comes gushing out of my eyes. yes, you read that correctly: i've watched this wretched, foul thing more than once.caddyshack 2 went wrong for so many reasons: harold ramis dialing in a script and abandoning the direction duties, rodney dangerfield (wisely) walking away from the project because they wouldn't allow him to tinker with the script, bill murray showing excellent judgement and not being part of it, and a puppet being pushed forward as the feature player of a cast who deserved much better.i can't help but think of dyan cannon in this and wonder why she's perpetually laughing and smiling. the only conclusion i can draw is that she is indeed the face of pure evil. stay with me a moment. she must have been watching as the film came together and revelled in the untold agony that it would inflict on countless soon to be extremely sorry movie goers who would have this film inflicted on them. she may also have been extremely drunk. that's what i need to be right now to wash the foul taste of this complete and utter failure out of my mind. if i'm lucky it'll be washed out forever.i have seen this film several times. i blame several of them on childhood and being a very dull and dim-witted boy who apparently had no aesthetic sensibility. perhaps puppets are just funnier when you're a kid. no, the muppet show is funnier now ... guess i was just dull. caddyshack 2 is that rare kind of film that is so extraordinarily disappointing on so many levels that you convince yourself after the end credits that it couldn't have been as bad as all that. it was. it is. it will only get worse with time.my reasons for going back to this film, mercifully, are becoming fewer. randy quaid is limited in his role as jackie mason's lawyer. his opening scene isn't bad and brought out my only chuckle. we see him a few more times but it becomes as tired as the rest of the movie and descends with unfortunate rapidity from incidentally amusing to vapid wasteland. randy quaid acquits himself well, and this film owes him big time because if there was reason to watch this film as anything other than a torture tactic, he was it.maybe that's the trick of the movie. it has enough potentially endearing qualities that people watch it, are horrified at what they've done to themselves but later because the pickings were so slim can remember only what did actually amuse them. years later they unwittingly watch it again and the cycle repeats.jackie mason takes a lot of the blame for this film but in fairness, i'm not sure he deserves it. he's really trying out there but it is impossible to not to notice that he spends the entire movie doing a rodney dangerfield impersonation. that's who the movie was written for but i'm not sure even he could have saved it. ultimately this fails miserably through terrible direction, bad editing (shall we count continuity errors?) and a rehashing of the same story with none of the wry humour or heart that made the first film endearing.dragged kicking and screaming up to a three out of ten instead of two by randy quaid's bulldog determination. it isn't even bad enough to laugh at. i've definitely seen worse, but trust your memory -- this one is a dog. if you've never seen it you've made excellent life choices and i salute your excellent judgement.

maybe, like most others who have seen this film long after it's premiere on television, i wanted to see many of my favorite actors in old and obscure form, which is exactly what 'slow burn' is. except, aside from the nostalgic value, the movie itself is not very good.eric roberts plays former reporter jacob ash, hired by a gerald mcmurty (raymond j. barry), a rich artist, to investigate the whereabouts of his estranged son, brian, who had been living with his mother, laine (beverly d'angelo) for the past few years. in a phillip marlowe-esquire fashion jacob ash narrates what would become more than just an investigation into the whereabouts of brian. but, once jacob tracks down laine, his discoveries break open wide a whole lot of trouble. perhaps because events in the film move too slowly, there is never much suspense to this little thriller, not even by the end with the finale routine of revealing the culprits and their motives.however, as said before, this movie is probably one that will draw attention for it's then-relatively unknown cast of actors, which include both a very young eric roberts as well as the adorable johnny depp, who plays laine's stepson, donnie. that may be reason enough to give it a try...if you can find it.

this movie has one of the worst lead characters ever. i say this because he is made out to be the hero when, in my opinion, everything he does in the whole movie screws up people's lives and causes problems. he can do nothing right, yet the movie makes him seem like the cool dude everyone should be looking up to. he has temper tantrums at all the wrong times, he has all the wrong stances on things that end up making people mad at him and getting people killed, he is too nosy, too pushy, too macho, too assuming, makes all the wrong decisions and has no common sense. it's about a private detective hired by a successful painter to find the woman and son that he walked out on years ago. the detective finds the woman and what he thinks to be her son. however, all kinds of things happen to make this story full of crime, drama and twists. it's made for tv, what do you expect?anyhow, the movie is fairly entertaining. johnny depp is very young in this one and has an awful 80's haircut. he chews gum and tosses a soccer ball around for about 5 minutes and that is all we get to see of him.for some reason, the out of print vhs version of this sells for $40 in online auctions. it must be for johnny depp collectors only. it couldn't be because of the plot. it couldn't be.

this really is the worst movie i have ever seen. for a while, i made a habit of watching lousy movies, including "battlefield earth", "delta force commando" and "starship". all of these movies are cinematic gems compared to ironheart.there isn't much point in summarizing this piece of junk; i think it's more beneficial to summarize my reaction to the movie, which is as follows: i become furiously angry and i want to rip the tape out of the vcr and burn it after (roughly) 80 minutes of play.i rate this movie a 0, but imdb does not let one rate a movie less than 1. i give it a 0 knowing full well that i am saying any movie that has any score above 0 is infinitely (undefinably) many times better than this one - that's really how bad it is.

my brother plays "moose" in this film. although most of his scenes were left on the cutting room floor. the funniest line is the movie is "nothing wong with stat." so anyway, this is filmed in portland, or, where we grew up. the dance club is/was called "up front fx". what i loved about this movie is that the main character (who is not named on the box because bolo brings more clout) is supposed to be a police detective...a great opportunity to drive around in a red convertible porsche. i need to get a copy of this, preferably the director's cut, so i can see all the scenes my brother is in. the only scene he is in is the beginning when they are in the dance club. he got the spot because he was dating this cheerleader from a semi-pro football team called the oregon thunderbolts. it is interesting because his name comes up as the first entry in imdb. fame has him, fortune, not so much.

me and a couple of friends went to rent some movies one day, we picked one each and one of us picked ironheart. lets just say that from now on, we never let him pick a movie. this movie sucks

i saw this on sale - new - at my local store for $6 and said "hey! an action film with that guy from bloodsport and enter the dragon, directed by the guy who did enter the dragon - and it's cheap!" so i bought it. oops! this is possibly the worst film i've ever seen, and i've seen some doozies.you know how movies which are intentionally campy, like evil dead ii and dead-alive, are awesome? you know how movies that are supposed to be serious but turned out so awful that you have to laugh out loud, and watch them again, like lionheart (an old van damme film) or john carpenter's vampires, are pretty cool? this film, ironheart, manages to be neither of those. i don't know what the filmmakers were thinking, but it looks as if this movie was made with no time to shoot, no budget for anything, and no script to speak of. (while i'm on the script note, i should point out that bolo yeung has no lines in this movie - the only reason he gets first billing on the box is the fact that he's the only actor in the film that you'll ever recognize (unless you're a jackie chan fan, in which case you'll recognize the bad guy - and you'll want to call him giancarlo!).)what's also sad is that this film is from '92. by that time, t2: judgment day had come out, so you know that the era of 80s campiness was over... but not quite. after this, you'll think 80s chuck norris films, high-school comedies, and jason/freddy sequels were works of sheer genius. things to know:1) nobody in this film can act for beans. the closest you get is richard norton looking appropriately rich and cocky, and bolo yeung looking appropriately mean ... and cocky. everything else is dreadful.2) the martial arts scenes are forgettable - just many instances of white guys with lots of muscles taking off their shirts, yelling, running at britton lee, getting kicked by britton lee, getting punched by britton lee, then falling down. even the final showdown against bolo is disappointingly short, and about as creative as the design of my running socks (and equally stinky).3) the rest of the action is pathetic, too: the guns look like they came from the toy department at k-mart, and indeed they fire with the sound of a capgun. when someone gets shot, they bounce around a little bit, then lie still with splotches of brownish-red liquid on their clothes. britton lee apparently gets shot in the side, but you don't see it at all, then later that day you see the wound ... i've had paper cuts that were worse than that!4) of course then the girl dresses the wound, then they kiss, then next thing you know they're lying in bed talking after sex. huh? what? believable development of the love interest, as well as any kind of character development at all, are overlooked completely in this film. remember how bruce lee's characters didn't need to have sex with anybody to be cool?5) the car chase is by far the worst i've ever seen. it looks like the director was sitting on the curb with a hand-held camera as the two cars weaved down the road doing, oh i don't know, about 30 miles an hour? don't try this at home, kids, these people are professionals! hah!6) really bad writing. here's a scene for you: lee is being followed, so the girl follows the followers to "warn" lee, but her car is too slow. so by the time she catches up, lee and the bad guys are out of their cars and there's a gunfight in progress. lee has killed two bad guys, but the third is shooting at lee when the girl almost runs lee over, so the bad guy runs away. (huh?) then the girl's car stalls and she can't start it. she tells lee she's involved now and she's coming with him. he points out to her that they can't leave her car there because the bad guys will trace it to her. she somehow convinces him that he should decide how to deal with this problem - so he shoots the gas tank and blows up her car. (and remember, later that same night they have sex.) huh?!?7) if you look closely, in more than half of the nightclub shots, the dancers are very much out of sync with the music. the dancers are also all way too co-ordinated with each other (apparently in the '80s all people at dance clubs took dancing lessons). there is a girl in the dj booth with a microphone, but she never does anything except dance. the bouncers tell people who are fighting to "take it outside" - without moving their lips. in one scene, the only bouncers lee and stevo pass by are just inside the entrance, but with their backs to it! also, apparently, if you're a major character in the film, you can go straight to the head of the line.8) lee notices the first time he is being followed, but he doesn't notice the second time - even though it's the same guy in the same car. the girl, however, notices. bad guys get followed twice, but they never notice.9) lee is worried the bad guys will trace the girl's car back to her, even though they have already seen him show up where she works twice. the girl proceeds to leave her child at work, in the care of a friend, while she is off having sex with lee. do not learn parenting from this film!can't think of more gripes right now ... you get the idea ... ironheart is so bad, it ain't even funny, it's sad.

while i agree that this was the most horrendous movie ever made, i am proud to say i own a copy simply because myself and a bunch of my friends were extras (mostly in the dance club scenes, but a few others as well. this movie had potential with bolo and the director of enter the dragon signed on, but as someone who was on set most every day i can tell you that robert clouse was an old and confused individual, at least during the making of this movie. it was a wonder he could find his way to the set everyday. i would also like to think that this might have been a better movie if a lot of it had not been destroyed in a fire at morning calm studios. i can't say that it would have been for sure, but it would be nice to think so. i was actually surprised that it was ever released, and that someone like bolo would attach his name to it without a fight. oh well. also look at the extras for pro wrestler scott levy, aka raven. he was a wrestler in portland at the time...nice guy, very smart.

1 bolo yeung is in the movie ten minutes altogether including when he's serving iced drinks to his boss. 2 a lot of street thugs looking like junkyard keepers get instantly overpowered by the asian superhero who talks like an illegal alien just out of the back of a manure truck. 3 (thug) let this to me -shirt off, gay model like muscles- heee-haaw! hee-heeew! hap hap! - he's dead on the floor with his neck, elbow, chin or balls broken - 4 cheap semi-sex scenes where the white broad come out of nowhere digs the asian superhero. 5 norton (former c action movies star ) does nothing but pose as an eccentric trendy weapon smuggler who traffics white slutty girls hand picked at a night club where they willingly follow some idiot posing as a millionaire snapping at them ( you reap what you sow ) 6 yes, the local police captain is involved and yes, the first butchered cop is the former patrol teammate of the super-hero ( yaawn! ). 7 action scenes are fake, like a) hee-haw! chinese tries some spinning kick b) skinny leg of chinese to the throat of negro thug c) finishing death move to his head too much like walker texas ranger fake action 8 end titles finallyutter rubbish. those people are good enough only to be stand ins or body doubles in other c movies and be credited at most collectively as "stunt crew provided by the county prison ".

the acting was bad, and the plot, well i don't think there was one.some fat blonde chap who is always dressed in a dinner suit, kidnaps a sort from a nightclub, i think he then kills a copper. pointless fights then happen kidnapped girl is put in cage on a boat, why? tough uncompromising martial arts trained cop turns up, speaks bad english and does stuff that does not make sense. its utter tripe. but he does have a nice car. christ on a bike, this film was a waste of 90 minutes.

the hero john keem is going after some drug dealers who kidnaps girls for some reason. on his journey he uses karate and kung fu moves and i don't believe he got hit a single time during the movie. this is crap.

this is a piece of celluloid crap. you can tell when you are watching a "wanna be" mafia film....and this is it. this made no sense at all, didnt start at the beginning of his life, charactors were all over the place...and the term "godfather" didnt even exist until puzo wrote the book!.....then, the real mafia, borrowed the phrase and made it their own after the movie.....this piece of claptrap would have one thinking that the phrase (representing the mafia don) was used back in the 20's...when these people were only called "don"....outside of the original godfather movie, if you want to see another decent mob flick, check out puzo's the last don (part 1) part 2 sucked.

robert montgomery-myrna loy farce about loy (irene) and her fiancé, played by reginald owen, stranded in labrador when their plane crashes. (that's really what should have happened to this highly predictable film.) montgomery lives there while he is waiting for his fiancé.surprise! montgomery and loy are soon attracted to each other. the scene with the bear is so contrived. we knew it was a tamed bear all along.complications ensue when clara shows up. loy wants montgomery to tell clara that they should part ways, when he refuses, she wants to leave at once.you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out how this will end. out with all that snow, it's just too cold for anyone!

if you haven't seen "the war at home", let me tell you what you've been missing. it's a show about ethnic diversity and sexuality that could have only been edgy and funny in the 60's. where america has grown in it's acceptance of race, sexual preference, religion, etc... this show seems to argue with that progress. it's a backward step in america's evolution.for example, one of the ongoing jokes of the show is that the white daughter is dating a black kid from school. this is obviously hilarious seeing as how you can't see that type of relationship at any mall in america. i've lived in both small towns and big cities, so don't give me some type of red state, blue state excuse. not only is this the joke, but the father, who is supposedly not racist, finds this disturbing and asks his daughter repeatedly to break up with her boyfriend, which opposes his "he may sound like a racist, but he's just dumb" character.if this isn't enough, a second running joke is that one of the sons, and soon to be metro-sexual, is ambiguous in his sexual orientation. the audience learns over and over that he isn't gay, but the father isn't convinced, so he constantly avoids his son, afraid perhaps that his son will hit on him, as all gay men are nymphomaniac wild men, who can't control their will. the father always comes to some acceptance of his son, once per show, but usually goes on avoiding him in the following episode.the only way this show can cure itself in my eyes is if the continuous exposure to these "unnatural occurrences in life", open up the father's eyes a little, but that may be too much to ask - and besides, with jokes like these, i'm sure we'll have hilarity in episodes to come like - episode 13, "father votes against women voters", and episode 14, "my muslim neighbor is a terrorist".please drop this show, fox. we're living in a different world from the one your execs grew up in.

i cringed when i heard the first canned laugh track in the first few seconds of the show but yet i gave it a chance. you know when someone offers a line which is only slightly amusing and you hear an obviously fake laugh track explode in uproarious laughter that it's a show aimed at morons who need to be told "yes, it's funny, go ahead and laugh".ugh. i couldn't stand this show as it revealed itself. i can't speak for everyone - after all some people actually like that idiotic show "stacked" (which makes me wish to vomit). i can imagine those who like "stacked" might actually like this drivel, too. some people still get a kick out of the old "pull my finger" gag. to me, this show is just about as witty - and just about as original.the themes were old and tired. the jokes were lame and hackneyed. the characters were ones we've seen everywhere before - and the worst of any you might imagine.so... if you like things like burping words and neighbors who say "pull my finger"... you might actually like this show. otherwise... pass it by. it's stupid - and not in a clever or original way. this one is about as old and tired as any show has ever been at its premiere.

this is easily the worst, most offensive piece of crap on tv. i'd love to completely ignore it but fox has stuck it into their sunday lineup, forcing me to find something else to watch between american dad and family guy. the dink-head male star guy is just about the least evolved, pathetic excuse for a human i have ever seen on tv. nothing on the show is remotely funny and pretty much everything on it has been done already and much better by other shows.it's obvious that their strategy is to ram it deep and hard into the sunday schedule and hope someone starts liking it... but i have to break it to ya, fox, thats the wrong hole. the scam not worked on me - i simply look elsewhere - but come on, you freaking boneheads, this show freaking sucks, and it sucks even worse when compared to the rest of the fox sunday lineup.they cancelled arrested development for this steaming pile?

the actors & actresses on this series are ok, but the scripts have been absolutely horrible. this family is so dysfunctional that they are not even funny. in fact, the scripts illustrate very often how not to be a parent. the scripts are so bad, they make homer simpson look like a better father than this one.anyone who is becoming a parent, if you want to see what not to do with your kids, this show is the perfect guide. i think the garbage this show feeds us, is beyond words. michael rapaport has seen much better material in his career (including his role in hitch). they need a strong lead in & better, much better scripts than what i have seen to this point.if you think this is generational, my teenager even turned off one show of this because they thought it was horrible.

this show is just another bad comedy which will probably be cancelled after two seasons. it's not just that the jokes are sexist/racist/homophobic, they're also not funny and clichéd. in the first episode the father said something along the lines of ' i wish women didn't go out and get jobs and have the same rights as men blah blah blah' that really helps attitudes huh? then he was making fun of his son saying he was weird. what parent says their kid is weird? so overall this show is boring, unoriginal, offencive, clichéd and most of all not funny. yeah american dad's offencive. but it does also make you laugh and is obviously taking the micky. thats the difference.

i would label this show as horrendous if it weren't for the fact that it's on the same network as arrested development. because it is on fox and getting renewed while ad got cancelled. it is absolutely beyond words how atrocious this show actually is. but let me try and describe it. take an extremely low rate archie bunker and have him spout out humor that would have been out of date if it were on married with children. then take great plot lines from ad (son has an ugly, boring girlfriend) and dumb them down so the idiots who watch sitcoms can understand them. if you watch this, i will have completely lost respect for you, as should your family. however, if you are a fan, you should love fox's new comedy 'til death. looks like real funny, cutting-edge stuff. i mean, married couples not getting along ... brilliant.

i finally managed to sit through a whole episode of this show. i was very, very tired. clearly. previously i would always have to turn it off because i thought it was that bad. watching a full episode convinces me that it really is that bad. i couldn't even tell you what happened but i distinctively remember not laughing. for people who think this is the new all in the family or married with children...have you ever actually watched those shows? they are well written and well acted and most importantly, funny! this show is not funny. you might think so if this is the first sitcom you have ever watched. i cannot see who else would. i echo all previous sentiments about arrested development, etc... it's probably my own fault for getting frustrated with television and not watching it, thereby allowing the stupid people to dictate what actually stays on the air.

i've always loved horror flicks. from some of the usual well-known like "the exorcist" to some of the more underrated like "black christmas" or "just before dawn". but who are people kidding,even calling this trash a b-movie. it's straight up bottom-of-the-barrel z-grade. the acting is the worst ever on film. really,i've seen better on an episode of the "young and the restless"...spoiler...lookout for when the woman comes to tell them about the legend of jack-o. she pauses sometimes for a matter of seconds as if someone is flashing her cue cards and she's struggling to read her lines. a riot! oh,and besides the bad acting,absolutely no gore or f/x. and jack-o looked like a plastic lit pumpkin. watch linnea quigley in "night of the demons",or "silent night,deadly night",far superior flicks.

how is it in this day and era, people are still dumb enough to think that other dumb stuff is smart? maybe dumb people like watching stuff that makes them feel smart. such as 'the war at home'. 'cuss it's even dumber than the dumb people who watch it. there are no jokes, only half-jokes and slight gags that barely even warrant a tiny internal smile. the acting is your typical, unsubtle, idiotic, standard sitcom flailing-limbs type acting. and why oh why did this crap replace arrested development? well you gotta hand it to fox. they know that they need to have stupid shows to attract all the stupid viewers. you see, the reason arrested development wasn't massively popular was because it was so smart. it was so smart that it made dumb people feel bad about being so dumb. and of course, if a dumb person encounters a smart person, the dumb person will hate the smart person. most of the time anyway. either that, or try and mooch off of the smart person. if you like this show, and are one of the dumb people, i truly cannot fathom what it must be like not to have open eyes and open minds. i cannot fathom what it must be like to be mindless, laughing drones, influenced by every little thing. basically, people who laugh with a laugh track are parrots. trained, obedient, mindless parrots. maybe i shouldn't insult parrots by comparing them to you. you know who you are. (if i seem like a bastar* in this review, it's because i'm so annoyed at ad being canceled.)

you've seen the same tired, worn out clichéd sit-com stories, characters, stories 1000's of times beforeonly this excels at sucking more than others. first and foremost there isn't a single character in this show that's even remotely likable...in particular michael rapaport's. dave gold is by far one of the biggest asses ever to grace a television screen ever...repugnant comes to mind. if in real life a father was this unlikable, cruel and just generally unfit to parent...fratricide would be your only option. to call the remaining characters stereotypes, would be too complementary. if these characters ended up on life-support the line to pull the plug would be light years long. how this show finished one complete season, much less 2 is a mystery. fox cancels "arrested development" and keeps this on the air??? you tell me the terrorists aren't winning.

how can stuff like this still be made? didn't seinfeld, arrested development, the office etc etc kill this old-fashioned unfunny crap off? apparently not...i'm actually quite a fan of michael rappaport and have enjoyed his various cameos and supporting roles (copland , friends) but in this he sucks but anyone would struggle with this script.my wife enjoys it. but she's brazilian. and if you've ever seen a typical brazilian sit-com you would understand why she would think this so funny.just to demonstrate how predictable the show is and to prove a point with her i guessed what the next 3 or 4 plot developments/lines would be while watching it for a while and was correct almost word for word! i felt very smug. this annoyed my wife as she hates it when i do that (can understand why but i felt good so screw-it!)

man, this movies sucked. it appeared to have like seven different plots going on at once and they all made little to no sense. the special effects, costumes, and all that stuff were beyond awful. the acting was particullary bad. everything seemed so forced, especially the lines from the woman with the huge eyes and the little kid (his "noooooo" as he gets burried is so unenthusiastic it's laughable). a good portion of this movie is rather funny anyway. the one woman's death where she shoves a knife into a toaster, gets electrocuted, and magically turns into the crapiest skeleton dummy in the world had my friends and i laughing for a good ten minutes.bottom line: if you're into watching really horrible movies, seek this one out. if not, run for your life.

i bought this out of curiosity. how did john carradine (who died in 1988) and cameron mitchell (who died in 1994) make appearances in a film made in 1995? thanks to the miracle of unused film can footage that's probably been sitting on a shelf somewhere for ten years, that's how! you can tell because the film stock used to shoot their scenes doesn't match the film used for shooting "jack-o." the curse of ed wood lives on. the good thing for both carradine and mitchell is that this is exactly the kind of movie you'd expect to find on both of their filmographies. same goes for scream queens linnea quigley, brinke stevens and dawn wildsmith.the setting is oakmoor crossing on halloween, and some kind of curse is released when dumb, beer-guzzling teens disrupt a grave. the result: a hulking killer with a scythe and a big plastic pumpkin on his head! he (it?) goes after the wholesome kelly family for revenge (and kills others who get in his way). the father opens a haunted garage for the neighborhood kiddies. the son (ryan latshaw, son of the director) has one continuous, perplexed facial expression for all his scenes and one hilariously badly acted dramatic scene lying in a grave. at least he's a kid. the mother's eyes about pop out of her head while she strains to read her dialogue. there is also an annoying woman who shows up to explain things who seems to be trying to phonetically pronounce all of her dialogue.so what about the name actors? you see stevens, wildsmith and mitchell briefly on a tv screen (they're used to pad out the time). linnea has a bigger role as a babysitter, and she does exactly what she can with it. her enthusiastic performance helps a little bit. there's also one out-of-nowhere laugh when an ultra-conservative couple who watch a rush limbaugh clone on tv bite it. the woman slips on a rug and stabs a toaster with a knife. she's electrocuted and the end result looks like a flame-broiled muppet.all and all, pretty entertaining stuff! i wasn't bored!

i had known brad linaweaver at florida state u in the early 70's when he was an inspiring, inventive writer who i thought was headed for greater glory.and that is why i rented this video. well, well, well, the time has not been kind to mr linaweaver. i suppose the pressures of making a living makes higher aspirations expendable. another flower whose bloom has come and gone un-noticed in the summer breeze. amen. there is nothing more to say. and nothing more to add. a sad epitaph to a once blossoming career as stated above. but it is the price one pays for chasing shadows without a firm foundation or goals for oneself in life. because this movie has no goal, no purpose, and i kept telling myself, what happened to brad's creativity, his once shining genius? gone, gone, years of neglect has deteriorated his once shining mind.

i felt compelled to write a review after seeing the only review which gave this film a suspiciously high 9/10 rating. i say suspicious because it looks less like a review but more like a publicity statement. perhaps the filmmaker himself, or one of his mates, has written that "review"? naughty, naughty.i watched this movie on the propeller channel on sky tv expecting it to be truly awful. the special effects used were to be honest very, very good for a low budget film, and some of the acting wasn't that bad either, but most of the acting was really awful, but well done for trying, as i expect most were pals of the filmmaker.i think the filmmaker has done really well by trying to punch above his weight. i did find some of the film funny because it was trying to be super cool when it just wasn't.if you don't take this film too seriously and watch it whilst drunk with some mates you might well have a good time but probably not in the way it was intended. this film is no way a 9/10 but worth watching for a laugh bearing in mind it was made on a very very low budget and in fairness due credit to those involved in it's production.

i really did not want to write a harsh review of this movie because i genuinely appreciate how hard it is to make any kind of movie on an incredibly low budget, let alone attempt something as ambitious as a sci-fi.however this movie is truly awful. the acting is among some of the worst i have ever had to endure and as a fan of low budget movies that is a pretty serious accusation to make. there are plenty of aspiring actors out there who would work on a deferred payment scheme if they believed in the movie and what the director was trying to achieve. i'm sure the actors did their best as did everybody else involved in this production, but it simply was not good enough to pull off something of this magnitude.then there is the dialogue. very poor indeed. there is no excuse for that. i got the impression the script was hastily written on the back of a beer mat after some epic boozing session. i hesitate to use the word 'laughable' but that's exactly what the script is. i had no empathy with any of the characters. indeed they grated on me with the result that on more than one occasion i wanted to thump a couple of them mr stirton has overstretched himself by taking on too many roles. clint eastwood he is not. again, there are talented people out there willing to work on deferment if they believe in the project.much has been made of the special effects in this movie. for the money, they are exceptional, if somewhat overused. it is like someone said "i have after effects and boy am i gonna use it". whoever did the cg work was among the most talented of this crew.quite simply the money was not available to make as ambitious a movie as this attempts to be. kudos for attempting it, but unfortunately it fails to reach its heady goals in far too many ways.i salute everyone involved with its production, i really do, but for their next effort they either need to get a better producer or lower their sights to something more manageable.in conclusion i cannot recommend this effort to anyone other than the most enthusiastic of film students or habitual insomniacs. if you want to watch a true masterpiece of low budget sci-fi films try the student made "dark star" by a certain mr john carpenter.

i went through great efforts to get this movie after reading the comments on this site. i really don't have time to write reviews but i felt this was my duty as a sci-fi horror buff. this is only the second review i have written. the other was for dracula 3000. now to the point. this movie sucked. plain and simple. i kept wondering if i was watching the same movie as those who wrote all those "lovely" comments. i have seen movies with bad effects, bad acting, bad sound, you name it and i've seen it. but this really sucked. i don't care how much it costs or didn't cost to make, movies like this and dracula 3000 should be banned and the whole cast and crew arrested and jailed for time murder. by the way, did i mention that this movie sucked. i mean really sucked. the plot was non exist and the acting was weak. it seems like the writer saw pitch black and got upset because he didn't think of a plot like that first so he decided to make his own ripped off version. but instead, the suck factor took over and possessed him. don't watch this. you'll have more fun if you pull down your pants and sit on burning coals.

i pride myself in being able to sit through everything. i think "if i've paid the rental fee, then i'm going to at least watch it". i have found the exception to this rule- the planet. i don't know what the exchange rate is, but reading through the other comments i can only guess that £8000 must be around $150. i'll date myself but this movie reminds me of the old steve reeves movies of the 50's. he was a bodybuilder turned actor. he was in these really awful italian, dubbed movies that starred reeves as hercules or some other muscle bound hero. as a kid watching them you couldn't quite articulate why these movies stunk- you just knew they did. mike mitchell is the new steve reeves. that's it.. that's what this really was- a new telling of an old italian "spaghetti sand and sandals" movie. and, i kid you not- where was reeves born? glasgow, montana. this movie isn't so bad that it's kind of fun to watch- it's just plain bad.

in all, it took me three attempts to get through this movie. although not total trash, i've found a number of things to be more useful to dedicate my time to, such as taking off my fingernails with sandpaper.the actors involved have to feel about the same as people who star in herpes medication commercials do; people won't really pay to see either, the notoriety you earn won't be the best for you personally, but at least the commercials get air time.the first one was bad, but this gave the word bad a whole new definition, but it does have one good feature: if your kids bug you about letting them watch r-rated movies before you want them to, tie them down and pop this little gem in. watch the whining stop and the tears begin. ;)

alright, we start in the office of a shrink, and apparently not a very good one. the main hero from the first jack frost is in the shrinks office blurting out random rhymes about jack frost. gee, alright my brother is yelling ''turn it off!''. anyway, back to the crappy movie.the shrink has his speaker phone on and is letting his secretary and her friends listen in on this heroic insane sheriff. i suppose he is supposed to be the hero from the first movie, but he looks nothing like him!. yadda yadda yadda, they laugh at the poor sheriff, yadda yadda. now some people are digging up the anti-frozed snowman, yadda yadda, now we're in a lab with some type of doctor people.. i don't quite see how this has to do anything, but their poking the anti-freeze/evil killer mutant snowman with needles, heating it, shocking it, adding strange and bizarre chemicals to it, the whole nine yards. nothing. alright, they give up and leave it in a fish tank. one of the doctors leaves his coffee on the top of the tank. the janitor walks in, cleans stuff, bumps the fishtank and the coffee spills the tank which makes jack alive.behold the power of mocha! now somehow he is in..uh.. i believe the bahamas... but it looked more like hawaii.. but it couldn't be hawaii! unless they spent all of their budget on the dang air plane tickets. bah.. i wont spoil the rest of this rotten movie, so you'll have to rent it and watch it your self... er... i wouldn't suggest doing so though.... sheesh..

for me this movie is essentially like a feature length pilot episode for a tv series. it reminds me particularly of the british remake of the tv series wallander, starring kenneth brannagh. people interviewed by the police are hardy, and often as bitter as the weather, the lead investigator has huge family problems, investigations invariably lead to cruelties of the distant past, and the plotting is labyrinthine with strange occurrences and subplots making sense only at the end. both have excellent cinematography.the plotting of jar city is extraordinarily reminiscent of a standard uk or us crime series. effectively you could take the plots of any of the episodes of touch of frost and transplant them on top of the bleak locale in this movie and have an effective sequel.really the script couldn't be more obviously from the cookie cutter. you get even the most familiar of motifs, such as the police going to the local prison to interview a manipulative and dangerous psychopath, who inevitably explodes at the end of the interview.i'm absolutely convinced that this is scones and jam for many folk, but i feel it needs pointing out to people like myself who do not go to the cinema to watch television. what i felt a keen lack of was message. the movie takes as its theme the genetic studies in iceland. icelanders in genetic terms have remained largely isolated from the outside world, presenting a great opportunity for scientists to study their genetics. lots of information concerning the heredity of the population has been kept, and many genetic diseases unique to iceland can be traced effectively in a population that has refrained from interbreeding, and is remarkably genetically homogeneous (it's like trying to put together a jigsaw puzzle of the london underground map, instead of a jigsaw puzzle of a field of daisies). a company called decode genetics attempted to set up a database carrying all the genetic and hereditary information for the entire population of iceland. due to privacy concerns this project was terminated, and at the end of last year decode genetics went bankrupt in iceland. the episode is a rich topic for debate.but in this movie genetics and medical science are not there for education's sake, they're there for weird atmosphere.it's a grisly movie if you are interested in that, and there's often a morbid focus on food to accompany events, like a coroner who eats lunch in between incisions. the most queasy for me was when the lead inspector devours a sheep's head. unfortunately for me this occasionally became farcical. the movie attempts the rather delicate task of mixing the grisly with the sentimental, and ended up providing unintentional humour towards the end. this is the equivalent, in cinematic terms, of attempting to prepare fugu, if you're not well-qualified, deft of hand and sharp of eye, you poison the client. this rather novice director should have lowered the tariff on his performance.i walked out of this movie feeling rather bad about myself and about life in general.

why spend a moment slogging through this awkward and self-conscious movie? every now and then, after an hour of tedious plot and amateur acting, we start getting bits and pieces of the big band swing that made tommy and jimmy dorsey, separately and together, the great musicians they were. occasionally -- in a jam session with art tatum, with tommy dorsey and his orchestra doing "marie" and, a standout, jimmy dorsey and his orchestra fronting bob eberle and helen o'connell singing "green eyes" -- we get a complete song. unfortunately, the movie is in the public domain and the dvd transfer is just as bad as the acting. my copy has only four chapter stops. that means you can get arthritis in your fast- forward finger trying to speed through to where the good stuff is. the swamp you're moving through is hollywood's version of the life and battles of the two dorseys. tommy, superb on trombone, and jimmy, superb on saxophone, usually couldn't stand each other. in 1935 they finally split, with tommy starting his own orchestra. each had greater success alone than they had achieved together. they reconciled when their father died in the forties, which is where the movie ends. they later managed to tolerate each other in the orchestra led by tommy as the big band era faded out in the fifties. tommy died in 1956 at age 51, vomiting in his sleep after booze, pills and a big meal. jimmy died of cancer at 53 in 1957. jimmy was hugely talented and, from all accounts, a reasonably easy-going guy. tommy was hugely talented and, from all accounts, often an overbearing jerk. but good music makes up for a lot of faults, and the big band sounds the two created helped define the swing era. they play themselves in the movie, and we see them develop from tussling tykes (with child actors) to grown men battling and yammering at each other. the movie is lumbered with not just their two parents, played by those hollywood irish clichés, sara allgood and arthur shields, who just want their boys to get along with each other, but also with a major sub- story involving a romance between janet blair, as a childhood friend of the dorseys who becomes a vocalist with them and serves as a nearly full-time mediator and enabler, and william lundigan, as a piano player. blair is not bad at all. however, if you want to see why she never became the star she quite probably should have become, just look at the films, like this one, that her studio put her in. no wonder she left hollywood. lundigan simply takes up space. how bad is this movie, other than when we can actually hear the dorseys play? well, here's a song written especially for the movie and given to blair to warble. it's called "to me." to me...you're the rose of a rosary...the rise of a rising sea...the glow of a star... the rose of a rosary? the movie doesn't get any better than this, and it can't get worse. still, if you like the dorseys and if the price is right...well, in hindsight i'd still not buy it. the highlight, for me, is eberle and o'connell singing "green eyes." you can watch them on you tube for free. you'll also find there quite a bit of each of the dorseys. i wish i'd known.

i have to agree that the movie is not the best i've ever seen, but i would like to make mention that the actors portraying tommy and jimmy dorsey were the actual dorsey brothers. as actors, they were wonderful musicians. the movie, based on their famous split, would have been better had professional actors played the parts. many movies made during this time frame took advantage of the popularity of big bands. most often, the movies were not that good because musicians are not actors by trade. most of the movie-going audience didn't go to see tommy or jimmy dorsey playing themselves; they went for the plot and the music. i've never been much of a dorsey fan, but the music is good even today.i have to comment on a previous post regarding the actors who played mom and pop dorsey and that their accents would be considered extreme by a dublin audience. arthur shields and sara allgood were actually irish actors, both born in dublin. you might remember mr. shields as the reverend mr. playfair in the quiet man and ms. allgood as mrs. monahan in cheaper by the dozen.

upon writing this review i have difficulty trying to think of what to write about. nothing much happens in this film. the storyline is a south asian woman who falls for an english londoner. the problem is he and his friends have had a racist streak. at the same time her friend at work is unknowingly to her having sexual relations with her brother, and it just escalates from there. the problem is that this movie is very predictable. as soon as all this stuff has happened it's all pretty much standard. it drags slightly even though it's only about 90 minutes long. this is more of a chick flick than anything else. so if you're male i do not recommend this film to you.

i find it difficult to comprehend what makes viewer's feel this is a powerful movie. i would guess that the main intention of this film would be a character study and the effects of racism in a british community. it is therefore all the more disappointing that all the characters are two dimensional and the acting is at the level of a college performing arts course. i'm always sceptical of "improvisation", another word for being too lazy to write a decent script. i was embarrassed by the performances and sat in an audience who laughed when they surely were supposed to be moved by the story. racism is a serious issue but i think a subtle approach in cinema works far better than laying it on with trowel.

that's what i kept asking myself during the many fights, screaming matches, swearing and general mayhem that permeate the 84 minutes. the comparisons also stand up when you think of the one-dimensional characters, who have so little depth that it is virtually impossible to care what happens to them. they are just badly written cyphers for the director to hang his multicultural beliefs on, a topic that has been done much better in other dramas both on tv and the cinema.i must confess, i'm not really one for spotting bad performances during a film, but it must be said that nichola burley (as the heroine's slutty best friend) and wasim zakir (as the nasty, bullying brother) were absolutely terrible. i don't know what acting school they graduated from, but if i was them i'd apply for a full refund post haste. only samina awan in the lead role manages to impress in a cast of so-called british talent that we'll probably never hear from again. at least, that's the hope. next time, hire a different scout.another intriguing thought is the hideously fashionable soundtrack featuring the likes of snow patrol, ian brown and keane. now, i'm a bit of a music fan and i'm familiar with most of these artists output, but i didn't recognise any of the tracks during this movie (apart from the omnipresent "run"). b-sides, anyone? we get many, many musical montages which telegraph how we're suppose to feel. these are accompanied by such startlingly original images as couples kissing by a swollen lake and canoodling in doorways. this is a problem, as none of the songs convey the mood efficiently, and we realise the director lacks the ability to carry the emotional journey to the audience through storytelling and dialogue alone.the ending is presumably meant to be just desserts, as everybody gets their comeuppance and there is at least one big shock in store.. but i remained resolutely unmoved because the script had given me no-one to root for. it's not enough to tackle a hot-button issue, you have to actually give us a plot that hasn't already been done to death and individuals who are more than window dressing. as it stands, this film is a noble failure, with only the promising lead actress and a few mildly diverting punch-ups to save it from the bin. 4/10. must try harder..

the guy mentioned to sue for the 1.5 hours wasted of his life, i cant disagree on that one. the movie started as some kind of class project cam thing, and ended up in a dark room. whenever the girls where fully nude there magically appeared light all over, i know i dint write the script or having anything to say about it. but this one is like a bad remake copy of saw with a bad ending. to think of a man who actually wrote this story, sick. this is really a shocking movie cant say ist horror cause its not. its mere the brutality and the violence that made me sick. it really is frustrating to watch a movie without ending, its like bang, in your face. the movie is done now you can go home. cons -cam -lighting (althrue i think is was supposed to) -overdone -sickeningcons -real in your face -acting was good in my opinion -it sucks you inoverall the movie is not my taste of movie the witer wanted us to know that these things happen, and the man wrote his own little fantasy. if you ever saw the movies saw ? they all had a moment of comfort in it something to hold on to. this one ? does not. maybe its just me, that im too soft but this movie made me tremble, and the story is real short, sick man kills girls slowly. but the actors sucked you in this movie every blow every scream you could almost feel it.and to be honest, i was to quick to judge about this one, its a terrible movie ? no its not. its an overdone example of reality, this is a real as it could get. but don't watch this movie if you expect great mystery or a real plot, or even some kind of story. man gets girls in a dark room and kills em one by one, thats really it.

from reading the back of the box my first thought was that this is probably a knock off of saw 2. i couldn't be further from the truth. it seemed to me like they gave somebody with downsyndrom a camera phone and $10.00 and told them to make a movie. the plot didn't exist and neither did the acting. it was almost as if i was watching a silent film about grass growing. it didn't surprise me at all to find out later that the entire film was "improvised". by the end of this "film" i had lost the will to live and i may have gotten aids just from viewing this piece of cinematic crap. it was about 70 minutes that i could have spent doing something that was less painful. like jumping off of a building.

overambitious and shoddy; and at times too darkly lit. dark reality's scenario is not even close to being original. dark and dank basement. kidnapped prisoners. fearful survival. carey(alisha seton)tells her family and friends she will be backpacking across europe. she doesn't make it out of town. she is grabbed from a rainy sidewalk, drugged, and awakes chained in a dungeon. she eventually realizes she is not alone and upon meeting a few of her fellow captives there is different thoughts on survival. her cell mates start dying off one by one. can she garner enough strength and courage to see daylight again? others in the cast: laila dagher, rachel oliva, eva derreck, arthur bullock and jen parker.

this "movie" will give me nightmares, i will wake up drenched in sweat, screaming "i didn't make this film please don't blame me!" i honestly think it would have been more entertaining to watch a fat guy eating lard in his moms basement for a hour or two, than to watch this crap. i understand money was tight but goddamn what the hell were they thinking there was no thought, plot or effort put into this. this movie needs a warning "please for the love of god don't fund the drama department a the local jc." on an other note these are the least likable characters i have ever seen, and i have seen movies with hitler in them. so lastly take my advice the next time you even think about renting this just pop a few hundred adivl and let the sleep come.

maybe i saw a cleaned up version, but other than a few flashes of breasts, i'm not sure what over the top nudity these other commenters are referring to.all in all not as bad as i was expecting by the previous comments, although the end leaves you wondering ... wtf? it was dark, but not so much that you couldn't make out the scenes, and i think it just added to the creepiness and the terror of the situation.film quality could have been better, but the acting was pretty decent.all in all a decently creepy (and yes, brutal) movie with a disappointing ending.

i know if i was a low budget film maker i would probably be checking this page to find out what people are saying about it. so i really hope the creators of the movie actually read this! i think you should find a way to repay me for the hour and a half of life i just wasted watching this garbage. please stop making movies about something you probably fantasize about. just stop making movies all together...you are one of the reasons it is so hard for indie filmmakers to make it big. do the world a favor and get a job a mcdonalds or something so you can do something productive with your life! i feel like calling blockbuster to complain that they actually carried this film in their store.

my girlfriend and i are really into cheesy horror flicks. especially ones with lots of unnecessary nudity. when we saw the box cover for this movie at blockbuster we thought it would be a perfect movie for the night. we began watching it, already not expecting it to be great, but thought it would at least catch our interest. 20 minutes into the movie we realized that the pace would not eventually pick up and that it was an incredibly boring movie. we tried to get into it, but the plot made very little sense even after reading the back of the dvd box over and over again. the film was shot very dark and it was pretty annoying to try to figure out what was going on in each shot. each violent scenes were very hard to make out, and you never get to actually watch the violence you're expecting. this is definitely a film without motive that was shot poorly and very drawn out. each scene was about 20 minute of the same thing and i felt i got the point after the first 5. skip this film and re-watch another freddy or jason flick and you'll be way more content.

this movie looked like it was shot with a video phone, it had very little plot and unnecessary nudity. the movie never really came together or made much sense and for a movie like this, of course, there were some unnecessary boob shots. the director was obviously trying to make the movie subjective and different, but it just never gave enough information on what was even really going on, even in the end i was left with a mixture of anger and confusion. confusion from the lack of plot, and anger because i wanted my two dollars back from blockbuster and an 1.5 hours of my life back. they should have a payment program for people who accidentally rent this movie.

the not the best movie in the world???? that was an understatement. i personally didn't like this movie at all. not because of the story line, not because of the graphic violence, and the nudity. the nudity didn't really need to be in it, it did nothing for the story, except maybe the girls were going through a rough time, and being naked probably messed them up even more. but one of the things in the movie that i hated.. was that it was sooooo dark. you couldn't really make out what was going on. i think if it wasn't as dark, and you could see where they were, then it might not have been so bad. all you know that its a basement somewhere. you see no house, no road, the killer in it, all you could see was half his face for about 5 seconds. i wanna see some stuff in a movie. it gets boring after 20 mins of pretty much darkness and all you see occasionally is a flashlight or a wall. then you will hear the girl sobbing. there was nothing that really stuck out to me that was good about the movie, maybe the suspense in the first 10 mins of the film... but not the suspense of how the movie is going to end, but the suspense of.. will i get to see anything in this movie but a few naked bodies and various flashing lights. but honestly people, this was a saw meets blair witch project wannabe. both top notch movies, and both with the correct lighting to figure out what was going on. forget this movie if you can see.. if your a blind person.. you might wanna rent it to hear the screams if your into that sort of thing. but then again if you are blind, your probably not reading this either.. so anyway... bad movie!!!!

you have to hand it to writer-director john hughes. with enormous success behind him in the misfit-teenager/high school vein, he managed to branch out into other areas of comedy, finding in the bargain a great ally in comedian-actor john candy. here, goof-off adult candy becomes a better person after agreeing to babysit his brother's wiseacre kids; it's a surefire formula designed to please both cynical teens as well as their parents, and it isn't any wonder the film was a winner with theater audiences. still, hughes relies almost completely on candy's charm to put the scenario over, and one may eventually grow tired of the repetitious gags with the star front and center. the kids are sitcom-smart, the other adults shapeless blobs, and amy madigan is too intense, too hyped-up playing uncle buck's girlfriend. later became a tv series, which is befitting since the material was already television-perfected. *1/2 from ****

i'm seeing a pattern here. if you see a movie on mystery science theater 3000, chances are if you go to imdb.com there will be hordes of lovers of the film, yet it was picked to be on that tv show because it was sooo bad. i'm sorry but i read a lot about rocketship x-m as being some landmark sci fi film that stressed realism. well if that is the case i could write for several paragraphs about how even with 1950's knowledge this movie is utterly flawed. gravity might be the first obvious observation, or as mst3k did as a skit "selective gravity", also what about when they are plunging to their death and they are just standing there looking out of the window, um would'nt the ship being upside down effect that scene? i would like to think that they started with good intentions and that it ran over budget or something but i think this movie was just plain cheese as in the from under type. just compare this to "when worlds collide" which was released in 1951 to see the true place where this movie ranks, there's no comparison. the movie gets a 2 or maybe 3 on its own, its not even funny to watch on its own. it gets about a 5 or 6 as a mst3k episode as there is no action or much to make fun of, just bad, bad, bad, oh did i mention, it's bad.

i completely understand the historical significance of rocketship x-m, but that doesn't make it a good movie. to begin with, the plot (or what there is of it) is dull and lifeless. five astronauts blast off for the moon  they get knocked off course and end up on mars (huh?)  cavemen-looking martians throw rocks at them  they return to earth and meet a fiery death  the end. believe it or not, but this pithy plot description makes it sound much more interesting than it really is. to make matters worse, john emery's character, dr. karl eckstrom, feels it necessary to give long drawn out speeches on everything from the nature of man to the dangers of nuclear weapons. it's just a thrill-a-minute (sarcasm intended).looking back at rocketship x-m almost 60 years later, i would call the portrayal of women funny if it weren't all so sad and misguided. there are a number of examples i could cite, but there's one exchange of dialogue just after take-off between the male chauvinist pilot floyd (played by the irritating, plastic-haired lloyd bridges) and dr. lisa van horn (the only female crewmember and the constant object of floyd's often creepy attention) that illustrates the film's attitudes toward women quite nicely:  floyd: "i've been wondering, how did a girl like you get mixed up in a thing like this in the first place."  dr. van horn: "i suppose you think that women should only cook and sew and bear children."  floyd: "isn't that enough?" i think floyd should have stayed behind with the cavemen!

to call "rocketship x-m" a science fiction classic is due more to its release date (1950), its savvy ability to capitalize on the publicity for "destination moon", and the appearance of actors who would later star in television as sea hunt's mike nelson, rockford's dad and wyatt earp.the movie itself is bad enough to be good fodder for mst3k and is best viewed with commentary from joel and the robots. this is the type of movie best suited to added riffing from the mst3k characters; something preachy, slow-paced, poorly scripted, and full of painfully bad acting. while unintentionally funny stuff like "plan 9 from outer space" don't lend themselves to satirical commentary (because the movie constantly upstages the hosts), really bad and dull movies like "rocketship x-m" are ideal. so add some stars to the rating if you are watching the mst3k version.the basic story has the crew taking an unplanned right turn at the moon and ending up on mars. what they find on that planet are the remnants of a human-like civilization devastated by an atomic war. only one martian is shown in close-up, a normal looking woman who is blind or at least has no pupils in her eyes. the men look like the "goons" in the old popeye cartoons, they scamper agilely around the cliffs and throw boulders at the crew with amazing accuracy-especially if they are supposed to be blind. of course none of this is ever explained as doing so would require some sign of logical analysis from the writers of the screenplay.the scenes on mars are presented in something called "sepia color" to distinguish them from the rest of the b&w movie. if this has you thinking "wizard of oz" you will be disappointed because it is just black and white stuff with a slight brown tint added to the print in post-production.in keeping with the moronic sexism of the movie, the icy female scientist screws up her fuel calculations-both coming and going. her failure to measure up to the men causes her feminine side to surface and she and mike nelson coo sweetly to each other as they face their doom (insert sound of gagging here).the real stars of the movie are the reporters at the command center. so much so that mst3k was inspired to specially salute these unheralded heroes. the intrepid squad of "newsies" are featured for the first 10 minutes of the movie, then take stations about 12 inches behind the technicians and monitoring equipment in the command center. later they are called upon to ask the moronic questions needed by the mission director to expound on the movie's already too obvious message.the dvd has an extremely low audio level, is not captioned, and is accompanied by a trailer. although you will be thankful that it is only 77 minutes, it is still about 60 minutes too long as any 30 minute episode of "the twilight zone" has several times more content than this entire movie.then again, what do i know? i'm only a child.

although it can be very tedious at times, this movie is really not all that bad. the acting is fairly well done, if stereotypical, and the production values are pretty high considering some of the sci-fi movies that were to come later in the decade.my biggest problem with this film are some of the very outdated characterizations in it. there's the guy from texas, the "professional" scientist, and worst of all the woman scientist who finally realizes her womanhood. for a film seeking to make a statement about mankind, it loses some of it's impact by reducing its characters through sexist stereotypes.

i bought "rocketship x-m" on dvd in a two-pack with "destination moon." now i see why the distributors did that: no one who had ever seen this movie would buy it on its own.i cannot fathom what school system turned out the reviewer who claimed that rxm is "great in its predictions of how space travel would take place..." launch straight up, and then do a 90-degree right turn and circle faster and faster until you reach escape velocity... i don't think i recall that from the apollo program. never mind that the astronauts should be weightless once they shut off the engines, gravity changes directions every time they pass through the hatch to the engine room. going to the moon, but "missed" it? no problem, it's just a hop-skip-and-a-jump (with a helping hand from divine providence) and you'll be at mars! and ok, if you want to put life on mars, given the state of planetary knowledge in 1950, it was a forgivable convention for the sake of the storytelling, but can you make them look at least a little alien? these martians looked like extras from the cast of "10,000 b.c." i can accept some scientific mistakes, but this wouldn't pass muster with an above-average second-grader.and that's aside from the screaming plot holes: 12 minutes before launch (as you're reminded of constantly by the nagging p.a. voice saying "x minus so many minutes") the astronauts are giving a press conference! i guess the time crunch is why dr. eckstrom didn't change out of his coat and tie before launching into space. and how handy that, even though they were planning to go to the moon and had pressure suits for that, they brought hiking gear (and rifles!) just in case they ended up at mars. they're lucky they landed anywhere, since apparently the method they had developed for landing was to have dr.e look out the window and tell the "pilot" (lloyd bridges) to tweak down the throttles every now and then. note to the designers of the xm-2: how about giving the pilot a window seat? ditto the previous comments on the casual sexism that had eye-candy dr. lisa (osa massen) doom them all by repeatedly screwing up her fuel calculations, but hey that was the early '50s. she was there to fill her sweater, not a useful function."rocketship x-m" is notable for being one of the first of the first films to say "ohmigod we're all going to blow ourselves up with these here a-bombs", but one can note that about it without wasting 77 minutes watching such dreck. by the way, that message might have had a bit more impact had there been some money in the budget for actual sets of the martian city ruins, rather than just matte paintings.i can appreciate "good" bad sci-fi, for the unique way the "future" used to look, and for the inherent (if condescending) humor you can find when when we look back on the naivety of audiences 60 years ago, but this film must have been insulting even then. "rocketship x-m" isn't even suitable for an mst3k-style lampooning. sometimes, bad is just... bad.anybody want to buy a dvd? used only once, i swear.

minor spoilersfirst i must say how rare and charming it is to find a movie with such basic messages in it: nuclear war will inevitably destroy all of civilization, and women are for making babies. it is absolutely incredible how well formulated the plot is to hit in these two points, as with a golden hammer. essentially, everything about this movie annoyed me. the casual sexism, the character whose sole trait was coming from texas, the mysterious choice of dying mars orange, and of course the flawed science of it all. then the martian woman screaming as if she had just noticed that she was blind? what was that? however, i will give it credit. the fifties did spit out some sillier things. but not much...

wow, this was a real stinker. this early sci-fi flick has nothing going for it than pure camp. there's so much scientific mambo-jumbo in the dialog it's laughable. the female character played by osa massen is just a plot device for the male characters to serve sexist remarks during the entire length of the film. watch this one with your girlfriend i guarantee it will make her blood boil.the only good thing is the musical score which expertly build the moods of the film. the special-effects are rather crude but not bad considering the vintage of the movie. with some good b-stars in the lead roles,the acting isn't too bad. but the lines they are given must have given them quite a challenge. the challenge of not laughing their heads off.

i like this movie and have watched my copy twice since acquiring it a few weeks ago. but you have to view it in the right context.i haven't checked on the dates, but i bet this movie came out after and certainly around the same time as the collier and walt disney popularisations of the vision of spaceflight being promoted by w.von braun. this is reflected in the attempt to seem factually correct and scientific. however, whilst certain ideas are put across ( step boosters, for example ) roughly correctly, other things are hilariously wrong.for example, we are told that a rocket ascends to an altitude and then turns ninety degrees to enter space...like reaching the top of a flight of stairs and turning onto the landing! then we are told that by turning in the direction of the earths rotation the total velocity of the ship is increased accordingly.this is an hilarious misunderstanding of what really happens. most space launch centres are located as near the equator as possible where the earth and anything on its surface is rotating at roughly a thousand miles per hour, including any rocket departing to space, in an eastward direction ( the same as the rotation of the planet ). of course, if the ship turned to travel westwards once in space, its speed in relation to the surface of the earth would be greater, but it would add nothing to the actual velocity of the vehicle. decsribed in this movie as "air speed"! similarly, we are told that the travellers only feel free-fall, or "weightlessness" when they reach some thousands of miles from the earth, outside of the planets gravitational field. again, comically incorrect. most crewed spacecraft travel no higher than a couple of hundred miles up, but as long as they ( and, their contents, including crew ) are travelling at an adequate velocity that their momentum in an outward direction balances the pull of gravity inwards, they will orbit in free-fall. of course, travel far enough from earth and even a slow object will coast outside the earths gravity well, but in order to leave earth orbit, outwards ( towards the moon for example ) requires the attainment of "escape velocity", around twenty one thousand miles per hour. so the vehicle will have already attained "orbital velocity" ( and "weightlessness" ) by definition.but the movie has vastly more hilarious stuff than this. someone decided it would be more fun if they missed the moon due to a technical problem, fell asleep for a few days and then woke up to find they had accidentally gone to mars! the captain then ruminates to the effect that this must have been divine intervention! at which point, any pretence to being scientific is torn into little pieces like confetti and thrown upon the wind amid the merry dance of an increasingly barmy plot.the strength of a film like this in fact is in illustrating "how far we've come". not least in attitudes to women. the patronising drivel heaped upon the female crew-member is both hilarious and also shocking.to think that such attitudes were so recently "normal".as i said at the start, i find this film very entertaining, as a late night, lights out romp through the romance of travel in outer space, from the perspective of the days before it had actually happened. an antidote to the cold routine of spaceflight as it has now become in the twenty first century.i won't reveal the ending. it is both brave and shocking for a movie of this vintage and character.

i first saw this when it came out in the theater. though only 13 at the time, i was an avid reader of "hard science" science fiction stories. the technical gaffes of the film are burned into my memory.some of the following may have significant spoilers.even as a youngster, i knew the premise is silly. the rocket takes off for a lunar mission, in a cosmos where there is always a gravitational effect on the crew (though loose objects float as in zero gravity) and because of that, the "cabin" (the area with the controls, whatever they called it) was gyrostabalized to maintain the "correct" orientation (so that when they landed, why didn't they land standing on their heads?) and where, at least in near-earth space, the rocket engines had to be running continually -- with propellant combusting away without an oxidizer. when the engines quit, the rocket stopped _dead_ in space, and couldn't start going until a phd chemist determined it needed at a little oxidizer. this time, the rocket recalled it had momentum, and the next thing our heroes know they're near mars (even a 13-year-old nerd knew such a minimum-energy trip would take over 200 days).they land, find the air was breathable (though at the time scientific data revealed that the pressure, even if the atmosphere were pure oxygen, would be too low to do any good). they decide to camp outside the ship, and even build a campfire. they come armed, even though they were supposedly going to the moon, where firearms wouldn't be needed.they get a sight of a collapsed civilization, encounter stray martians who look just like people, develop an anti nuclear war philosophy, and those who survive try to get back to the home planet, and die in the attempt by crashing on the earth! to do that would require such a long orbital period, they'd have died of starvation long before approaching their destination.the film it preceded, destination moon, used real science most effectively (even though their "rescue" with the oxygen tank forgot about the moment arm from the tank's center of gravity to the output nozzle). this film showed woeful ignorance of even the most basic science. only the most technologically illiterate should think of it as a science fiction film: it's on a par with the old flash gordon serials where their rocketships took off from their bellies and climbed in spirals, and whose engines were always on.the story on this one i considered banal, and i can recommend this only as a film to be shown to students for them to pick out technical gaffes.

rocketship x-m should be viewed by any serious movie buff for the following reasons:1) it is one the first -- and the few -- movies not to have a happy ending. doubtless the effect was more profound in post-world war ii america than it would be today, but nonetheless the sad ending adds to the film's message.2) it is also one of the first movies to deal with space travel in a serious fashion, using space as a valid setting for drama. the lack of scientific background notwithstanding, the movie stands on its own as dramatic fare. it's not so much a space drama as it is a drama set in space.3) the anti-nuclear war message is delivered in a serious manner that is not lost in sfx involving large grasshoppers, men, or animal. the effect of martian society from nuclear devastation is starkly and frankly presented. the fact that the survivors from the expedition crash land and as such are unable to preach the lesson learned on mars adds another element of sadness to the tragic ending.sterno says take a ride on rocketship x-m.

there is a phrase by the experimental filmmaker nathaniel dorsky, who says some films are structured like a camera mounted on the head of a dog who goes down an alley, sniffing everything along the way.that's how this movie is. the structure is "kurosawa started out as a baby, then he became a kid, then a young man, then a movie director, then he started making 'masterpieces', then he grew old, the end." the word 'masterpiece' is used a lot in this film to describe kurosawa's output, without explaining *what* makes his films so good/great. just because the off-screen narrator reading a script says that a film is a masterpiece, are we supposed to kiss his rear-end and accept that a certain movie is one of the great works of art of the 20th century? and one more point. the voice of paul scofield is used as the voice of kurosawa, when excerpts from the director's memoirs are being read off screen. he brings pear-shaped shakespearean tones to the text...but why him?? if you were making a documentary about billie holiday, would you use dame judi densch as her voice????

on the cusp of being insufferable. somehow i stayed just slightly interested, but was it because i truly wanted to know what the "secret" was (which, i should say, is pretty damned obvious) or because i hoped scarlett johansson would put on a more sexy outfit? this movie is poor and what's more it's a disgrace to all the lonely, alcoholic southern literature professors out there. travolta wants his oscar so bad he is willing to cry drunkenly in the bathroom after urinating blood. sorry, pal. . .you were more believable is "staying alive." not everyone can pull a peter fonda in "ulee's gold." if you want the against-type brave anti- hero oscar you have to, um, actually act. . .not just pout on screen. stop this director before he/she (name is vague on gender) directs again!

the director does not know what to do with a camera... too many options and she always always always picks the wrong one... she let travolta take charge... and he controls the movie from the beginning to the end... the characters are not developed... maybe because we need to watch them singing... no pace at all, sometimes too fast sometimes too slow... miscasted: travolta ok... johansson, she is too grown up to be a 18... even if she is really 20...the happy ending? well it looks like that there must be one, so the story is sad but not too sad... travolta doesn't know how to play a guitar but the director doesn't look she cares too much that he is totally out of synch... the idea is the only thing that is great... but how she developed it? well, it is simply full of stereotypes and lines heard too many times...too bad, another missed chance...

this overheated southern gothic "mellerdramer" has a few decent moments --but is too often spoiled by a novice director piling cliché upon cliché, and a star who apparently decided to take it upon himself to turn the picture into his personal showcase, rather than allowing writer/director gabel to update inge or williams as a sort of contemporary "midnight cowboy" meets "lolita" tearjerker.close your eyes, listen to the exaggerated southern accents, and try to decide if you're witnessing a feature film, or an acting class -- full of eager amateurs. johansson is for once tolerable (i.e. less pouty than usual) -- though by no means good, macht is decent, though a little too pretty-boy cute to be believed, and travolta chews the scenery as never before (with the help of a decent editor and some directorial restraint, his performance might have been really touching; as it is, he -- and almost everyone else -- is too unlikable to ever move us past the point of boredom or revulsion). kara unger is perhaps best of all; had her role been developed beyond a few lines, she might have even found herself with a best supporting actress nomination. pic is almost saved by leonard cohen-style growling theme song, decent production design and locations, and continual reference to literary works (which has earned the otherwise standard screenplay reviews such as "poetic.") also helpful are a few old pros in the cast like sonny shroyer, and perhaps most importantly, soderbergh cameraman elliot davis -- whose fine work will no doubt be credited to the first-time director, who, ten or twenty years from now, may actually learn how to direct.but probably not.

this movie is an incredibly self-indulgent character piece that assumes that the mere impression of a story is as good as an actual story. it was utterly painful to watch and had i not been suckered in to buy the dvd because of john travolta and the positive buzz, i would not have finished watching it.this film lacks anything resembling an interesting premise and seems to rely on weighty (and frankly, heavy-handed) characterization. there is one altercation scene between purslane and bobby long in which a tv is destroyed that, when played out, is incredibly flaccid and ill-timed.i found myself caring less and less about the characters as i watched it. it was probably very fun, film-school-wise, to make it. but it is just awfully boring to watch. a indulgent and pretentious film school project you should not waste money on.

what a waste. john travolta and scarlett johansen deserved better than this. to start at the beginning, jt was horribly miscast in the lead here. the role called for someone who could convince as a broken-down anti-hero, someone who could look haunted and defeated. billy bob thornton would have fit the bill, or even al pacino, but jt is just too alive, and looks to be having too much fun. also, surely someone who has been through the mill to the extent jt's character had would have suffered some physical effects? the character presented to the audience looked as if he could start as tight end for the oakland raiders. scarlett faired little better role-wise. where was the pain and conflict of what should surely have been troubling development? and as for the "plot" ... well, none of it makes sense. the characters leap from one frame of mind to another seemingly without cause - and certainly without explanation. the pace of the film also leaves something to be desired, namely, pace. this is a very slow film, not that i have anything against slow films, as long as they are heading somewhere. the pace only picks up towards the very end, when it shifts from a slow dirge to a frantic race to pack in as many tired clichés as possible. in this it succeeds - the only thing missing being something involving a small dog. 3 out of 10 for this one purely for gabriel macht's performance - he was the only member of the cast who was a) well cast and b) able to convince in his role. all in all, a terrible disappointment and a real waste of a couple of hours.

i attended a screening of this film. travolta came to do a q & a after the film ended. it was a small screening room in tribeca. out of courtesy to him i did not walk out which i wanted to do. this is film-making at its worst. to start the script was poorly written. the writer writes in one voice. the dialogue was stilted and clichéd. how this writer/director got scarlet johansen, john travolta and lions gate entertainment to back her on this is the only brilliant thing she accomplished in this fiasco.i do in fact recommend this film to all aspiring screenwriters, directors and filmmakers. because when you are told that you are wasting your time and it will be impossible for you to reach your goals. hey...just look at this crap and say to yourself...if they can make this then anythings poosible.ps- travolta did a great q&a though...he was at ease, spoke freely and was a down to earth nice guy. the director/writer stood on the sidelines. when john tried to engage her in the conversation she stood back like a piece of wood and never joined in. i looked at her and i thought...how was this person able to successfully "pitch" to agents, studio execs, top talent ...when she can't open her mouth at a screening of her own film. the conclusion from a few of us in attendance was that she must have strong family connections in the business.after you watch this you should follow it with guy ritchie's zero star masterpiece "swept away" with the most unintentionally funny and worst performance by wife madonna. she's so bad and looks so bad in this film i figure this was her his way of getting back at her for all the abuse he takes from her at home.

veber is not renown for his outstanding directorial skills. in fact nobody cares as long as they got the laughs, quite a few here to be honest, scattered in the whole process, thanks to depardieu's half-wit characterization and the dialogue veber puts in his mouth.but this is not enough to make a great comedy since there's no movie outside of the usual veber premise: a tough guy is doomed to team up with a very naive character. in l'emmerdeur, la chèvre or les compères there was a real story going on over the fire vs. water proceedings. le diner de cons, although it was a play, managed to create a real suspense about the next catastrophe pinon would cause. in tais-toi the backstory about the vengeance is both redundant and too weak to arouse our interest. plus the heavies are lame both on screen and in the script.now what's wrong? veber wraps this up creating no action, no rhythm. instead he uses systematically and overuses ellipses (maybe he met william goldman in hollywood) and the 'music' really stresses that lack of nerve and a backbone in the story.so you'll have to be content with depardieu's performance.

reading the other two comments, i had to wonder if i had seen the same movie!perhaps life is drastically different in australia, but, wow - call it sci-fi or fantasy, but people just don't act like this.i couldn't pass up this review without commenting on it myself.. it gets better after the first half hour, but i doubt most could make it that far..yikes.

the parallels between this film and "captain walrus" (an independant film shown at the team projection film festival in 1994) are so blindingly obvious that any praise for "sally marshall is not an alien" must be viewed with the knowledge that it is riding on the success of another work.in captain walrus, two young boys (geoff and roger, played by dean turner and brett allen respectively) examine the bizarre behaviour of their new neighbour britney (played by louise farley). as the two boys watch through their telescope, they observe the repeated visits of a man in uniform who they call captain walrus (played by peter sargent). however, the emphasis in captain walrus is on the pointless and somewhat power-hungry actions of the neighbour britney, and less on the friendship between the two boys.a critical success at the film festival, the plot of captain walrus has obviously been appropriated and rehashed in order to give the australian film community another notch on the belt with regards to children's product. although sally marshall is not an alien is a fine film, and a credit to its producers, its inauthenticity leaves something to be deserved.

in the past 5 years i have rented some bad movies...completely on purpose. see i aspire to be a movie reviewer, and as we all know there are horrible movies released every year. anyway, about 3 months ago i rented this one. i watched it all the way through...and cried profusely. this is one of those movies that is so freakin bad it makes you want to puke. it actually put a sick feeling in my stomach. i've seen lots of bad movies (mystery science theater 3000 anyone?) but this one takes the cake. the plot was hard to follow, the lighting horrible and the sounds almost inaudible. if there was a negative rating on the scale here this movie would be at -11 for me. this may seem odd, but i highly recommend it. it's something you have to see for yourself...but don't say i didn't warn you. i don't think this review could get any more precise so i'm done now.

i've heard that this move was put together by a bunch of high-school students. as a high-school art or theatre project it's not too bad. unless you lived near milpitas in the seventies or knew someone involved in the making of the movie, this is pretty awful. most of the actors are clearly not actors, but locals who volunteered. bob wilkins (the original host of creature features on ktvu in oakland appears, but only for about a minute). some of the monster effects are done with stop motion animation and some with a man in a monster suit and each works okay on it's own, but there is no continuity between the two. watching without dialog, you'd assume that the movie had 2 monsters. i guess the most unsupportable aspect is that even the main characters, who i assume are the kids behind the movie, cannot even pretend to act. these kids must have been involved in theater in some way to want to do this project, but they display zero believable emotion in front of the camera.

this is the result of the town of milpitas california making a home movie and subjecting the rest of the world to it. legendary in some circles as the biggest cinematic turkey this movie is rightly thought of as a bad movie. part comedy, part giant monster horror movie this movie is full of non actors not acting. the plot has something to do with a giant monster being created from the garbage and pollution in the area and going on a rampage. the monster, which we don't see until the final 20 minutes, is rather cool looking but isn't cool enough to warrant watching the preceding hour of boredom. frankly even hardened bad movie lovers are going to have a tough time getting through to the end. this is a stinker.

it is real easy to toast, roast, flay, and otherwise burn this film for all of its abundant flaws. it was made by high school students and faculty and a whole community; it shows! sure, i could examine the script which is just ridiculous. a monster created from the garbage of a growing californian city starts eating garbage and taking garbage cans all over the city. soon this huge beast with wings no less begins to destroy buildings and even plays the "beauty and the beast" act with a young high school girl. fortunately for her there is a gang of guys, her former boyfriend nicknamed "the penguin," and the town drunk out to help her. the direction is awful, the production values just dreadful, the acting non-existent, and the pace sluggish. the movie is hard to sit through - period. however, that being said, it is also a miracle of a film when you consider that this thing was crafted by an entire community. you can see all the collective effort from the actors, the actual mayor and actual firemen and policemen, to the area location shots used. i also was really amazed at all the local businesses credited at the film's end with helping to finance or contribute in some way to the film. when you look at the film from that perspective, it is indeed quite an achievement. i didn't know anything about it before i sat down and watched it. now that i have found out something about it, i am impressed. but make no mistake - i have no...no...desire to sit through it again.

this is a very bad movie. however, i read that it was made by a high-school teacher so maybe i should give it at least a tiny bit of praise for it's ambitious (yet awful) special effects. here is the plot: a monster emerges from a pile of trash and pollution in the town of milpitas, california and embarks on a destructive rampage. i'm about to spoil the "big surprise" about what the monster looks like, so please read the rest of this at your own risk. you have been warned! the monster looks sort of like a giant, two-legged fly wearing a gas mask. in some scenes, the monster is an actor wearing a costume. in other scenes, the monster is created by stop-motion animation. the acting is terrible. the dialogue is terrible. the special effects are terrible. the plot is predictable. stay away!

i'm giving it a three instead of the lower number it deserves because of its history. a full-length movie made by high school students! it shows, too, but that's part of the charm and appeal. get ahold of some of the stuff george lucas did at ucla; this is better. maybe due to being a group effort.a monster made of toxic waste and too much garbage--these kids were way ahead of their time!--starts ravaging the town of milpitas during a high school dance. the monster destroys randomly, leaving garbage and smelly footprints.the movie has local tv and radio people, the milpitas mayor, the samuel ayer high school principal, and a whole bunch of the high school students and their parents, not to mention the mayor's daughter as the ingénue.dumb? yeah! fun? yeah! great screen writing? c'mon, they're untrained high schoolies! copy that comment for the acting, cinematography, directing, et cetera.milpitas is right next to san jose in the heart of silicon valley; maybe one of the graphics geniuses there will update the video somehow. now there's a challenge.

if corky st. claire in waiting for guffman had directed the citizens of blaine in a horror movie with comic undertones the result would have been very much like the milpitas monster.to be generous, this was the longest hour and twenty minute movie i've ever seen. to call the pace glacial is to be kind.almost nobody associated with this project ever made another movie with the exception of ben burtt, who did the really admirable (considering the budget) special effects. he went on to do sound for movies like munich and several other big budget projects. the narration is by veteran voice-over actor paul frees, who probably donated his efforts.when you're watching the opening titles and see the milpitas unified school district listed as one of the producers you know you're going on a long, strange trip.pollution at the down dump in milpitas, california, becomes so toxic that it creates a monster. remember that this is 1975 and ecology was a hot topic. just a few years previously moviegoers had been treated to godzilla vs. the smog monster.so far so good. the monster is a winged creature at least fifty feet tall and has the capacity to tear the town apart. instead it steals garbage cans.central to the premise is the idea that this monster can prowl a small city and leave eight foot long footprints behind but not be noticed by anyone. there's a nicely conceived scene where it walks through the middle of a carnival at night but somehow nobody notices.the only person who sees the monster until the final scenes is george, the town drunk. all through the movie i hoped, hoped, hoped that george would be torn to shreds on camera but this didn't happen. drat. in fact, nobody gets killed. george supposedly sacrifices himself to save priscilla (he's tied to a helicopter to lure the creature- george smells worse than garbage and the monster is attracted to the scent).the nominal leads are a group of high school students. there's pretty priscilla and her nondescript boyfriend and some "bad" boys who (surprise, surprise) whip themselves into shape to help defeat the monster in the final scenes.the monster is involved in four main set pieces. he attacks a browning-ferris garbage truck and leaves it beside an elevated highway, but nobody notices. he walks through the carnival, again unnoticed. he tears up a building (nice miniature work) and nobody sees him but george. then he attacks the high school during a dance and grabs priscilla and carries her off just like a certain very tall ape has done several times, most recently this past winter.there are plot ideas that come out of nowhere and are dropped. local citizens picket at city hall because they want their garbage cans back. an elaborate secret weapon for tracking monsters is flown in by private jet, examined, and forgotten.so why did i watch the whole thing? because these people were having so darned much fun. i had the idea that the firemen were firemen, the businessmen were being filmed in their own offices, priscilla may well live in that suburban tract house, and scenes of people in their yards may well have been in their own yards.they may not be great actors, but they are real people. nobody is stunningly good looking. in fact, i'd estimate that four out of five of the adults on screen wear glasses. since this is the mid seventies we see some really bad clothes and some of the men have awesomely bad facial hair. one dignitary being interviewed before a meeting at ciry hall has such a loud tie and sportcoat that you think he's on his way to play marcellus in the music man.and that got the movie two extra stars. zero for the story. two points for the sometimes decent special effects. and two points for the fact that people in the community actually got together and did this. they can actually say they've performed in a movie; despite lots of stage experience and working behind the scenes in live television i can't say that, and i'm happy for them.remember those great old movies with mickey rooney and judy garland? at some point somebody would say, "let's put on a show! aunt edna has all those old clothes in the attic, and we can use uncle ned's barn!" then they'd do 'neighborhood shows' with sets and costumes that would cost well into seven figures if duplicated today.that's the spirit that the good people of milpitas had for this project, and bless them for that.

so this guy goes into a psychiatrist's office for his first appointment. after the paperwork is done, the psychiatrist says "i'm going to show you ink blots. tell me what you see in them." "well, says the patient," looking at the first one, "i see a man and a woman having sex." on seeing the second one, he says "i see two women having sex." on seeing the third, he says "i see two men having sex." on seeing the next one, he says "i see two men and two women having sex." the psychiatrist puts down the the inkblots. "so," he says, "we'll start by discussing your monomania." "my monomania?" says the guy. "and you with all these dirty pictures!" that's how this movie strikes me.

i classify this as the worst movie of all time.if there ever was a movie i would wish upon my enemies, this would be it. the plot is ridiculous, there are only 2 characters, and the coincidences between these characters just completely strain belief.these factors combined to make this an extremely boring movie.my wife and mother walked out on the movie about 15 minutes in. i figured that a movie this boring and slow *must* have some cool interesting plot twist, and a was quite disappointed when nothing exciting materialized.i briefly considered sending the filmmakers a bill for my 2 hours of lost life.

this is possibly the hands down worst movie every made, that actually took itself seriously. and not as a result of the acting, because being an actor, i have to say that rickman and stowe had to be at their best, just to escape needing electro convulsive therapy after the principle photography wrapped. being one of the 57 people that actually saw this movie in theatrical release, i have to say i have never before or since experienced a movie where the movie ended, credits rolled, the house lights went on, and no one moved from their seats. about five minutes after the house lights went up people started coming out of their comas to look around, and i think most of us thought, okay we get it, that was a joke, right?, they are going to show the real movie now. eventually, after the ushers handed out disguises, and we swore an oath of secrecy to never admit we were there, we felt that it was safe to leave, praying that we would not be seen leaving the auditorium. i have seen some pretty bad movies in my day, (i have cinemax for goodness sakes), but i am still bitter that i will never, ever be able to recover those two or so hours of my life that i lost watching closet land.

closet land is a nasty piece of work with superb actors. nothing more (or less) happens in the movie besides the unending abuse of an attractive woman prisoner by a sadistic police official. the setting is minimalist. this might be considered soft core s&m porn because the drama is devoid of all reference points such as time, place, and political context. since what happens is cut adrift in a fantasy futuristic environment, the abuse becomes purely personal. the pornographic aspects are justified by being a warning about the evils of totalitarian government, but because there is no real context for the torture of this young woman, we come away disturbed but having learned nothing.what is the point? that torture exists in the world? that abusing prisoners is bad? that dictatorships abuse innocent people? we know that already. closet land has echoes of such works as darkness at noon and ionesco's rhinoceros, but both those works were made by competent artists whose work had historical context and depth of meaning. this work is amateurish and the dialogue sophomoric. a definite thumbs down.

this movie includes 2 well known actors i have previously enjoyed watching. there actions are great and each action is heart felt. but it makes me think these 2 were thrown into a speech/drama class at college for the first time and told for one to act dominating and constricting to the other in a room without allowing her to leave and the woman to be truly innocent and treat her with enough mind-humping to drive the audience into tears for her release.the only good part is the acting abilities, the plot has the same ruse as hitlers influence and i started to hate the protagonist for that. but all of this could have been done within 15 minutes in my opinion, so to drag it out for over an hour was just pure punishment for all who watched it.

the best scene of "the people across the lake" is the genuinely creepy, nightly opening-scene featuring a house, a murder & a lake. after that, it's pretty much downhill from there on as far as the horror is concerned. a family (mom, dad, sister & younger brother) is fed up with the (mildly) dangerous environment of suburbia, and decides to go and live near the titular lake. from then on, the film features too much lame happy family-related doo-doo near the lake, with occasionally some corpses popping up here and there. the couple of scenes where they discover the bodies, are pretty convincing (in terms of creepiness), but they are in shrill contrast with the rest of the goings-on (featuring just every-day-life stuff of the family settling in). the truth to the matters (the mystery as to who's doing the killing) is learned too soon, leaving only the family unknowing and the viewer yawning during the unexciting finale (featuring a discovery in a basement and running around the house), like if this made-for-tv thing suddenly remembered it was supposed to be a horror film. it's not really badly made; the content & story is just not interesting enough. the only highlight in the cast is barry corbin, though his performance/character is just a bit too goofy to be taken serious. blond cutie tammy lauren (the daughter) might be a recognisable face for avid horror junkies too, as she also starred in "wishmaster" (1997), and made-for-tv outings like "i saw what you did" (1988) & "the stepford children" (1987). she hasn't got much to do in this film, though. skippable, but watchable, if anything.

it's been over 30 years now but i still remember that this movie was the worst i've ever seen. i would have thought that in this length of time something worse would have been filmed but i was mistaken. i just finished watching "starship troopers" and it came mighty close but it was still more entertaining than " poor cow ".

now, i loved "lethal weapon" and "kiss kiss bang bang", but i cannot believe shane black wrote this pile...or that david morse and john c. mcginley are in it. i screened it for a film festival. awful. everyone was laughing. it's preachy and heavy handed...not to mention stupid. also, it's surprising how little l.a. looks like cambodia. the entire idea of time traveling through post-traumatic stress disorder is kinda dumb. imagine "born on the fourth of july" mixed with "the butterfly effect 2" (i used to sequel as the example to really show how bad this movie is) but directed by michael bay's 2nd unit director. that bad. the 2 stars are purely based on the production value.

i have one word: focus.well.imdb wants me to use at least ten lines of text. okay. let's discuss the fine points of focus. i don't know about the rest of you, but in my first year of film school they taught us a lot of useless crap, like 'you'll all be famous avant-garde filmmakers someday'--but they also taught us how to do this crazy thing called focusing the lens! it was amazing! you give a little twist and wham! everything is clear as a bell. the person who shot what alice found needs to learn a few things about the finer points of focus. lighting, too. this movie is not only completely out of focus, it's also lit like the corner of someone's basement.don't even get me started on pacing or plot. they could have trimmed about ten seconds off the beginning and end of every single shot.but who cares about that anyhow? there is not enough lurid in this movie to make up for the utter lack of regard to film's best friends--focus, and lighting.words to the wise.

really, average is the only word that comes to my mind when you see this.the acting was average (maybe a bit above average), the camera usage was average (actually below average. the picture was so shaky and the colors were grainy and blurry.) the plot was a good one but moved at such a slow pace and wasn't put to good use.this could've been so much more if it didn't go at a snail pace and we saw more into the characters backgrounds.all we see are flashbacks here and there of alice and how her home life is so "bad" (her mother is a working class woman trying to make end meet for her and her daughter.) we see a flashback of her of when she was in high school and her friend says to her "tell your mom to make some better food" and "everybody says it's your mom." yeah that's embarrassing but why would you run away from it. i could definitely see if her mom was a drunk or somebody was abusing her but nothing was wrongwith her home except she was embarrassed by it. how immature! we're not even given a glimpse of what the couple's lives have been like (except that they've been prostituting for awhile and the woman, forgot her name, gave her baby up when it was 9 months old.) this really could've been so much more. it could've had alice who was abused by her drunk mom go down to florida with her friend but then becomes a prostitute. or something along the lines of that other then the real plot of this movie (that is) alice, a girl with a home life of probably 90% of america's population (working class) runaways to florida but then gets sidetracked by turning into a prostitute.i don't see why it won an award at sundance (it must've been up against some really weak competition to have won that one award.) also to me, alice's boston/new england accent seemed forced. it didn't seem genuine. (i should know, i was born and raised in boston, but now live in georgia.) 4/10 not really worth your time in my opinion.

this is one of those movies i watched, and wondered, why did i watch it? what did i find so interesting about it? being a truck driver myself, i didn't find it very realistic. no, i've never used a 'lot lizard', nor have i ever seen, nor heard about one traveling around the country in a brand new seventy thousand dollar rv, either.same thing about a pimp whom has never sampled the lady in question (until the end of the movie, and well, he still really didn't...), and only getting 50 bucks 'a cut', when the prostitute gets $200.00 (well, $150.00 after his cut, yeah...).i still laugh at the lot lizard comment ivey made (them's lot lizards, they'll screw anything with 20 bucks, and some are men dressed as woman... or something equally as weird), meaning, we're better then them, as we may still be prostitutes, but we get paid better.other then that, it's just a story of a young woman whom wanted something more from life then a dead end job while living at home (she's 18, remember?) and embarrassed by her mother basically doing the same thing (dead end job). at least she had a roof over her head and a job. she turned five tricks on the road... i wonder if the $750.00 she made was worth it? i'd guess not.

kazuo komizu, who hasn't made one decent film, directed this "notorious" shocker and should be ashamed that it was a hit upon its japanese release.yes, it does feature scenes of rape, gore and dismemberment, but so what? it has the style of a bad american porn film shot and badly photographed by ed powers ("dirty debutantes") and is incredibly slow.it seems to have earned its notoriety based on its roster of anti-social acts.there is a huge difference between this and horror that is well produced.just because someone likes their cinema a little wet does not mean they'll accept crap like this. on the contrary, that kind of fan (myself, for example) tolerates even less crap than the average punter out there because he's seen so much and has become overly discerning. it's a shame production companies don't realize that.one reviewer here (zombiekilla81) commented that the film's "near obsession with gang rape" is one of the factors that killed it. i disagree. the subject matter is never the issue. the issue is how that subject matter is treated. in entrails of a beautiful woman, it is treated so unimaginatively that it is boring.personally, i like graphic depictions of psychopathic behavior (with an intriguing context) if the material is well directed, freshly photographed and aesthetically pleasing. this nikkatsu horror/pink hybrid is woeful.

this program was shown in an early morning time slot on space, a cable sci-fi station. i am amazed that anyone would pay for this or broadcast it; it is incredibly amateurish.the entire show is a sequence of short monologues or scenes performed on a set that looks like a closet with a bunch of circuit boards taped to the wall. there is very little continuity between scenes, and no plot. a typical scene revolves around some lame joke or special effect and is only a minute or so long. the dialog makes little sense and the special effects look like photoshop filters. the actors are all adults, but i have literally seen high-school plays with better writing and sets. this program is an embarrassment.perhaps each scene would work as an interstitial; a filler between shows instead of commercials. stringing all the scenes together makes the limitations of the material extremely obvious.

the opening of morte a venezia resembles a duran duran music video with classical music and this is the highlight of the movie " in terms of what theo ? " in terms of everything , but especially excitement . i doubt if there's ever been a more sluggish slower moving movie than this one . yeah okay it's a european art house movie so i wasn't expecting charles bronson to massacre hordes of bad guys but even so i did expect some substance if not an actual plot the film revolves around professor gustav von aschenbach visiting venice . gustav visits venice and goes on a gondola , gustav eats in an expensive restaurant , gustav looks out of his hotel window and if it's excitement you want gustav has a flashback bad enough if this was the entire movie but it gets worse because gustav notices a pretty boy teenager . so you've got a middle aged academic lusting after some teenage boy he has seen , some old queen is becoming obsessed with a stranger . great idea for a movie ? i don't think so either and thank gawd it remained a yawn fest instead of some sleazy precursor to gay porn i notice a lot of people who praise this movie have tried to intellectualise it . i can only be monosyllabic and unpretentious in my view and say that the only subtext i could relate to was the physical and emotional disintegration of gustav but it wasn't caused by the effete beauty of the teenage boy - it was caused by watching such a boring and ostentatious movie

i was entertained to see that some of the reviews here were topped with **spoilers** the joke in my family is that the only part of this movie that isn't given away on the back of the box, is given away in the title. perhaps i am just a dense american 17-year-old who wouldn't know art if it bit me in the leg, but i prefer movies that have at least some words. this movie makes the second half of 2001: a space odyssey down right chatty. this movie is just so slow it isn't even art, it is merely boring. we follow this creepy guy who is following this boy around venice. the end was incomprehensible until i read the end of book. a movie shouldn't make you refer back to the book, it should be able to stand alone. this movie has no way to stand. it doesn't even have the bones of a plot to lean on.

this...... movie.... is..... horrible!!!!!! you won't believe this hunk of junk is even a movie!!!! critters4 was better then this!!! and critters4 was pretty frigging bad too!!! a bunch of stupid teens crash in a desert, find an old run down bungalow, and end up fending off horrifically badly stop motion animated spiders. pardon my french, but the acting was bad as hell!!! the person who wrote this probably didn't even know what a spider is, because he had the spiders living in a colony serving an alien-queen-ripoff queen spider! spiders do not live in colonies!!!!!!!!! this "movie" is a piece of crud!!! at the end, the marines suddenly pop out of no where and kill all the spider without even being called!!!! if you see a copy of this movie at a video store, douse it in gasoline and throw a match at it!!!!

my wife and i watched this after dvr'ing it off of encore action this past week. it has to be the worst horror flick either of us had ever seen. predictable dialogue ( my wife and i were guessing the lines before they were spoken), hokey special effects, a screenplay that drifted all over the place. i think the part that was the most annoying was the stereotyping of the various characters in the plot, not to mention the gratuitous sex scene between two of the young heroines in the movie, neither of which had any real purpose other than to bare certain parts of their anatomy for the cameras. this movie should be categorized as comedy, not horror as the villains of the movie (spiders) were stop motion animated and not believable in the least. i can't say that i would have done a better job making a film myself, but it was very amateurish and wasn't even a "b" movie, somewhere closer to a "d" movie, or "f" if that is possible. i think even science fiction 3000 would have to pass on this one!

i usually love these movies. give me a good old b movie any day but this one was simply awful. the acting(?) was terrible almost to the point of my turning the movie off completely. i thought i saw the all time worst but this one is right up there with attack of the killer tomatoes! in all honesty - it was the acting that did this film in for me.i found the actor's to be clumsy and the lead male/female were extremely dull. this movie had absolutely nothing going for it. i may be asking a ridiculous question here but why the nudity and sex scene? did the producers think nobody would watch if they left them out? i think they were probably right! oh where is price and the tingler when you need them?

this is one of those movies that you watch because it's bad. such a movie that you watch just to see it's shitty craftsmanship. supposedly a horror, i cannot imagine how anyone can be afraid of a claymation bug, especially one that is translucent in nature where you can see the actor's legs behind it.even with no budget, a little bit of attention to detail and even an attempt at making this movie believable would have sucked the fun right out of it, as they would have had to replace all of the actors and the entire story with it. if i had nothing to make fun of while it was playing, i would have stopped it after 10 minutes, and put on some quality show like spunge bob square pants (har har har).i strongly recommend that brett piper get with quintin terrantino and really pump out some feces.:)

i watched this movie based on the comments of a few that said that is was bad but funny. but you need to be warned that this movie has the worst special effects ever produced. they make 1950s science fiction movies look like works of art. this is funny at times, but annoying for the most part. and to compound the problem with the seriously pathetic special effects is the total lack of logic that characterized a majority of the events depicted. one of my favorites is where three of the characters drop hundreds of feet into a tunnel created by the arachnia and arrive to find it fully lit. apparantely the arachnia have also managed to hook into the power grid. very impressive. but this is just one example. and for what its worth, the music sucks, the acting sucks, the two cute girls are annoying, the obnoxious guy is annoying, the so-called handsome lead man is a geek, and the black girl who fall for him is a fool. her father is the worst actor i have ever seen. i am not sure the brief moments of humor can possibly make up for the experience.

36/100. this is not to be confused with the decent arachnophobia, this film is a very low budget and cheap rip-off of that movie. this one is so bad, it actually does have some entertainment value on that level. there are numerous unintended (i think) laugh out loud scenes. i wasn't expecting much from the film, and it was actually worse than i had imagined it would be.it's a cliché ridden and predictable direct to video mess. fortunately, it doesn't take itself too seriously. the acting, as expected, is not quite oscar caliber. the special effects are poor, worse than i would have thought they would be. poorly edited and the score is intrusive.

i picked this up because, having spent time in the albany region of new york, i knew a couple of people in the movie and i happened upon it by chance. the attempts at comedy are lame, the compulsory girl-on-girl scene is sickening, the plot is nonexistent, the acting is among the worst i've ever seen, and don't even get me started on special effects. i realize this is a very low budget film made by a small independent company, but if you're going to do a sci-fi horror flick with giant bugs, don't make the giant bugs completely unbelievable. people want to see giant bugs. that's half the fun right there. and if you're going to make the giant bugs completely unbelievable, at least get the actors to make some sort of tongue-in-cheek allusion to that fact ("you idiots! these aren't them! you've captured their stunt doubles!"). be prepared to waste two hours of your life that you'll never be able to get back.

in a way, you have to respect arachnia. it's clearly meant as a tribute to the big bug movies of the fifties, and while the special effects look terrible; at least the film doesn't feature cgi. however, on the other hand; you can't respect the film too much because it's a load of rubbish. the acting is terrible, the special effects (as mentioned) are impossible to take seriously, and once you've seen one giant spider being blown up; you've seen them all, so it gets boring rather quickly. the plot follows a bunch of people who are unlucky enough to be in a plane crash after a meteor shower. they go to the only house in the area; which just happens to be a house where a man has a huge spider he used to use as a circus attraction. coincidently around the same time, the meteor shower has caused more giant spiders to rise from underground. all the characters in this film are poor caricatures; none of them have anything even resembling a third dimension and they will soon begin to thoroughly bore you. you've got to feel for director brett piper as he clearly didn't have much to work with for this film; but that doesn't make arachnia worth a damn, and overall there are better giant bug films than this, and therefore arachnia doesn't get the seal of approval from me.

angels and demons: 3 out of 10: clearly something bad has happened to ron howard. i don't know what exactly, but something has gone very wrong.howard has always been a decent workman director. while he will never be mistaken for an artistic savant both cinderella man and apollo 13 were excellent films, parenthood was pretty good and even angels and demons prequel/sequel the da vinci code was a fun romp. in addition none of his films have been downright awful. (note i have seen neither how the grinch stole christmas nor his newest film heidi montag says no to plastic.) whats more howard managed to hold this quality is such devise genres as star driven oscar bait (a beautiful mind), star driven costume drama (far and away), star driven revenge fantasy (ransom) and comedies about prostitution and mermaids (night shift, splash).angels and demons is at its center a poorly directed and shot film. scenes are too dark, camera angles are all wrong, the actors block each others shots and the whole affair is often out of focus. this makes the telling of an already confusing story even more muddled.dan brown gets picked on a lot but i found the da vinci code a fun readable romp (so sue me). the movie version of the da vinci code kept the same where are they going to next vibe of the book and added an attractive cast and attractive location shooting.angels and demons however takes place in the claustrophobic confines of vatican city and since howard wasn't allowed to film in many of the real locations we end up with a lot of running around a cgi back lot. the entire film is as if rick steves did a vatican city special and instead of actually visiting the holy city and pointing his camera, rick had to use lego bricks and a second hand art book with all the tits erased.while the da vinci code had what i still think is an intriguing central mystery (again sue me), demons and angels story consists of a plot by the illuminati (roll eyes now) to destroy the vatican. their idea was to take positions in schools for the deaf around the world and raping every student in the ass repeatedly. oops my bad; apparently the vatican doesn't need any help on that one.anyway their plan is to infiltrate europe's large hadron collider, kill the head priest, and steal three vials of anti-matter. this begs more than a few questions. can the hadron collider create anti-matter? can you capture the anti-matter once created? why is the eu collecting it? (perhaps they fear a godzilla attack?). why is the head of anti-matter gathering a vatican priest? now once they get the anti-matter they are going to use its incredible destructive power to take over the world no just kidding; unfortunately the illuminati haven't quite grasped that pinky and the brain level of sophistication just yet. instead the current pope has just died and it's conclave time. the top seeded cardinals for the final four pope tournament are all kidnapped and the illuminati are killing them one by one seven style. they being good sports however are leaving clues at every murder like some latin themed riddler. oh and the last kidnapped cardinal has the anti-matter and if he isn't found in time rick steves will have to go straight to venice next year to see decent frescoes. if only there was some latin themed batman to save the day? okay the story is truly awful and it is poorly told, but maybe this is one of those films saved by great performances. a true character study (okay you know where this is going). tom hanks gives an incredibly wooden performance and simply looks awful (he is also to old to play the character by about twenty years. ) his love interest israeli actress ayelet zurer has zero chemistry with either hanks or the screen. ewan macgregor plays the pope's personal assistant/cabana boy as an irish man who looks like he is about to break into a musical number at any moment providing no one steals his lucky charms.on the plus side stellan skarsgård puts in a fine turn as head of vatican security and as far as we know no deaf children were raped during the making of this film which puts it ahead of its vatican critics in at least one area.

oh mr. carell! how far you've fallen! after a glowing moment in little miss sunshine, steve carell's choice of films is beginning to contrast starkly with what has come since. although the 40 year old virgin was entertaining, it was dwarfed by his "sunshine" character. hoping to find something that'd get me to spew popcorn from my nose, i decided to rent evan almighty and see what possible guffaws might await me here. not much...given the trite and clichéd script, the entire film felt forced and unemotional. poking a bit of fun at flagging family values and the current u.s. administration's take on the environment, evan almighty also tries to put a profound biblical moment into humorous terms but fails miserably.nearly every person on earth knows the story of noah and the ark. god's wrath was sent down with 30 days and nights of rain which flooded the entire planet while noah, his family, and two of each of his creatures on earth rode out the wetness in relative comfort via the gopher wood ark. it was a huge moment in human history (if you believe the biblical text).so why would god appear to one man and ask him to build an ark that would only carry the world's animals for a few minutes after a dam break? the simple answer is that he never would. too much emphasis was given to u.s. government policy and not enough on world events, making evan almighty a terribly myopic and ameri-centric film. although designed as a comedy, it really never reaches anything approaching belly laughs. maybe a few grunts and a smile, but little else.john goodman (cars) pulls in another forced performance as the despicable congressman chuck long who's only goals are to create development opportunities on protected national land holdings. even the strong presence of morgan freeman (10 items of less) as god can't help mop up this soaking wet disaster-of-a-film.the only funny moments are between carell and the animals, especially as evan learns what animal magnetism is really like. birds literally flock to him. sheep herd around him. lions take pride in being near him (please forgive the puns).the special effects were fun to watch but were brief (with good reason). the "flood" was interesting in that the ark was obviously guided by his hand and shoved in just the right direction.but other than that you're in for little more than an insult to common sense and intellect.

the only way i can feel good about having handed over these precious minutes of my life is everyday telling someone how awful it was. and even if i say it once a day, every day for the rest of my life i will not fully get my point across. just dumb.there's a difference in movies like this and movies like elephant or fat guy goes nutzoid, two of my other least favorite movies. the latter two were terrible, yes, but that was that. evan almighty takes a strong cast and attempts to kill them all. wanda sykes, jonah hill, john goodman and steve carrell...why god why!? all these people have much better talent, now every time i see any of them i will think of this terrible movie.the only reason i gave this a 2 instead of a 1 was when i saw the movie, there was a mentally challenged elderly woman who thought the barrage of bird poop and getting-hurt-by-tools-while-building jokes were so funny that she didn't stop laughing the entire time, nearly stroking out at several times.

this certainly isn't a comedy - i don't know what it was marketed that way. as a serious movie, it lacks any sort of substance. unless you're fresh out of sunday school or needing your noah fix, you'll find yourself bored to tears.the supporting cast took away from what little of the movie was left. lauren graham plays an empty housewife with no real depth. his children don't really add anything to the movie. they seem to be around solely to brood about their absent father at the beginning. jonah hill plays a creepy internet addict that doesn't come off as humorous. i found the original to be a decent movie. disappointed that this one didn't really go anywhere.

the only redeeming feature of this movie is steve carell. like john wayne, i've never seen steve carell stretch too far as an actor, but it doesn't matter. he always plays his one role perfectly.as marty feldman once said, comedy must have internal consistency. you can have 4 men on stage sitting in garbage cans, and that's fine, but if you bring a fifth man on stage who isn't in a garbage can, you must then explain to the audience why he is not also in a garbage can.why doesn't evan accept his role as a messenger of god? why, when he does accept it, is he so profoundly embarrassed by it? why isn't anyone more impressed with the way that animals follow evan around (they are explained away by the unthinking doubters as "trained animals" possibly from a circus). there's a terrible flood at the end, and most everyone we see hops on the ark and is saved, but surely thousands of people would have been killed by the flood; there is no post-disaster emotional atmosphere at the end. instead, most of congress has finally seen the light and is about to prosecute the lone incorrigibly bad congressman for "profiteering".i gotta admit: i also liked the fish in the aquarium reacting to the presence of evan.

if like me, you enjoyed the first film "bruce almighty", my advice to you is not to get your hopes up too high; in fact disregard any hope you possess for this movie if you are above the age of 12 and have any film-sense at all.without giving too much away, the story sees evan (bruce's nemesis co-anchor from the first film) move home with his family to the virginian suburbs to "change the world" with a new political path. what follows is a rather far-fetched and quite 'silly' storyline, which is obviously set out to target young children as the main target audience. unlike it's predecessor, evan almighty is a family orientated film with the ambiguous genre of 'comedy' tagged upon it's misleading position of 'sequel' to which some would regard a modern-day comedy classic that can be enjoyed by a slightly more mature, upscale audience.generally speaking, evan almighty comprises itself of terrible cinematic values. the acting; omit steve carell and morgan freeman, was rigid and many of the characters were seemingly thrown in to use up the unnecessarily large budget issued for the production. additionally, the cast includes acting legend john goodman who makes an appearance as a heel and is seen just a few times in the movie's entirety; i didn't quite buy the character though and thought the storyline from which he was involved in lacked depth even for a family comedy. every other character in the movie (especially the wife and kids!) deserve a mention for their acting so cheesy it could fill a king-size kiev. be warned though; it is the typical americanized cheddarfest associated with many mainstream family-orientated films, so i'd advise you defend yourself with the nearest grater in sight.it may seem the movie is worthless thus-far, however, it does have -some- promising aspects. the cgi was outstanding and it was clear that a lot of time went into modelling the ark and producing water effects and animation of the computer generated animals towards the end. the particles, renders and textures used were aesthetically stellar. although part of me couldn't help, but think these were undeserving to a movie with such poor ideals and were, in my opinion, 'too good' for this piece of cinema and carried the movie throughout.overall i view this film as a disaster in terms of continuing what was a franchise with huge potential, but unfortunately it fell short to a bad conclusion in the almighty series and approaching the end of the film i had set my expectations high for an epic and somehow meaningful finale to make up for the mediocre content i had so far witnessed. this wasn't the case and i was deeply disappointed and confused come the closing credits. as i sat discontent i couldn't help, but think the movie wasn't anywhere near as 'mighty' as i hoped for. in many ways the film reminded me of a watered down "night at the museum" as it showed similar styling and characteristics, but unfortunately was leagues below even that.i give this movie 3 out of 10, as it is watchable, but it's definitely one to be avoided! if you have to see this film, be prepared for disappointment as 'mildly entertained' is the best you could hope to obtain in watching the said production.

although i'm not too much of a religious person, i still had relatively high hopes for this movie, as it does have the amazing steve carrell, and its prequel, bruce almighty, was actually a creative and clever christian-themed comedy. however, evan almighty comes nowhere near this originality and freshness that the original has, and can't decide whether it's a comedy or a sentimental movie about faith and family values. if it had chosen one clear path of which of these themes to focus on, it could have lived up to its potential, but instead the result of mixing the two is a film that has a very flat and dry sense of humor, cheesy dialogue and motifs that attempt to give the movie profundity, but instead practically insults the intelligence of the audience, and also a very confused and clouded presentation of the movie's opaque message. it was very obvious that evan almighty was very poorly written, there are numerous plot holes and elements in the movie that make absolutely no sense. for example, although a large variety of exotic animals from all over the planet swarm to evan as he builds the ark for their salvation from the flood, is their inclusion really necessary when the only "flood" that happens in the movie is downtown washington d.c. and a suburban neighborhood, meaning they are at no risk of being wiped out? the filmmakers it seems lacked the originality to modernize the bible story whatsoever, and instead just had it take place in a present time without changing anything to the plot, leaving many elements that just don't add up such as this and make it obvious of the idiotic motifs and writing within the movie. overall, this work is tragic in that the acting talent of steve carrell and wanda sykes isn't exhibited because of the bland characters they portray, and that it was so poorly written that it skews and clouts many of the film's attempted themes, and makes a mockery of the first film. finally, evan almighty also is an insult to the brilliant actors in it and any halfway-intelligent moviegoer, in that it fails both of them miserably.

well, i watched this film expecting to be rolling in the aisles ... how wrong i was. the film was moderately amusing, at best, and irritating at worst (the slapstick comedy styling of building an ark with archaic tools, laugh ... no i didn't). i'm very disappointed given steve carrel was the lead. i've watch the office us religiously, cracks me up immensely, i thought 40 year old virgin was good ... but evan 'elp us- why on earth did he accept this script. and, as for morgan freeman- he's old enough to know better.so, the idea seemed reasonable, the actors i had every faith in- but the execution was nothing to write home about and the ending, well it seemed as if they had run out of money, or ideas. this for me was one of the most contrived endings i could have imagined. they took a biblical story and dumbed it down to a cautionary tale on localized environmental issues, not even global issues, but a local bill - yawn!in summary, reasonable start, got gradually worse and, for me, it was all washed out by the time the credit's rolled.

i had neither read any of the books nor seen the first movie so after receiving passes to a preview show, i had no expectations.'angels and demons' was a muddled, convoluted film lacking direction or any believability. there was very little character development and i never found myself caring about the plight of the protagonists; the reverse was true, i was more interested in seeing how the antagonists would succeed as the first half of the film was almost exclusively focused on why the illuminati are who they are.the film jumps from location to location with little explanation or reason and expects the viewer to believe that everybody in the movie is an ally when they first meet. any analytical mind will realize this is highly improbable.the climax is extremely cliché and leaves you asking what happened and wondering why nobody considered some of these points, it feels very tacked on and unnecessary.the actors are not particularly believable in their roles, mostly because i found it difficult to believe that scientists, professors, and men of the church would act in the manner that they do without regard to the consequences of their actions. events that happen are not plausible in the slightest and the pace of the movie is questionable with the characters jumping around while on a tight schedule and i had to question how the protagonists manage to get from location to location on time, every time.the most pleasing part of the film is the cinematography, i found it a beautiful film to watch but it was such a mess, that i found it would not be worth paying to view in theatres.

this movie was a failure as a comedy and a film in general. it was a very slow paced movie that seemed to be trying to convey a message, but the message was a cliché, hopeless mess to begin with. this movie falls on shameless environmental point, even making a self-righteous point of destroying an suv and promoting animal planet.in sitting through this, i couldn't help but notice that steve carell got no more than a single truly funny line. the only thing that could hypothetically mark this as a comedy is the pitiful attempt to give comic relief lines to wanda sykes. her character gets frequent, cringe-worthy lines where they absolutely do not fit.far from the brilliance of bruce almighty, evan almighty blows its whole record-breaking budget on special effect plot devices that turn out to barely advance the plot. the movie spends the first half building up to the construction of evan's ark, but by the end, we learn that the ark was completely meaningless, and the whole plot was a just a vessel for the stupid gags and even stupider messages. the movie concludes when we learn that the whole ark, flood, and animal gathering was just a weak political statement by none other than god. yes, god was trying to influence politics.

i very much enjoyed bruce almighty but the minute i found out that there was going to be a sequel without jim carey, i knew it was bad. although steve carell was hysterical in the first film ( the babbling scene is one of my favorites) , and, in my opinion , deserves an emmy for his role in the office , he is pretty weak in this dull comedy. i'm curious how much work the script writers put, because we could just as well do without the story . but even if we discard the huge plot holes (why did elephants and lions come to aid evan when the flood only concerned that particular area of washington) the film is simply ...not funny. i did not laugh once and as far as i remember, a comedy is supposed to make you laugh . or giggle at least. not this one.there is small hope however. evan almighty has "family" written all over it and maybe a family viewing might be enjoyable,(kids might be entertained by the variety of animals and the silly jokes) , but ,for me, evan almighty simply doesn't cut it.i give it a 4/10 and hope that carell will be more careful when choosing his roles in the feature.

the biggest problem with this film is that it's nothing like bruce allmighty. the first film played upon every daydreamer's fantasy of being able to control ones surroundings as one sees fit. evan's experience though is entirely different. he has none of the control that jim carrey fools around with and instead the story centers around the power of belief. now this would have been fine, since the first film was preaching the same message. the problem is that the sequel does it's preaching at the expense of the comic relief. and to add insult to injury it also throws in politics into the plot. you get the distinct feeling that there is a clear message with this film, and it's main objective is not to make you laugh. to sum things up this movie is failed mixture of eddie murhphy's "the distinguished gentleman" and charlton heston's "the ten commandments". i'm not sure if steve carrell is at fault here, you get a sense that it's his character that limits his abilities as a comedian, the former news anchor evan baxter is not supposed to be funny, he's basically an antagonist made into a protagonist which in this case only adds to the confusion of what this movies message is supposed to be about.

this was a flick doomed from its conception. the very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre pg-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a pg-rated family movie. i wasn't the least bit interested. then came the trailer. not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the entire movie; and i'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer. it's like a 3-minute cliff's notes version of the flick. so obviously i wasn't gonna pay to see it, but once it hit dvd, i thought sure, i'll watch it for free. maybe steve carell can save it.nope.i'm still baffled as to why he signed on for this. he must have owed someone a favor. the jokes were all so flat and obvious, and the director obviously asked him to go for very broad comedy style like the original bruce almighty's jim carrey. but it's just not funny. the studio obviously tried to cash in on the success of 40-year-old virgin, complete with several of carell's past co-stars, a reference to the flick on a theater marquee, and another musical closing credits sequence. but even the talented carrell can't save this. his co-stars don't fare much better, with people like morgan freeman, jonah hill, and ed helms just wasted. wanda sykes isn't wasted, she's just a waste in anything she does, and her horrible one-liners and reactions just make you wish people would stop giving her work.the story itself is just predictable and lazy. it pounds you over the head with obvious foreshadowing, like evan's disregard for the environment (drives a gas-guzzling humvee, opts to use wood from endangered trees for his house, hates animals,...), and by the end it's just over-the-top preachy on both faith and the environment.why the movie was made at all is puzzling enough, but i really don't understand how it reportedly became the most expensive comedy ever. the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work i've ever seen. maybe the rental of the live animals on set cost a fortune. who knows. but whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn't translate to quality, that's for sure. but hey, it wasn't the worst film of the year by far. there's still plenty of worse duds like norbit and death proof.

i hated this film. simply put, this film is so bad that i almost want to disregard ever watching it and never again mentioning it. but on the other hand, i can't resist a good bashing. and if there's one thing that evan almighty does for the audience it is that it brings out the best criticism.the film (a sequel to the much funnier bruce almighty) starts out by reintroducing the audience to evan baxter, a mere supporting at best character in the original film. that's right. this film shows no jim carrey or jennifer anisten. not even a small cameo appearance. you know your film is bad when the guy that agreed to do ace venture: when nature calls won't even have a short walk-on role. but somehow they manage to keep morgan freeman as god. while sitting in the near empty theater bored out of my mind at the lack of comedy i couldn't help but wonder how much money it took to secure freeman for this film. then it hit me an hour ago. it's just a throwaway role that takes up all of 20 minutes in the 100 minute film. god just pops up in between scenes to tell evan to build the ark. sure i know morgan freeman won't look at this film in a year and think it's as good as his roles in the shawshank redemption and million dollar baby but it's easy money.where was i? oh yes, the plot. sometimes it's so hard to keep focused on the plot when you realize that you gave more thought thinking about the plot than the writer of the screenplay did. anyway evan (steve carell) has apparently left his job as a news anchorman for a job as a congressman. yeah... with no transition in between. he never turns to his wife and says "i think i want to be a congressman." it just happens within the first five minutes and you are forced to deal with the big transition. well as a congressman he is to partner for a bill proposed by john goodman's character when suddenly god appears to tell evan to build an ark. no "hey, how you doing? how's the weather?" bit. just "i want you to build an ark." evidence of bad writing: evan determines that god is giving him clues to build an ark after noticing a fan hold up a sign saying genesis 6:14 when he's walking past his son whose watching a televised baseball game.that's basically the plot of evan almighty. there are some random supporting cast members that do their best at creating comedy but they don't do very well because they aren't given hardly any screen time. it's just your basic run of the mill family building an ark film. oh and also there's that obligatory scene where a father has to cancel his hiking plans with his kids and wife because he becomes busy with work. they walk off disappointed but they understand, as do all the other times in film this has happened. just once would i love to see the youngest kid turn to his father and kick him in the chins and tell him "you're a real bastard for canceling your plans with us. i'm going to turn emo now." there's also that drama that you'd expect from the father with his family when they realize (the wife, actually... the three kids have no problem helping dad build an ark) that he's gone crazy and he claims god wants him to build a big boat. but don't worry. his family decides to stick with him. oops, i just spoiled the drama.another problem with this film is that there is hardly any good comedy going on. i know the decision was made to rate have this be a pg film to get a bigger crowd reaction but i don't think i'm in the minority when i think that family humor is more than just guys getting kicked in the nuts and animals crapping. maybe i'm wrong and that's what quality family humor has been reduced to. and if it is, please bring me more adult comedies so i won't have to sit through anymore of this crap (pun not intended).the ending is extra cheesy. all of a sudden the film takes a dramatic cgi filled turn that makes me shudder to think how it is a terrible waste of cgi. i bet it was expensive too. finally after all that waiting we are told why god wanted evan to build an ark. and boy oh boy i hated the reason why. i'll spare the details but it was like watching or reading a murder mystery and having the killer turn out to be the person who walked behind the main character for one second and had no lines.oh and then there's a nice touch at the very end. the song "gonna make you sweat (everybody dance now)" plays over the credits and we are then subjected to the "dancing" of the cast. i don't get it. they spend 100 minutes unsuccessfully making a comedy and then they wrap it up with a thriller. i swear i haven't been that scared watching steve carell dance since ... well never. there you have it folks. evan almighty is the scariest film of all time.all in all i thought it was a wasted experience. i'm baffled at all the talented actors (carell, freeman and goodman) appearing in this bore-fest alongside lauren graham, the woman from gilmore girls that has yet to prove to me that she can act her way out of a paper bag. but most of all i'm surprised at my will power to actually sit through the whole film without walking out.rating: * out of ****

'a comedy of biblical proportions!' those masters of hyperbole, the movie-tag-line-writers, at it again; the sequel to 2003's bruce almighty, raises barely a chuckle. the only thing which raises my interest in this movie above total indifference is its dogmatic christian undertones. sorry, make that overtones.steve carrel, ignoring jim carrey's good sense to decline a role reprisal, plays evan baxter, the smug news anchor from bruce almighty, who has just been elected to congress. with a new life in virginia and the stress of moving into a house the size of the acropolis, the pressure of all the change takes its toll on his family. his wife (lauren graham), evidently airlifted in from stepford, and three sons (jimmy bennett, graham phillips and johnny simmons), who do a stilted job of looking sad to a piano accompaniment, pray for the family to become closer, and almost out of guilt, so does evan.in what must be the greatest shock of all time, god (morgan freeman) actually shows up, but does the whole pesky 'working in mysterious ways' thing all over the place by telling evan to build a noah-esquire ark in preparation for a great flood instead of just giving him a pool table or and x-box or something. and in true mischievous deity style, he also forces evan to grow a beard, long hair and wear worn and tatty robes. now, back in the day i'm sure razors were hard to come by so the beard was somewhat of an inevitability for noah, but i'm almost certain it had nothing to do with spirituality. same with the robes; a massive construction job is surely made all the more difficult by such impractical clothing. couldn't god have conjured up a pair of steel toed boots and a hard hat for the poor guy? apparently not.to paraphrase bill hicks, i find the idea that god is messing with us somewhat unsettling, and so does evan who fights him every step of the way. and who wouldn't? god essentially gets him fired, drives away his loved ones, makes him a laughing stock and at one point actually threatens him. of course god turns out to be right, and the rational, hard working family man who was getting on fine by himself is forced to eat a large slice of bittersweet humble pie. it's almost as if to be left alone by god, evan had to tolerate and humour him. what kind of message is that? evan almighty does have a highly commendable environmental slant, with the underlying theme being that the federal government is blind to the damage being done to the world around us. it is also the first film ever to offset its carbon emissions and this should surely be considered a landmark achievement by a hollywood studio. were it not for the trite, condescending banner of american christianity flying high above it, evan almighty could have been an inoffensive family movie, with a praiseworthy environmental record. but with its confused religious dogma and relentless 'blind faith' message, it ranks as one of the most repugnant movies of all time.

well, for this abomination of a film, i wasn't expecting anything good. i find steve carell annoying, and bruce almighty was pretty good but there is absolutely no reason for it to have a sequel. somehow, this film was even lower than my expectations, even when i didn't have any. does anyone remember the disney movie noah with tony danza? well, let's just say that evan almighty completely ripped it off in way too many ways for the movie to remain justifiable. actually evan almighty was had the exact same plot outline as noah, with the exception of a few technicalities, it was nothing but a carbon copy of a far-superior movie that was actually funny. another thing, did anyone get sick of wanda sykes' stupid, unfunny, redundant, one-liners that were literally in every single scene? it was completely ridiculous and just dragged the movie down more and more. despite the fact that i basically had already seen the film ten years earlier(noah), evan almighty has to be the most predictable movie i've ever seen. i figured out the entire movie from beginning to end within the first five minutes and eventually realized that it was ripping off noah left and right. in conclusion, if you're a little bit unsure of whether or not you want to see evan almighty, and are already sick of jonah hill playing the same role in every single movie he's in, liked bruce almighty, and don't want to see a predictable, dry, unfunny movie with steve carell trying to act like jim carrey, then please, don't see this piece of garbage.

one hundred and seventy five million dollars is a hell of a lot of money to spend on even the biggest summer blockbuster. not even michael bay had a budget that big for transformers, so exactly how universal pictures spent that much cash making evan almighty is a mystery. they certainly didn't spend it on the script for one thing as the film is not so much a classic comedy as it is christian flag waving and bar one or two quiet chuckles, you're most likely to spend the duration wondering where the budget went or why steve carrell felt the need to slum it in a decidedly average movie at the exact moment when his star profile has begun to rise.a sequel to the jim carrey comedy bruce almighty, this film sees former supporting character evan baxter (carrell) moving up the ladder into the main player slot. the story opens with him leaving the news desk to become a public official and moving to washington with his wife and three generic sons (slightly weird primary school moppet, spirited middle schooler and sulky teenager). evan's bid to change the world through politics however gets a spanner in the works when god (morgan freeman) appears and asks him to build an ark.in other words, it's an updating of the old genesis story, with evan fighting off cynicism and naysayers to build the immense boat. unfortunately, while the premise is reasonably promising, it sadly does not provide many laughs. there's a bit of fun to be had in the early going where evan's straight-laced mp tries to juggle the demands of public service with the unwelcome packs of animals that follow him around and a beard that resists all attempts to shave it, but as soon as he accepts his divine mission, the film takes a nosedive.from this point on, it turns into a message movie. evan begins preaching with alarming regularity and morgan freeman keeps turning up to offer kind wisdom, while gently prodding his chosen in the right direction. without evan's resistance though, the only trace of comedy left comes in the form of a few rubbish animal-feces jokes and john michael higgin's role as evan's exasperated right-hand man. higgins may show the same rich comic potential that he did previously in arrested development, but his enthusiasm cannot save the sinking vessel, especially seeing as carrell has all but placed his formidable improv skills on the back-burner.in some respects, it's slightly similar to the passion of the christ, but unlike mel gibson's movie which encouraged everyone to believe in god through blood letting and guilt tripping, evan almighty tries a more gentle approach. the movie simply tells us that we should have faith in god, because he has faith in us. unfortunately, this movie is just as likely to make you laugh as the passion is. carrell is on autopilot, the jokes don't exist and wanda sykes makes a bid to become the most annoying person on the planet. it might be sweet, but somebody just tossed $175 000 000 overboard.

although i enjoy steve carrell's work, evan the almighty, like so many other overdone films turned out to be a lot worse than i hoped it would be.this turned out to be a cheesy family movie, the kind that employ famous comedian to improve their image, but ultimately fail to deliver.the usual carell's dorky humour is almost absent from the movie and though he did make me chuckle a few times, there was nothing hilarious about him in evan the almighty.his 3 kids, although were probably somehow important for a biblical character, were really quite useless in the movie and terrible actors. even his wife, was somewhat of a third leg for such a simple storyline.spending so much money on making a comedy was a huge mistake. although, carell's career might profit from this movie, there's no real reason to go see it.if only there was a little less of his family, a little more of carell, molly shannon and maybe some other snl cast, it could have actually been a lot more entertaining.4/10 for a few chuckles here and there.

this picture is a bad and blown up rip off of the michael pohl short film extinct from 1995. while michael pohl's idea was original and perfect for a short film setting, a sound of thunder's plot was poorly adapted from pohl's story and not fit for a full length feature film one would expect from a major hollywod studio. the tragic flooding situation that ruined the sets in prague was just one bad link in a long rusty film production chain in this case. for a studio to release such a product... it is a shame. especially for warner brothers, a studio which broke new effects grounds with shows like babylon 5 in 1993. on television. visual effects for television shows pioneering cgi in episodic television in the mid nineties were way more sophisticated than what is brought to the screen in this picture. in cases like this, sad as it may be: can the film.

this critique tells the story of 4 little friends who went to watch angels and demons the movie on the first night it came out, even though it was a school night, because "angels and demons is worth it." two of the four had read the book. of those that didn't, a guy, was wearing pink skinny jeans. this was the least eventful part of the evening after watching the abhorrent angels and demons.the movie starts out in a lab where the antimatter is being created while another process is going on. and apparently someone knows about it or something. notice how very confused i am.. i don't get what happened: they were just making the antimatter. vittoria finds her own father dead... what? the illuminati symbol sent to langdon is a printout, not a burn on someone's chest. they take out the x-33 scene. they take out maxmillian kohler. they, pretty much, take out cern and the symbology connected to it. they take out the hassasin and replace him with some religious, british dude. they take out the illuminati diamond. they take out vittoria's near-rape scene. they take out langond's fight with the hassasin (now british dude on crack). they take out the press dude following them around. they take out the death of the fourth cardinal. they take out the fact that the camerlengo becomes pope. they take out the camerlengo's grand scheme. they take out langdon's being in the helicopter and landing on that island toward the end. they take out the fact that vittoria's father was a scientific priest. they take out langdon's fun and most unfortunately, they take out vittoria's sexual appeal.other than the movie completely losing focus of the details, the movie is acted horribly. one must admit, though, there were some good things. for example, the sistine chapel recreation must have been extremely difficult and it was extremely well done. the explosion scene was mind-blowing. other than that, screw this movie for ruining the book for the people who didn't read it.

this is a pitiful movie. what makes it even more pitiful is the time, effort and money put into a super predictable script and action.it's about some kind of monsters, by the way, and some kind of insects. don't expect an explanation of the plot. there is none. that might work, if there was something of interest, or characters we could care about. there isn't. everything that happens to any person is as predictable as the other movies sci fi channel does.don't try to understand what some of the characters are saying. they speak gibberish, especially the annoying lead woman, whose accent is a sort of thick british that is harder to understand than any old british movie you may have seen. she's unintelligible.a lot of money is spent on some great sets and scenery, and that is the major crime of this movie, because it just isn't worth it.

what could have been a good story was destroyed by the ludicrous time travel scenario. if something was altered in the past that changed evolution and humans never developed, the time machine would never have been built. if something from the past was brought into the present, it would have no effect on the past.i really wish film producers would run their ideas past an actual scientist before finishing the script. even if you suspend reality and assume time travel is possible, you have to stick to logic.otoh, ben kingsley seemed to be having a great time with his over the top performance. all of the other actors seemed to be doing the best they could as well. it was the writing that left them twisting in the wind."back to the future" handled it better.

an extremely fast paced,exhilarating, interesting, detail rich book. its a huge shame that the film had none of these qualities. not only was tom hanks' mild mannered portrayal or robert langdon laughable, but the name changes to key characters, huge deviances from the original story line, and poor irish/italian accent from carmalengo played by ewan mcgregor, made for the worst book to film ever.as a huge fan of a&d the book, i had high hopes for a more lavish, true to book detailed movie, where it would start and finish just as the book did - leaving me wanting more.all the film really did was depress me within the 1st 10 minutes.what was impressive was how the... sorry! i couldn't even finish that sentence without laughing.in short - vittoria was the token hottie, a very second to audrey tatou and there were some very nice alfa romeos.i would recommend reading the book to understand that, if ron howard must insist on making another book to film, i would be happy saving my £6.40 for a kfc zinger meal and some chicken wings - far more entertaining and deeply more satisfying!

post 1988 after the disaster gjs amitabh's films lost the quality they had earlier barring main azaad hoon released in 1989 which was a great film rest all films were craps mostly except hum(1991) later in 1991this is another of the crap amitabh films people rejected in early 90'sthe film he did like a friendship token to shashi kapoor who directed the film and he didn't take a penny the film also had rishi and dimple(again not paired opp each other after ranbhoomi) the film came in 1991 when bachchan had 4 releases and 3 flops amongst them indrajeet, akayla, ajooba ajooba came 2 years after toofan and jaadugar both supernatural films which were rejected this is another type of crap bachchan wears a mask and a krissh type outfit and performs magic changing 1 person to a donkey.etc of course being 1991 you can excuse the special effects but the film is too bad to be watcheddirection by shashi kapoor is not good music is badamongst actors amitabh had become too old by 1991 and looked tired, his acting is okay but not on par with his best rishi is okay dimple is alright, rest are forgettable

this movie was a thorough diappointment. there was no development of the story. viewers were thrown into the story without explanation and left to fend for themselves in trying to work out what was going on. the action sequences were okay but confusing. they weren't the matrix and they weren't crouching tiger. this movie is best left to cable tv where you don't have to pay to see it or convincing a friend that they should hire it and then go over and watch it. as a huge jet li fan, i expected more. how can someone involved with once upon a time in china put his name to this one???

i wanted to dog this movie, but somehow i can't find it in myself to do that.exhibiting a duality of fighting styles, it's li vs. li in a somewhat decent battle for supremacy.this is one of those movies where the story carries the performances. li's acting is extremely amateurish, hesitant, and stiff for most of this movie...right up to the very end. at first i tricked myself into believing he was just doing that for one of his two characters. you know, to show a difference in personalities. but it appeared to be inexperience or a lack of talent. it did get a bit better, more relaxed, toward the end. but that wasn't enough to save his performance. jet li's acting does improve as his career moves forward. i don't hate his acting. i just hated him in this.i also have to say that the effects were very "b" class effects. what effects there are.the story itself had great potential. it was uniquely creative, daring, and fresh. unfortunately, either the budget was not ample enough to accommodate better lighting, effects, film quality, and some acting lessons, or the director just did not care enough to bother with these little details. he also did not bother with the science in the science-fiction. a fact which was a great detractor to this film.the fight sequences were a bit one sided, as he seemed to give more to one character and little to the other. but all in all the story line made for a very enjoyable attempt.as enjoyable as this was, i couldn't help but think, all the way through, that this was just one of those movies that you can't help but watch it for what it should've been, rather than what it is.it rates a 6.0/10 on the "b" scale.that's a 4.2/10 (on the "a" scale) for having a good plot, from...the fiend :.

i didn't want to write this movie off on the reviews and critics in the western world, i mean how wrong have they been about asian cinema that has now become a staple diet of the hollywood remake monster? plus jet l is pretty damn cool, and he's made some interesting movies in asia. so with an open mind i was surprisingly averaged out by this movie.there are good points. the story is very clever, using m-theory as a base to bring forward the plot that there are multiple universes each with their own versions of worlds, and most likely you. each time one of you is destroyed the rest share the energy and power amongst them. the idea that someone might try and purposely become the only version of themselves in all the universes to find out if they become a god.there's also jet li, and he's not a bad actor and pretty nimble as a martial artist, plus jason statham who is an all round good actor. as for the special effects, some of them are really cool, a mixing of bullet time, and slow motion with normal speed, very cool to watch in places.the bad points? well statham's accent is appalling, and some of the effects aren't as comparable as others, so it's quite apparent that money was spent on some of the main shots and not on others that were probably deemed as too short on screen or they just plain ran out of budget.a big sore point for me is the close cropped camera action that hollywood has long favoured, something that jackie chan has often talked about. filming fight scenes close up serves two purpose. it gives greater emphasis on a single punch or movement, making it look harder and more real than it really is, and it also hides what is going on around the camera lens. for example people holding a fake arm or the face of a stunt double, etc.what chan always said was that he tried to open out the camera and show the audience what was going on, let them see the people fighting properly rather than a close up of a face and a fist, cutting to someone falling into frame. showing the whole picture is more effective, and it's more impressive.so the close cropped shots were just more annoying than anything, you failed to see the impressiveness of li's fighting skills, and you found it hard to see some of the action. slow the cuts down and pan out the camera hollywood directors! the biggest problem was the story though, despite having such a strong base on which to build, they seemed to loose the sense of the plot and concentrate on the action scenes. there are some serious plot building and explanatory moments that are just totally overlooked and covered in the space of a few sentences, yet these could have formed some excellent and complex character development.it just all held together too weakly, and not enough was made of the story. all in all, not a great movie and it's potential was badly spoiled.

it's a shame that such a lame plot should be hung on such picturesque locations, with some documentary style reportage shoved in for extra length. a shorter film may have held the tension a little more, and a more charismatic lead may not have mangled his lines so much. the female lead also, was not allowed to do enough resulting in a pretty but boring affair. it builds towards the end but the lead actor's own redemption is too little too late and should have been revealed earlier in the film. not awful, just a pity. unexciting but nice enough to grace tv schedules of the early hours.

of all the adaptations of books by alistair maclean, i feel that this qualifies as the worst, but don´t blame maclean!. it would appear that all that this film shares with the novel is the same title. we have no suspense, no sense of foreboding of mystery, no chance to really empathize with the main characters. we spend the entire duration (or at least i did) waiting for charlotte rampling to shed her clothing (for charlotte, this appears to take a remarkably long time!). still, a glimpse of charlotte rampling´s tits really can´t save this disastrous film. maclean has once again been kicked into the gutter to endure the sniping of those bitter hacks and nit-pickers who would appear to blame him for all the ills that befall attempted filming of his books. poor old alistair must have crawled into a corner and whimpered when this one came out. at least "bear island" - which also uses the maclean name but apparently none of his novel - was a little exciting. the excitement here is in waiting for the final credits.

proof, if ever proof were needed, that hammer should have left their vampires firmly in the victorian age. after all, vampirism is all about repressed sexuality, so the concept is irrelevant in 1972's london, with its thirty-something thesps pretending to be randy teenagers.remember, by this time, hammer was floundering badly. the public had tired of the drawing room horror of the 1950s and 60s, so the studio was trying everything to bring them back, including ample nudity (lust for a vampire, et al) and updating their characters - neither of which apparently worked as hammer was pretty much resting in it grave just two years later. shame ...but i still have a great fondness for the classic hammer period from 1957-1965.

being too young to have experienced the hammer films when they were fresh and new, i am discovering their hallowed horror films as i find them on dvd. i know it was almost a decade and half between them but it's hard to see much of the magic in the original hammer dracula in this late entry to the christopher lee series. the original hammer vampire story had lots of atmosphere and a terrific story to get involved in. lee was a great dracula, a vibrant vampire if that possible, in the early outing but here he is nothing more than a cardboard character that mostly stands around and looks threatening. the modish young people talk like cartoon characters (even though my aunt lived in england during the 1970s and she says people actually talked with those awful clichés). i had no interest whatsoever in who lived or died amongst the younger crowd. they were all pretty terrible characters anyway. i did enjoy seeing a young and charismatic caroline munro; but she leaves the story too early. lee and his historic nemesis peter cushing add an air of authenticity to the film but they can't draw blood from this empty film. it's d.o.a.

though i had sort of enjoyed the satanic rites of dracula (1974), i knew i shouldn't expect too much from its even more maligned predecessor! surely the least of the hammer draculas (marcus hearn on the audio commentary for the creeping flesh [1973] even goes so far as to call it the studio's nadir!), the film really flounders due to its totally unhip - and now embarrassingly dated - updating of the myth (the modern-day setting actually suited satanic rites rather better)...even if, truth be told, it's still vastly preferable to dreck like dracula 2000 (2000) or van helsing (2004)!despite christopher lee's vociferous bashing of the film, he still cuts an undeniably striking figure as the undead vampire (even if he appears very little and is inexplicably confined to one setting); likewise, peter cushing delivers his usual committed performance. the only other noteworthy acting job in the film is that given by christopher neame (son of director ronald) as johnny alucard(!) - even if that's only because of how unbelievably hammy it is! unfortunately, the two best-known female members of the cast (both of them horror regulars) - stephanie beacham and caroline munro - can't rise above their physical attributes.the camera-work is by dick bush (who had shot the blood on satan's claw [1971] and, for hammer, when dinosaurs ruled the earth [1970] and twins of evil [1971] - but is perhaps best known for his longtime association with ken russell) which manages some nice atmosphere throughout, especially during three crucial sequences: the carriage-ride scuffle at the (properly gothic) beginning; the hysterical black mass sequence, followed by the resuscitation of dracula; and the final confrontation between lee and cushing's van helsing.

veteran british television director alan gibson's "dracula a.d. 1972" qualifies as one of the least appetizing entries in the hammer studios series about bram stoker's immortal bloodsucker. actually, this represented the first time since terence fisher's memorable "horror of dracula" (1958) that christopher lee and peter cushing fought each other as mortal enemies. they would reprise the same roles a few years later in the final hammer dracula: "the satanic rites of dracula." further, it was the second-to-last dracula for hammer in which lee performed as the infamous fangster. for the record, "dracula a.d. 1972" was the seventh hammer dracula.the exciting prologue from 1872 prepares you for something vastly different than what the rest of this disappointing horror flick yields. eternal rivals count dracula and his nemesis professor lawrence van helsing are literally at each other's throats atop a runaway carriage in london's hyde park for a vigorous opening scene that makes everything else look comparatively anticlimactic. the carriage crashes, and dracula emerges hugging half of a wooden wheel with its shattered spokes embedded in his chest. of course, christopher lee has to grip this broken wheel against his body, but the imagery is striking enough in its own way to pass muster. the count expires and so does his opponent van helsing. however, one of dracula's disciples snatches the count's ring and scoops some of the vampire's ashes into a vial for safe-keeping.don houghton's screenplay hurtles the action ahead a hundred years to swinging london in 1972. we meet a smarmy young man, johnny alucard (christopher neame of "no blade of grass"), who loves to raise hell with a group of hippies that crash parties and drive the british police with their antics. alucard happens to be the descendant of one of dracula's servants. now, alucard has the count's ring and a vial of his dehydrated blood. alucard chooses the sight of a desecrated church to arrange a black mass. he invites his trendy friends, among them laura (super sexy carolina munro of "the spy who loved me"), gayner (marsha hunt), and jessica van helsing (stephanie beacham) to attend this black mass because it offers them something different. not surprisingly, they resurrect the count, and the evil bloodsucker sets his eyes on jessica. meanwhile, after laura's body is discovered drained of blood, scotland yard inspector murray (michael coles of "doctor who and the dalkes") solicits help from van helsing's modern day offspring lorrimar (peter cushing). dracula wants to exact revenge on van helsing by taking the latter's granddaughter as his bride. lorrimar tracks down alucard; they fight in his chelsea apartment, and the young vampire drowns in a tub of water. remember, running water is just as lethal to vampires as sunlight and crucifix. van helsing finds dracula in the deserted church with his daughter awaiting the count. van helsing and dracula tangle. van helsing flings holy water into dracula's face. the vampire falls into an open gravesite with a stake awaiting him and he decomposes again.the chief problem with "dracula a.d. 1972" is that we don't get enough of lee as the count, though we do get considerably more of cushing as van helsing. furthermore, scenarist don houghton keeps dracula confined to the ramshackle church and never allows the vampire to venture out into the city. despite its low budget, "dracula a.d. 1972" could have been a lot better. the scene where the contemporary van helsing has to jot down alucard and spell it backwards to get dracula seems almost laughable. you'd think that he'd know about this backwards spelling trick. unless you are afraid of horror movies, this one will make you yawn. occasionally, gibson presents us with a superb close-up of dracula with his bared fangs and blood-shot eyes, but this is about as scary as this chiller gets, and that isn't saying much.

the idea of bringing dracula to contemporary times isn't bad--after all, it might revive the series a bit by injecting a new story element into a series that hammer has all but exhausted in a long series of generally excellent movies. however, because the present day turned out to be the crappy early 1970s, the results were pretty silly and looked more like love at first bite (a deliberate comedy). seeing christopher lee in a film filled with 70s hip lingo and electric guitar chords and laughable rock music just seemed beyond stupid. to make matters worse, the acting is much more over-the-top here--with an intense and silly performance by "johnny alucard". i also thought it was really funny that it took van helsing's grandson to notice that "alucard" is "dracula" spelled backwards--no one else figured this out for themselves! wow, what cunning!! so because so much of the movie was bad, why did it still earn an almost respectable score of 4? well, when the story came to the expected showdown between van helsing (peter cushing) and drac (christopher lee), it was exciting and ended very well. additionally, and i know this will sound very sexist, but if i had to watch a bad film, at least stephanie beacham's character wore some really nice outfits that revealed her ample...."talents", so to speak. so at least it was a pretty film to watch.by the way, the film ends with the phrase "may he rest in final peace" at the end, though this was not the final hammer dracula film with lee. he returned for "the satanic rites of dracula" just a short time later and it was in many ways even worse than this dud of a monster film.

if you first saw this movie with mary of the fourth form, then it's perhaps possible for the haze of nostalgia to encourage your charitable side. if not, it doesn't stand a chance. the young things' hipspeak is complete nonsense, people may have used the occasional word you'll hear here, but not huge batches of them in sentence after sentence. it doesn't so much date dracula ad 1972 as blow it to pieces, from the moment anyone under thirty opens their mouth it's impossible to take the film seriously and as for it being a laugh, it's not even a smile. the idea of throwing dracula into modern times is a good one and worthy of a far stronger script than don houghton can provide. the river thames and chelsea male are no match for puppet bats, model castles and terrified extras, but you can't help but feel that with better writing it would have been so different.

film starts off great in 1872 with a violent, bloody fight between dracula (christopher lee) and van helsing (peter cushing). dracula is impaled and dissolves to dust--van helsing also dies. somebody gathers dracula's ashes and buries them in the grounds of a church. cut to 1972--here's where the film falls apart.we are instantly hit over the head with loud, bad 70s music, horrible fashions and silly dialogue. when this was made hammer was losing money and decided to try anything to get a hit. putting dracula in the 1970s was not a good idea. the fashions, music and dialogue date the movie horribly. we're introduced to a bunch of annoying kids in their 20s who decide to have a black mass--"for a giggle". naturally they have it at the church (now abandoned) and naturally revive dracula. it's a good thing a descendant of van helsing is around...but dracula goes after his niece (stephanie beacham) in revenge.lee and cushing are great as always in their roles and whenever they're on screen the movie gets a much-needed shot of energy. the opening and ending battles are the highlights of the film (although the ending is spoiled a lot by playing lousy 70s music). also the main ringleader of the kids is named johnny alucard (christopher neame)--a truly stupid name that dates back to the 1940s. the film also has scream queen caroline munro looking absolutely great. the film is well-directed and pretty well-acted but the plot is stupid, the constant barrage of 70s fashion, dialogue and music gets annoying real quick and i was basically bored silly.most hammer fans agree--this was one of the worst dracula movies--it's followup (satantic rites of dracula) was the worst--and the last hammer dracula film. this gets a 2--just for cushing and lee.

in this desperate and thoroughly silly attempt to keep hammer's dracula franchise alive despite having lost most of its power long time already, our legendary vampire is brought back to life in the swinging london of 1972. exactly hundred years after he was destroyed by his archenemy van helsing, an occult disciple named johnny alucard (get it? get it?) gathers his flamboyant friends in an abandoned church, among them van helsing's great granddaughter jessica, and performs a satanic ritual that resurrects dracula in a haze of smoke. dracula's only mission is to wreak havoc upon the entire van helsing lineage and fragile jessica is the ideal victim to achieve this. this is probably the only 70's film that goes immensely over the top in trying to look likea 70's film! considering the previous six dracula films were all set in the victorian era, director alan gibson really wants to stress the fact we're in the 20th century now and thus he stuffs his film with insufferable hippie-characters, hideous 70's fashion trends and awful 70's music. christopher lee and peter cushing seem hopelessly lost in this setting and their performances regretfully show it. the opening sequence (a flashback) and the showdown climax are fairly enjoyable, but everything in between is painfully boring and the complete opposite of scary. the greatest elements in this series of films have always been dracula's dark castles and the exhilarating coach races and, obviously, this installment lacks all of that. luckily for the fans, hammer studios contemporary released other films revolving on vampires that are much better ("the vampire lovers", "twins of evil", "the legend of the seven golden vampires"). not recommended.

title: dracula a.d. 1972 director: alan gibson cast: peter cushing, christopher lee, stephanie beacham review: sometimes movies can be time capsules that transport you back to any given time. in this case...our time capsule is hammers dracula a.d. 1972 which transports us back to a time in which austin powers would have felt right at home.the story is about these group of kids (were not a gang! were a group!) that love to hang out at a café shop called "the cavern". one day, johnny alucard (hmm strange last name...wait...it spells dracula backwards!) a new member of the group offers the group a new way to get their kicks. he offers them a night of black mass and black magic. to which they also say "sure why the hell not, it could be fun!". so in no time flat, the find themselves resurrecting count dracula from the ashes.this movie opens up with a swinging party at some rich doofuses home. he knows non of the people at his party, yet there they all are partying the night away in his house. doing drugs, making out and dancing on top of tables. the filmmakers made sure that this sequence was completely engulfed in whatever young people considered cool at that time. everyone says words like "way out" and "groovy" and they finish many of their sentences saying "all that jazz". so yeah, its pretty evident that this is the 70s. to top it all off, there's a band that sounds something like "jefferson airplane"...i mean you'll be drowned in all things 70s. and as i watched this i kept asking myself "how the heck is dracula with his black cape and get up going to fit into all this?" and thats exactly what happens. old dracula feels out of place amidst all the partying and the rock and roll and drugs. many of the scenes in the film are great....but sadly the music they decided to add to the proceedings doesn't fit at all and completely takes you out of the mood of things. something horrifying or scary will be happening on screen and suddenly a bunch of loud trumpets and congos start to beat and your just completely taken out of the horror element. that sucked out the atmosphere right out of this movie for me.but all in all, putting all the distracting 70s music aside (an illness that satanic rites of dracula also suffered) the movie was pretty good. but i will mention this. the story was just a re-hash of what we had seen before in taste the blood of dracula. in fact the story is damn near identical. lets see...a young lad inherits draculas ring and ashes...check. he then decides to bring dracula back to life with the help of some people who know nothing about what they are getting into...check. black mass to bring dracula back in a desecrated church...check. the list of similarities goes on and on. so this movie ain't very original if you ask me.there are a few things that make this movie worth while though. for example the fact that the movie is a time capsule to london in the early seventies makes the film entertaining. i kept giggling and laughing every time someone spoke in 70 jargon. i couldn't believe some of the clothes these people wore and the cars they drove! it made the movie fun for me, but we are here to get spooked, were here to see drac kill a few virgins and take his revenge on the house of van helsing. did we get any of that? well yeah. there's a few good sequences squeezed in there to satisfy old school hammer fans. first off, there's the black mass sequence which was above all things satanic! they mention the name of many a demon and lots blood is spilled. that sequence was awesome but it was messed up by the music in its most crucial moment. then there's draculas actual resurrection which ill admit was great from a visual standpoint. some mist comes out of draculas grave and slowly but surely christopher lees silhouette and face emerge from the fog. cool shot! i loved it! we have a cushing and lee face off at the end. and i couldn't help to laugh at one point when dracula hurls a piece of furniture through the air. i laugh because he has done this in every single film since horror of dracula. its this hammer tradition where the characters start throwing candle sticks and chairs at each other. and i think to myself, aren't their more exciting things to show then a bad guy throwing a candle stick at our hero. oh well, anyhows, draculas demise in this one is very similar to all the other hammer draculas before it, vampire gets slaked and then we cut to a series of frames until there's only ashes left.all in all, an unintentionally funny hammer dracula film. its trapped in the 70s and though that makes it a fun watch (and its not as horrible as satanic rites of dracula) it still doesn't gel well with the dracula universe we had come to expect from hammer.rating 3 1/2 out of 5

after seeing the previews awhile back, i looked forward to seeing steve martin in a comedy that i thought might be a keeper. unfortunately, i was wrong. problem was, the previews were the only funny parts to the movie. the rest of the movie was pretty much a bunch of junk, scenes that have been done to death and characters we've all seen a thousand times.this movie was proof positive that if you put enough cash on the table, you can talk anybody into anything. steve martin is a favorite of mine but this one was a big clunker. the only actor in the movie who was worth watching was eugene levy; he was the best of a mighty lame group.

being a long-time steve martin fan, it hurt to see him in a movie with such a cliched script. the screenwriter must have just rented some videos and taken a piece here and a piece there - it certainly is about the least imaginative movie i've seen in a long time - i knew exactly what was going to happen in each scene as soon as it began. the african-american stereotypes and slave references are pretty offensive as well. but the thing that was the worst for me was to see martin in a movie without a trace of wit. he probably is one of the most intelligent actors and here he totally sold out to a totally dumbed down script. he must be behind in his alimony to be in such a lame effort.

the previews were so funny that i couldn't wait to see this movie. i just got home and i have to say i couldn't have been more embarrassed at this movie. yes there were times where the jokes were funny, but the stereotypical roles were painful. joan plowright is a fine actress but the scene with the "negro spiritual" was just in poor taste. needless to say the laughs were few and far between in the movie house for a largely white crowd (i was one of a very small handful of blacks).

(very serious spoilers)this movie was a huge disappointment. there are so many problems i dont know where to start. so, i'll talk about what is good about the film.the cast was great. steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middle-aged, upper class, uptight white guy. queen latifah plays a big, beautiful, urban, black gal. and eugene levy, well he pretty much plays himself. add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast - everyone played their parts really well. and if watching these guys for 1.75 hours is worth $8 to you, then you wont be disappointed.but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes. first of all, there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone. all the white people are uptight bigots. all the black people are ghetto ebonics-speakers. the blacks are hip, cool, with-it and poor. the whites are nerds, stiff, and rich. (except eugene levy, he is clearly taken with queen latifa and "speaks the lingo" - so latifa nicknames him a "freak". so - if you're a white man and you like black women and you know street slang you must be a freak). the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs.putting the race card aside, lets look at the major flaw in the film: they destroy latifa's character. she comes to martin's home under false pretense, but martin takes a liking to her anyway. she's supposed to be wrongly accused of robbery, martin takes up her cause. 3/4 of the way through the film we find out latifa's character escaped from jail. so, our sympathy for her goes out the window.there is no real plot. the movie plods along from scene to scene with latifa showing up in some place where she's "not" supposed to be (like a country club or martin's house) and martin trying to hide her. thats the running gag. then in the last minutes of the film they decide that they're going to finally deal with latifa's assertion that she was wrongly accused of bank robbery. martin goes under cover as a homeboy to extract a (let's face it, unusable) confession from latifa's ex boyfriend, and everyone lives happily ever after.finally (but there is a lot more wrong with this flick) this movie appears to be a hodge-podge of clips from other movies. the premise is clearly borrowed from another martin movie "the house-sitter". where goldie hawn comes to live with martin and shakes up his stodgy middle-class life. martin and latifa meet online - ala "youve got mail". the whole "quirky nanny fixes rich man's life" goes as far back as "the sound of music" and "mary poppins".i wouldnt see this movie again for free.

c'mon, let's put aside the sophomoric humor that we can find in racism and be honest...it isn't funny. i was appalled at the fact that the two main stars would agree to do a film that was so offensive and so detrimental to race relations, and i'm not referring to the obvious black/white commentary in the movie, but to the slams towards other ethnicities, such as betty white's characterizations of the hispanics. should we just chalk up her agreeing to do this movie as a sign of senility...is she too old to distinguish comedy from stereotypical trash? or is it the fault of the writers? how about the third assistant makeup person??? nope, the fault is with us for perpetuating this kind of crap (in the guise of comedy), that hollywood will continue to feed us until we have the decency to say enough is enough...racism is for real and it isn't a laughing matter. we're all different, let's celebrate that diversity, not poke fun at it and promote divisiveness.

steve martin has always had my respect for being a very funny comedian and a pretty good actor, and i loved "planes, trains and automobiles" and "bowfinger" --- but "bringing down the house" definately isn't one of martin's funniest works, and it doesn't even seem as if it's trying to be, which is just plain sad...i don't know; maybe i didn't like this movie because of the fact that i rented it along with "harry potter and the chamber of secrets" and "phone booth", both of which are excellent films, or maybe it's because i'm used to so much better from martin, or maybe it's just because i'm in a frickin' bad mood today...regardless, this film just wasn't very funny or entertaining, and i never managed more than a smile or a weak chuckle at the film's gags, which is really a shame, since the previews of this comedy were so promising! i was expecting "bringing down the house" to be an all-out comedy bash, and i certainly expected more slapstick comedy and inter-racial laughs from martin. instead, we're 'treated' to seeing queen latifah jiggle all over the screen, trying to do her best with her totally uninspired character. the funniest thing in this clunker is eugene levy, but even he doesn't get the screen-time he deserves.i would've really liked to enjoy "bringing down the house", but i didn't and i'd find it very difficult to recommend it to anyone but the most die-hard steve martin fans. skip this one and rent "planes, trains and automobiles" instead...you'll have a much better time.

4 out of 10.this film was neither funny as a whole nor was it even worthing investing any kind of emotion into the characters. eugene levy is probably the most funny.... the rest of the cast do their jobs, but the story never really gets very deep and there are a lot of holes in the plot that never get filled. this just wasn't very much fun, despite being funny at times.

hollywood will stop at nothing to make money on a film even if they have to keep dragging out stereotypes and putting them in the most impossible and stupid situations. this effort is a clear example of that and i really do believe in my heart that a film like this is racially irresponsible. story is about a divorced lawyer named peter sanderson (steve martin) who has been chatting with a lady on his computer and when he finally meets her she turns out to be the opposite of what he was expecting. charlene morton (queen latifah) is a stocky black woman who has no intentions of dating peter but instead wants him to look at her case where she was convicted of robbery. he wants her to leave for good but she keeps popping up at inappropriate times and to save his job he reluctantly agrees to look at the facts involving her case.*****spoiler alert*****peter has his kids staying with him and charlene turns out to be helpful in raising them but suddenly a news bulletin announces that an escaped convict named charlene morton has broken out of prison. peter tells her to leave when the fbi comes snooping around but he figures out that she is in fact innocent when her old boyfriend shows up and threatens him.this film is directed by adam shankman who keeps things moving at a nice pace and it is a good looking film technically speaking but the script is just so improbable and every character is a stereotype to the point that a 1970 film called "the landlord" is clearly more in tune with race relations than this mess. i have always been a big fan of martin and i think he's one of the most talented persons around but he loves to work constantly and at times just seems to pick any script handed to him. on the other hand, i've always had a problem with latifah and the way she barges into the life of martin is so over the top that she instantly becomes ingratiating. basic premise that hollywood loves to use is the hip black person showing uptight whitey to loosen up and then pass on some street logic that will help them with their lives. that's basically what the story is here but of course they have to let martin dress black and overact like a retarded eminem because hollywood knows that this is what viewers want. well, i was pretty much insulted by everything in this film and it's not because i don't have a sense of humor but unfortunately (for hollywood, anyway) i use logic and common sense when i watch a film. yes, i enjoyed eugene levy's talking jive but are we really suppose to believe that he would be instantly attracted to latifah? i guess weirder things have happened and how many times does a main actor get shot only to be saved by something in their pocket? wouldn't a cell phone shatter if struck by a bullet? even if your the most die hard martin and latifah fan i wouldn't recommend this. i know i've said this before but this isn't an attempt to make a good film, it's an excuse to try and make money!

steve martin looks like he's had a face lift. something very strange about his face. i usually like anything steve does, but this movie comes off as trashy not funny. didn't think charlene encouraging him to be rough with his wife was a good message to be sending out to teens watching this film.

this was one of the worst films i can remember seeing. i am sure i have seen worse, though, if that mitigates me slamming it.the humor isn't funny, there are stupid stereotype jokes that, again, aren't funny. i was a captive audience on a plane and viewed this film. it was a complete waste of time. i enjoyed martin in earlier films, but not this one. same for queen latifah, she was excellent in chicago and in set it off she was good too, but this role was horrid.i mostly credit the failure to the bad writing of the script. i feel strongly you can't save a formulaic, unfunny script with decent actors, this movie as a case in point. still, all involved should have been wise enough to not participate in this film. i am just amazed that something so bad can get greenlighted, made, released theatrically, and promoted.

talk about your wild life. barely a b-movie, but what the hay...corny sci-fi and lesbian sex. from the mind of writer and director cody jarrett, a cheesy slice of fun. a chemical company is dumping waste that is causing mutants in a fish farm. the hot kristi russell stars as dr. barbara michaels, an epa agent sent to investigate this environmental dilemma. she just happens to enter a lesbian relationship with bartender trixie(ariadne shaffer)and their love scenes are about as good as this film gets. a man-size frog incites chaos; causing a car crash, raping the chemical company boss's daughter, raping a girl under the bleachers at a football game, stiff-arm tackling a runner in the football game, raping a nun...all before being shot twice in the chest after an antidote was found all ready. the special effects...well, not special; a guy in a rubber frog costume without the genitalia to prove himself. tough tadpoles, do you still want to watch it? go ahead, but bribe any witness to secrecy.

i was truly looking forward to this title. it sounded and looked fun. the idea of someone making a cheesy 50s monster movie could have been worth a few laughs, but instead this title only bores. first off, there is almost no froggg in the entire movie which is the biggest disappointment. i have to sit through 75+ minutes of lame drama and dialog to get a few glimpses of the froggg humping a bare breasted chick. why? on top of that the film lacks any sort of fun plot. i mean give me something thats a bit more interesting than just a bunch of talking heads. i wanted to see some hot chicks search for the creature in the swamp, i wanted to see some cuties dragged off to his lair in desperate need of rescue (creature from the black lagoon stuff), i wanted to see a few goofy action scenes of the froggg going on a killing spree, or it maybe escaping a silly trap. something exciting! geez, have fun with it, be creative! who wants to sit through endless and tiring dialog scenes in a creature flick? my advice to the filmmakers: keep going, your concepts are good, but your execution needs to be a lot more inspired. have some fun with the creature, put the humor in the action and most important...put more creature in a creature movie!!!

i had high hopes when i went into the theatre-- having seen the trailer i was as hyped as the next person to see great talent participate in the making of a story with a beautiful premise.however, it's disappointing to see this talent laid waste by the poor composition of songs-the words are chunky and cheesy, probably because it was composed with a more western theme. i wouldn't find it difficult to imagine the same melodies with french or english lyrics. in mandarin, they just sound strange.the musical items were also cut together badly-- far too quickly to be enjoyable, and the shots of the actors looking anguished lasted far too long.the special effects are the next disappointment. suffice it to say, it is highly obvious where the special effects start and stop.it's not moulin rouge, and it's not in the mood either, inspite of the occasional (and very similar) slow waltz theme. altogether, and hour too long to tell a simple story.

the only thing romantic about this movie is the pain and anguish of romance. if you are expecting this cinematic adaptation of another nicholas sparks novel to follow the surefire formula of previous films, such as "message in a bottle," "nights at rodanthe," and "a walk to remember," think again. nobody dies from an accident trying to save somebody else and the romance here doesn't transform these characters. if anything, it makes them even more miserable than they were.a soft-spoken special forces army sergeant, john tyree (channing tatum of "g.i. joe"), has a memorable two-week fling while on leave from the military with an impressionable college girl, savannah curtis (radiant amanda seyfriend of "mamma mia"), who is spending spring break in south carolina. savannah doesn't drink, smoke, but she tells john that her head is filled with profanity. inevitably, john and savannah topple madly in love with each other and launch an endless exchange letters of love letters that are sleep-inducing by any standard. tyree is off in the world serving the military in some godforsaken corner of the globe while she is away at college perusing his letters in class. just as they are getting hot and heavy between them, suicidal terrorists crash planes into the world trade center. john reenlists along with his buddies in a wave of patriotism without discussing the option with savannah.meanwhile, another guy, shaggy but likable family friend tim (henry thomas of "e.t.: the extra-terrestrial") who has a motherless, autistic child named alan becomes the object of savannah's sentiment. she is the kind of girl who helps build houses for the less fortunate and wants to start a summer horse ranch for autistic children. she delays what seems forever before she finally contacts tyree with the eponymous letter. indeed, she dumps him for a man with a disease! later, she confesses to john that she knew the sound of his voice would have broken her resolve to marry tim, so she doesn't make that fateful call. predictably, john agonizes over savannah's lack of communication. during a routine mission, our hero takes a couple of terrorist bullets in the back and winds up in germany. while all this is transpiring, tyree is trying to come to terms with his own coin-collecting father, mr. tyree (richard jenkins of "step brothers"), who suffers from asperger's syndrome. it seems that his father is on his last legs after john gets out of the hospital. the lead female character lacks a shred of respect and her betrayal of tyree amounts to a pretty low blow. tyree, his father, and tyree's commander, keith robinson, are the only sympathetic characters in this long distance epistolary romance. "dear john" gives new meaning to lethargic love stories. yuck!

ok, it's watchable if you are sick in bed or have nothing else to do. the suspension of disbelief required to get through this movie is significant though. first, in today's modern society do you believe college coeds get that committed to someone in that short of a period of time even if you are a "virtuous" habitat volunteer who likes autistic kids? and the 2 week romance blossoms into a letter exchange that leads to john's "conflict" of whether to re-enlist right after 9/11/01...really? he asks her what to do? every guy we know was not gonna be sitting on the sidelines after those towers came down(my husband was one of them and i love him and am proud of him for going) john's character is so flat. he's nearly expressionless the entire movie. he's good looking but not spec ops...he seems unsure not confident, quiet instead of a hell-raiser, no tattoos, gets into a "fight" with the preppy boys that is nothing more than a pushing match really...walks around without a cover on his head nearly the whole movie...and there are military technical flaws everywhere (epaulets upside down?). the war scenes are dumb...john and another guy heading off on their own...huh?, then other guy gets shot and john drags him 10 feet and starts giving buddy aid before securing the area or back-up arrival or even having their backs against cover...it's a gunfight for god's sakes, you don't stop fighting until its over...heck i wanted to shoot john in the back. back home, when the truth is revealed and she spills the wine...we hated her for removing her shirt in his presence...wth? break his heart and then tease him into adultery? she's a head case trollop. best part of the movie is when he drives away from her...at least he had some self respect and honor there. overall unbelievable story and we generally did not care about these characters or their love. dismal!

i was extremely excited for this movie! my expectations were under control because i read the book first sooo i expected differences. what i didn't expect were how great the differences were. starting off by the characters physical appearances...like channing tantums lack of tattoos n amanda seyfried not being a brunette lol but i let that go...the character developments were not there at all...you didn't have time to love amanda seyfried character and you couldn't feel for her or for john when they first separated...i thought the two weeks were rushed and i hated that she left first then him...it took the emotional separation away...and why did they change tim from the book...why did they make him a dad instead of a brother and why did they make him sooo old looking and the movie lacked that intense moment when they find out what happens at the end (didnt want to spoil it lol but for those who watched it u know what i mean) and whhhyyyy ooooo wwhyyyy did they change the ending...in the book it was heartbreaking and emotional and it emphasized on channing tatums character's decision whhyyy did they twist it...it just made it look like a rushed ending...it was terrible...thats what disappointed me the most...the ending of the book should have been exactly the same :(

today, being president's day, my wife and i had "the notebook" dvd, checked out at our local library. it's a movie released in 2004 that fell beneath our radar, as we are big movie goers. i'm a published author with hopes of screen playing my first book. i'd noticed references to "the notebook" in reviews of other movies which is why i brought it up about us watching and this morning provided the perfect opportunity. we both really liked it. it made my wife cry; we could relate to many things in it with our own, continuing love affair and even i fought back choking up.this afternoon, after lots of chores, yard work and eating, we decided to actually catch a matinée. when we got to the theater, having seen most of the current batch of films playing, we elected to see "victoria day" which for some reason was not at the theater, even though both imdb and my phone movies showed it playing there. so, instead we looked at the poster for "dear john" and that it was written by the same writer as "the notebook", making it the obvious choice as we enjoyed 'tn' so much.what a disappointment! first, the characters did not have the same believability or sense of empathy as 'tn'; and we kept commenting throughout all the similarities -- two dozen or so -- quickly causing us to realize this movie was nothing but, as another reviewer commented, "a poor man's notebook!" it had a real 'cash cow' feeling, meaning the sparks simply threw a story together, based on the exact template of 'tn' simply to make a quick buck. not only that, after the 'bug-eyed' trollop improbably 'dear john's-john' for the wimp cancer patient, we ridiculed the movie with each, passing soapy stupid line all the way through to the end. there were only about 6 of us in the theater during this 4:45pm monday matinée and my wife even told me to keep it down so i wouldn't ruin it for the others...it was so bad.seeing this on the heels of 'tn' ensured that the rip off similarities were vividly recognizable and sparks blatant, cheap attempt at template writing painfully obvious. we only wish we could've seen "victoria day" instead...no matter how bad it might've been after seeing this poor entry to cinema. and oh..., for the last 30-minutes, i kept saying "...don't give that cow the coins ...don't give that cow the coins?"

ok, let's start with the good: nice scenery, channing tatum is easy to look at, amanda seyfried has nice hair, that's about it. how much of this movie went on the editing room floor? probably the plot, action, good dialogue, and point. terrible acting, horrible choppy dialogue. let me tell you how bad it is: my friend who always cries at movies got to the part that was meant to evoke tears, and she laughed so hard we thought she was crying! the movie seems to want to take a stab at too many issues- war, loss, autism, cancer, but fails so miserably to cover any one topic satisfactorily. make sure you have something to munch on and your cell phone to return text messages!

after reading the reviews i am so relieved to know that i am not the only person who was very disappointed in this movie! i am a huge nicholas sparks fan, have read all of his books, most of them more than once. of course i loved the notebook and a walk to remember...i haven't yet seen message in a bottle or nights in rodanthe so i can't comment on those...but i did go see dear john this past weekend and i was terribly upset! the movie was not good at all! when looking at the movie alone, and not thinking about the book at all, it was still a terrible movie. i did not get the rush and range of emotions from this movie that i have got from other movies i enjoyed, especially the notebook. i was not smiling and laughing and crying and worried and scared...ever! from the very beginning all i could notice was how they changed everything! the only thing about this movie that is similar to the book is that there is a guy named john who is in the military and a girl named savannah who is not....the part about his dad being obsessed with coins is about the only other part that went along with the book. everything else was totally off!!!! first of all, in the book, allen was tim's little brother, not his son! why they had to change that, i don't understand. it made a lot more sense how it went in the book when tim was just a little bit older than savannah and they grew up together and allen was savannah's inspiration for wanting to work with horses and autistic children....that didn't happen in the movie....ugh...and in the book they spent a lot more time together than just those initial 2 weeks and then the 1 night...why did they leave those times out??? i could go on and on and on but then i would run out of space! so basically, if you are a great fan of nicholas sparks, don't waste your time or money on this movie...just read the book again...because it's terrible and nothing like the book!

the production value of avp2 can be described by one adjective: awfulthe script is ridiculous, even in the fictional area of avp: what are the facehuggers good for on the predator's ship? why is the predator cleaning up all signs of his influence and than wasting precious time with eviscerating and even presenting the body of an insignificant human cop? why is the predator alone? why is the predator equipping himself only on earth but on his home planet? why does the predator make his job so uneasy for himself by hunting down the aliens rather than bombing the whole countryside like the humans do in the end? why is the predator dropping more & more of his few weapons rather than collecting them to keep them together after using one. in the end he is even dropping his armor before fighting the predalien in hand to hand combat: what a bad plagiarism of the first predators final fight between arny and the predator. the predator's gestures are so exaggerated that he is moving more like a japanese sumo than like highly skilled extraterrestrial-safari-hunter. as one can see immediately the whole story is a mess. but it gets even worse because this botched-up job is filled up with boring patchwork of senseless interludes like a lengthy pizza ordering episode or some detailed information about the criminal past of the two brothers (dallas & ricky). the sheriff is of course the friend of these two criminals who he puts regularly behind bars. (not convincing & absolutely superfluous for the plot).in addition to that the cast of actors is horrible. compared to the high class of directors & actors of the former aliens or predator movies avp2 is an embarrassingly bad piece of crap.at last the action of the movie is really poor. there is not a single scene of action combat in which the audience can see the whole set. each and every fight is filmed in short & shaky bursts with close up zoom at nearly full darkness. that results in an atrocious experience for the audience because one can mostly see nothing but a dark shaky screen.i suggest the two directing brothers strause to buy themselves a steadycam and get a lesson in modern cg so that the next film contains some visible action of visible figures and might not need to disguise their bad directing abilities in such a manner.i would advise anybody (even die hard avp fans) against watching this film: prefer the first one or the original aliens or the original predator films but avoid disappointing yourself by wasting your precious time on this failure.

this entry doesn't contain a spoiler. it doesn't have to. the movie is as predictable as the sunrise. the element in the first alien movies was the suspense that something could happen. this was so in the first two predator movies, though less prevalent. requiem has totally removed the element of suspense and replaced it with blood and gore. you know people are going to die (well duh, it is a avsp movie), but you know who is going to die and when they are going to die, and where they are going to die before it happens. the directors should take a lesson from hitchcock who said, "suspense is not a time bomb going off under a table. suspense is a bomb not going off under the table". what's the sense in going to a movie when you know exactly what is going to happen and when? if you really, really want to watch this movie, wait until it comes out on video and then rent it, but by no means would i ever buy it.

the review on the main page admits that the movie is horrible but that you should forgive it because it is nicely violent. no you shouldn't. there are spoilers at the end of this review but how i can "spoil" this rotten movie i have no idea. even if you are a die hard alien/pred fan like i am wait for the dvd. it isn't worth a 3.99 rental either but you'll be much less inclined to truly hate this film if you pay that than 12 bucks or better per person plus concession purchases at a theater.in the theater i watched avpr there were exactly two laughs, both by a girl sitting next to me. other than that there was total silence throughout. no ooohs, or "that was bad ass!", nothing. imagine being a patient on an operating table and just being given the anesthetic. now you know what you'll feel like in the theater after the opening scene of avpr.what was the budget on this movie? like war of the worlds, mi 3, and other f/x driven movies the director seems far more involved in what the cgi people can come up with than developing characters or a plot. spielberg has tried and failed at this several times, usually with tom cruise. sure the movies make money but should they? war of the worlds and minority report had the budget to pay for a decent script, tom cruise et al, and ss himself but were still awful. i'm sure avp wasted 90% of their budget on cg and had no choice but to hire any actor that would say yes even though the casting agent would have done better by going to the supermarket and picking actors at random.there is no tension developed in any scene so we are never close to being surprised. who cares who gets killed? we didn't know any of them, we all know what happens when the lil aliens make their corporeal exit, we all know the blood is acid. in alien, aliens, 3, resurrection, and even avp the directors make use of the fact that the aliens can think, can hide and can lay traps. this director decided that the ridley scott, james cameron, and others were idiots for developing characters you actually want to see either live or get killed. in this installment you will never care who lives or dies, not a kid, a parent, a pregnant woman. the characters serve only one purpose in this movie, to die. the opening scenes establish the fact that the movie is going to be a predictable joke. the character development scenes mix clichés, bad humor, and bad acting and numb the viewer to the point where we really don't care if they get killed so long as they die in never before seen ways. but they don't. the director tried to make something different from those who preceded him in the alien franchise but only succeeded in discarding the good parts of the first films, the human protagonists, and stealing the rest from other recent sci-fi films.there is not one original use of the either the alien or pred characters. the pred actually has little trouble killing aliens by the dozen even though the last movie led us to believe that pred revered the aliens as such a deadly foe that they used the killing of one as rite of passage. the alienpred is never really developed as a fearsome creature. its ability to inject parasites into a host is ripped from several different movies most recently probably was hellboy where samiel's dismembered tongue injected eggs into hellboy or doom where the mutated creatures would leave their tongues behind after they speared a victim's throat.simply put we aren't given reason to care about anything in this movie. there is violence but it doesn't shock or surprise and is nothing that hasn't been seen in any of a hundred slasher flicks. the cg is ok and both species of alien are made to look and move as they have in movies past. but since the characters are never developed and the acting is so bad we kind of hope that they all die. the little girl was probably the best actor of the bunch but sadly we aren't made to care whether or not kids, women, or anyone else lives or dies. we just want the movie to end. eventually it does but not before another stolen plot line from resident evil 2 has a nuke aim gunnison's way to wipe out the "infection". and not before yet another stupid scene that is supposed to open the door for further sequels but does it? in a movie filled with bad scenes the worst may have been saved for last.sorry for the repetition but everything bears repeating: bad script, no plot, unoriginal action scenes, uninspired direction, abysmal acting, decent f/x that were wasted because of the many flaws.i don't mind going to an indie film and being disappointed. the actors and directors and crew are probably getting their careers going and working on a shoestring budget. for a movie with this type of budget and hype i feel cheated along with disappointed. this movie is a painfully boring waste of time from the opening scene to closing credits. sad to say that a preview of hellboy 2 was the best part of avpr and hb2 didn't even look that good.

i really, really don't understand how that movie could get a rating bigger than 4 here on imdb. it's simply a huge mess, and i have to admit that i actually liked avp 1: close to no story, okay, i can live with that, but at least they got to the point pretty much at once. avp 2 does not. after the stupid premise has been presented there is well over half an hour of stupid and unfitting teenager clichés, dumb as hell dialog and close to nothing else, except for a few alien scenes that feel like an excuse to have that first half of the movie and predator scenes that make you ask yourself whether those guys making the film even watched any other predator movie or just didn't care enough to be bothered.after that, that crap-fest finally gets to the point where the predator starts attacking the aliens, or at least pretends doing so. and boy, is that predator stupid, blind and deaf. it's awful. how he even managed to earn that stuff he has is beyond me. he misses with almost every shot, only notices aliens when they're right in his face or if it's absolutely necessary for the script, so that he can move where he has to be. he even gets caught on surprise by puny human teenagers and deputies all of the time. what's that guy supposed to be? after the first hour of that abomination i was more or less constantly shaking my head at every scene. close to no scene in this movie passes by without unbelievably stupid dialogs, stupid predator actions or stupid lack there-of or stupid actions from our "heroes".then, that thing finally ended. to my surprise not only me and my friends didn't know whether to laugh or to cry, but everybody i overheard leaving the room was half-crying, half-laughing about those 1 1/2 hours they just wasted.don't watch. never.

i love b movies, but i like to be aware from the beginning that i'm watching one. i can't believe someone could mess up a movie about aliens and predators so bad. aliens and predator are awesome. this movie made a big joke out of them. the creators didn't take this movie seriously at all. i am throughly disappointed in how the strauss jerks handled this film. they made a mockery of amazing characters. it's like they were trying to be serious in the beginning, then their writers got high and gave up. almost nothing was continuous, the main characters were awful and were not aliens or predators. i am so ridiculously sad that no one takes alien and predators seriously anymore. these characters are icons of american pop culture and the creators of this movie showed no respect to the original films. they should not be allowed to cash in on the names of the previous films and they should be ashamed of themselves

from what i understand, fox was embarrassed they released a pg-13 alien/predator movie not so long ago. it was not well received by any means.not exactly sure where to go next, seeing as they thought anderson was the best director for the franchise and they had produced a true sci-fi gem, fox turned to it's small, but knowledgeable group of monkeys for answers.these monkeys were by no means veterans of writing sci-fi flicks, but had seen burton's planet of the apes remake and house of the dead. their first task: hire actors. fox gave them a reasonable budget but the monkeys wanted to save the money. they hired fifteen tv actors shortly after.now, the script. the monkeys wanted to save more of the budget so they wrote the movie themselves. leaving out important aspects of the two franchises was the easy part. thinking of great new lines for the general audience to remember years down the line - that was more difficult. they butted heads awhile and came up with a truly award-winning screenplay equipped with cliché characters, idiotic decisions an gaping plot holes.fox was pleased thus far with the results but wanted to see what was to become of the centerpieces to the film - the aliens and predators. the monkeys again wanted to save money in the budget so they decided to trash the great robotics used in the otherwise terrible avp original and go with the man-in-the-suit alien seen in the old films. the actors playing the aliens had trouble fitting into the suits as they weren't properly sized by the monkeys so they jiggled their plastic heads throughout the film with honor. as for the predators, the monkeys decided one predator was enough this time around (again, saving budget) to fight the hordes of aliens that seemingly come out of nowhere. but what about the effects, you ask? come on now, people. they may be monkeys but they clearly knew cgi would play a key role in the film. without diving into the budget, the monkeys used a standard final cut program and cut and pasted some very nice fire and spark effects throughout. putting red and green filters over the camera lens provided some excellent predator visions.the setting was something the monkeys thought long and hard about. if this was to be on earth, in colorado of all places, they needed to make it realistic. this was where they admitted they might have made a mistake. see, the monkeys didn't have proper training in this department so they thought turning the lights off in the city and having the movie play out in the dead of night and in the rain was the right thing to do. they simply forgot people like to see the creatures instead of looking at shadows and rain the whole film. to add insult to injury, the monkeys accidentally filmed all the fight scenes incredibly close so no one could see what was fighting or who it was. but again, rookie mistake.the rating. fox told the monkeys to make the movie r-rated. that was easy. without showing how many of the injuries or deaths actually happened, the monkeys made a habit of showing the carnage after the fact. it was simple: the viewers got the gore they desired and the monkeys didn't have to film the majority of action shots involving that violence.some of the actors originally had questions concerning the screenplay. why does a blue liquid the predator has endless amounts of magically disintegrate whatever he wants it to and nothing more than that? why is an ex-convict driving around in a police car the entire movie? why did the monkeys forget to show a full body shot of the aliens? why does a clock play a more memorable role than any of the main characters? the list of questions just kept growing but the monkeys ignored them and finished their masterpiece. fox was thrilled with their work. so thrilled that they opened the movie nationwide on christmas day and even spent a few bucks advertising it the week before it came out. the monkeys had successfully made another installment in these cherished franchises.but some ask, what ever happened to the budget the monkeys forgot to use? they put it towards their next film: aliens vs. predator vs. hulk hogan. they knew the general public would be upset with the title but they have since released this statement:"to the people- do not worry about our upcoming film. it will be rated r and will have violence."and everyone lived happily ever after. the end.

this frothy romantic comedy is based on the kind of story i loved as a teenager, but now find rather distasteful. in the case of may-september attachments, doubtless what is on the mind of the elder party is either lust, or an inability to face the reality of aging, or both. and the younger is most likely looking for the kind parent that she (or he) lacked as a child. these underlying agendas seem more pathetic than romantic to me now; there is also something rather predatory about them.dick powell looked a bit embarrassed--as well he should--at playing the elder lover in this silly story. he was, at fifty, attempting the role of a thirty-eight-year-old man romancing a teen-ager. but young debbie reynolds was a knockout--pretty and saucy and full of vinegar--as a misbehaving seventeen-year-old presented as a kind of "gift" to the morally upright and honest screenwriter, as a subject for him to study. her spirited performance wrung from me a better rating than this film would otherwise deserve. anne francis was cast as powell's beautiful, but brittle fiancée, and handled her small role deftly.some of the dialogue was quite amusing, too, so it's not a total washout.5/10

a ridiculous comedy given an arms-flailing direction. i love one of the comments here: "couldn't be made today". well, neither could "the philadelphia story" without a car chase or two. nonetheless, does that mean the picture is worse for the wear for being old-fashioned? i don't think "susan slept here" was good for any generation and it should fester peacefully in the memories of debbie reynolds-buffs. there is no sparkle in this story of a screenwriter who latches onto a much-younger girl for 'script research'. dick powell makes his farewell screen appearance in what must have been an embarrassment to him. reynolds is pallid. produced by one harriet parsons--who gives her famous mother louella a number of inane plugs. *1/2 from ****

this is the kind of film that i am wondering why anybody would have considered doing it from the beginning. this is the kind of movie that i cannot understand how people put money in it, how the rental store can put the dvd on its shelves. this is the kind of movie i blame myself for having rented it. there are good class-b movies, and i do not reject the genre. when they are good, they catch the interest with the action, they have characters written well enough, and acted well enough so that you can care about them. the effects in some of these movies support the film in many cases, and you may like them for the originality. almost nothing is true in 'coronado'. the subject and the script is at the level of cheap comics - just a cliche. the effects are cheap - and i do not care that the film is low budget - you can do a lot with low budget, but you need some talent. there are so many continuity and other directing errors as in ten other films. you do not care for the characters, you do not laugh, and at the end of the film you are left wondering if the parody was intentional or not. the only quality i could find is the scenery, there are some good locations, worth a much better film. 2/10 on my personal scale. the worst film of the year so far.

i obtained this little piece of scuzz on the videoasia "tales of voodoo" dvd label. quite where the voodoo is supposed to fit in, i have no idea. indeed i would not usually connect voodoo with indonesia anyway (let alone with wips).i know and love wip movies. i have seen most of them. i could not therefore resist this little known gem from the description given to it on the cover.it is appalling. you cannot have a wip movie if the women keep their clothes on (even in the shower!). although it gives a nod to the exploitation genre, wip without nudity is like a big mac without the beef.as my gym teacher used to say, on the whole, i'd rather be at the disco....

**warning - this review may contain spoilers ** the idea behind the character of danny (jet li) is a good one - young boy is taken by hoodlum and raised to behave like a vicious pitbull, controlled mainly by whether his collar is on or off his neck.however, the writer did not know how to deliver this idea within the constraints of believability.he has danny meeting a blind pianist, sam (morgan freeman), who has to be the most trusting fool a man ever was - along with his nit-wit, endlessly babbling, rather unattractive step-daughter, victoria (kerry condon). i was stunned, by the way, when i learned victoria was supposed to be 18 - she looked 25 or 30 to me.amazingly there is no romance between danny and victoria.when danny turns up again, wounded, what does sam do but take him straight home. danny is out for 2 days, but do these nit-wits take him to a hospital? nooooo. i don't know if they even called in a doctor.now danny is obviously not a mentally stable person, this is apparent from the get-go, yet sam takes him into his home, where both he and his step-daughter could have been seriously harmed or even killed by this rather strange, young man.why morgan freeman took this insipid role in this asinine film i can't even begin to guess. surely mr. freeman is not that desperate for a paycheck.then we have bob hoskins as bart, the gangster who "owns" danny - now you talk about a son of a gun that's hard to kill. the car bart is in gets riddled with bullets that would have rivaled bonnie and clyde's demise. we think he's dead, but no.then we have another car accident - and yet again, ol' bart escapes unscathed.in addition to that, we also have danny fighting half a dozen tough guys at a time, plus a scene where danny has decided he doesn't want to fight any more. i don't care how much a person doesn't want to fight, when it is down to the wire of you fight or you die, i think anyone would fight.as i said in the subject heading - this film is about 40 miles outside the boundary of reality as we have come to know it. it's not just a case of suspending belief - it's completely beyond that.furthermore i never did understand why danny's mother who turns out to be a nice lady, rather than the prostitute bart claimed she is, became mixed up with bart and his gang and got shot. maybe that was my fault, i got distracted right about the time that scene came on--but it seemed highly unlikely she and bart would have ever crossed paths.4 stars out of 10 - and that's being generous.

apart from the beautiful imagery thanks to new zealand cinematographer alun bollinger, this film is not worth seeing.the storyline is so fragmented and lost that it's hard to know what is going on at any given time, and just when you think you're following then the direction changes again, like a lost bi-polar puppy dog.the musical score is awful, relying too heavily on extremely emotive pieces that try to force the audience into feeling a certain way, as if the instruments were acting as an emotions queue sheet  'feel sad here'; 'feel shocked here'; 'feel scared here'. on top of that, the repetitive samples used over and over again leave the audience on the verge of laughter.gone are the days of silent film, where musical instruments were the sole portrayal of voice  but you wouldn't think so while watching river queen.the voice-over was so over-utilised that one has to wonder if this film really even needed any accompanying imagery. it could have easily been a radio play although even then it would be hard to follow the story.and the stolen ideas from jane campion's the piano are too obvious to overlook. not only are the beach and forest shots almost identical to those in the piano  perhaps some of this comes down to alun bollinger's camera work on the latter  but the voice-over feeling and levels too are strikingly close. and who could forget when holly hunter's character has her wings clipped, in the form of her index finger being cut off by sam neill. does it remind you of when wiremu has his 'trigger finger' amputated, and surprisingly too with an axe? i thought so.all in all i cannot recommend this film for viewing, unless you wear some ear-muffs and just go with the scenery in mind.

river queen's sound recordist should have been fired, in this day and age there is no excuse for poor recording on the set. mumbling voices was the end result, and the cinematography was average to fair at best. the story had potential and i feel sorry for the overseas actors who must have known they were on a turkey shoot while they were filming. its obvious that the movie was suffering from el cheapo budget syndrome, and the scene where temuera is procreating inside the house while a battle rages outside is just too stupid for words. i noticed a few shortcuts taken on the maori protocol side of things, but this was probably due to movie length time restraints etc. all in all i wasn't impressed with this movie, the whanganui river has many beautiful spots but this movie gives us a cold, drab and claustrophobic image, with none of the beauty. the movie needed more sunshine and better camera angles, less on screen confusion, better sound recording, and more thought needed to be put into what the movie goers would be seeing on the big screen. hats off to all involved though for completing what must have been a very difficult shoo. i have the utmost appreciation for anyone who can make a feature film, sadly i did not enjoy this one.

wow, i just got one watching this.how crappy post production is on this movie.i kid you not, i literally could've done a better job myself.all of post production is flawed, all of it. whoever cut this film should be banned from the film industry.that aside, the script was a trainwreck. absolute rubish.not to mention jack bauer and his patchy the pirate in spongebob accent. wtf is his character doing there? but to me, the biggest flaw of all was character development, intereaction, dynamics, dialogue. wow. i cant believe how bad it was.i give this movie a 2 out of 10. 1 for samantha, who is a great actress, too bad the production made everyone look like amateurs out there.the other 1 goes to cinematography, which was indeed good.other then that my friend, this is one bad movie.i don't even feel like making an elaborate post on this, it was just horrible production. poor actors, didn't know what they were getting into...

this is by far one the most boring movies i've ever seen! and if you don't believe me go ahead and watch it for yourself.the movie starts of slow, the storyline makes no sense at all. people fighting doesn't make any sense. i could not make sense of what they were talking during the movie (in most cases i didn't even bother) it does nothing to keep you watching the movie, the only plus point would be the cinematography. new zealand looks awesome. everything else just plain sucks.the actors try their best to keep us awake, but unfortunately you will go to sleep instead.do us all a favor, even if this gets on "on demand", don't watch it!

for weeks i had been looking forward to seeing this movie only to find myself hugely disappointed after wards. in my opinion, the only good thing 'river queen' had going for it was the amazing scenery used as backgrounds. the story line was all over the place, samantha's character sarah was very difficult to understand and what on earth were all the many close ups of her face for? it brought absolutely nothing to the story-if there was one at all!a better actor for the part of boy could also have been selected, to me it sounded like he read his lines straight of the script while shooting his scenes.overall, a real shame as it could have been such a good movie.

wait... wait... wait... wait... wait... wait..... what!? this movie is terrible, absolutely terrible. 1. the only reason kiefer sutherland is on the cover is to sell it to kiefer fans, only to have their hearts broken. he kills one guy, gets shot, and dies before half the movie is over, not to mention he was only in the first 10 min and then disappeared until the point which he died...why put him on the cover if his character blows. 2. where are the epic battle scenes promised in the preview on the back cover? 3. it was way too confusing, i mean whats up with the girl? she had to narrate the movie to try to get our attention, she failed! 4. if kiefer dies in a movie..... it fails. now i am going to go watch 24..... this movie fails!

i was really looking forward to this movie but sadly it didn't live up to expectation.a good movie has the audience identifying/empathising/sympathising with the main actor. unfortunately this was very hard to do with samantha morton.the storyline seemed very disjointed and didn't flow as it should/could have done.keifer sutherland appeared to be little more than window dressing and made me wonder why he agreed to play what appeared to be a bit part. beautiful scenery and the acting of tem morrison and cliff curtis was about the only plus.maybe by being a kiwi i set the bar higher for locally made films. maybe the change of director/ supposedly hard to work with main actor has biased my opinion.maybe i'm just trying to make excuses for a movie which could have been great.a lot of maybes which still does not explain why this movie just lacked anything special.it could have been great, it wasn't.

a good example of reversed, politically correct racism where white men are presented as senseless brutes who're only there to be massacred and their aboriginal adversaries as noble heroes, superior both in their appearance and abilities. apart from making the story overally dull, this also prevents the neutral viewer to identify himself with one or the other side - it's just too simplifying. the repetitive score is incredibly annoying (as is the voice-over), the characters lack any depth and the viewer is soon lost between questions like "who is this character" and "what the hell is that supposed to mean". photography is wonderful, though, and on the whole there's a lot of atmosphere to it but nice shots of misty landscapes alone don't save this movie. the dvd box uses kiefer sutherland as an eye-catcher. in fact, his character could have been played by anyone else because it's basically just an empty shell (like most non-maori characters), and disappears anyway around halfway the film. but if you are eager to see jack bauer in a kilt, that's your kind of movie...

this was one of the dullest movies i have seen in some time. i'm in my late 40s, and watched it with my son-in-law (early 20s) and son (17). the scenery was beautiful, but the story was a bust. we watched about an hour of it and turned it off. i spent more time on my iphone during the hour that we watched it than i spent actually watching the movie. i gave it a 3 because i enjoyed the scenery and cinematography; otherwise i would have given it a 1. i'm sure there are people who are really into the "art" of it all who will find my review appalling but we're all entitled to our own opinions, right? i couldn't figure out if this was supposed to be a "chick flick" where the focus was on the mother, or if it was supposed to be a movie for guys, with the focus on battle and adventure. in my opinion, it didn't succeed in either.

with an interesting premise (in the conflicts between europeans and indigenous peoples sometimes the battle lines were not so clear), this should have been a good film. but the story is sabotaged by the director's overriding infatuation with his own cleverness twinned with a very poor script.yes, the natural setting is beautiful and, yes, the movie is authentic to its 19th century historical setting. but the filmmaker keeps gilding the lily over and over again, adding layer upon layer of over-the-top musical accompaniment, not to mention a completely unnecessary voice-over, to the soundtrack, that ultimately overwhelm the viewer and, by calling attention to themselves, take away from the story.to me, it was clear the director, with his microscopic closeups and the endless recurrence of the musical motif of "danny boy" (of all things!) was trying to make a new zealand version of an epic sergio leone film, something on the order of once upon a time in the west. but given the earnestness of the story (most of leone's westerns were tongue-in-cheek), not to mention that it's no longer 1968, he succeeds in making a parody of one.too bad.

it is unsettling seeing so many people giving outrageously high ratings to this film. some of the praise uses such twisted reasoning (and transparent agendas that betray a simple love of anything that is in any way critical of the u.s.) that it approaches hysteria.heaven's gate is a bad movie, it is fundamentally awful. endless scenes using elaborate shots that serve no purpose, muddy dialogue, murky narative, no sense of any theme aside from excess...the high rating of this disaster is a product of revisionist history and temporary shifts in perception.for some perspective watch lawrence of arabia before watching heaven's gate. you will see just how aimless and lost this film truly is. the "issues" it may have been trying to deal with are lost in a miasma.i have no problem with films that are critical of the u.s. per se, but when a terrible film gets such undeserved praise purely because of that element... that's worth challenging.the film is worth seeing for two reasons; curiosity, and as a cautionary tale for young filmmakers.i saw this at home for free, imagine the torture of being in a theater and sitting through it... for 4 meandering hours!

attention, possible spoilersthis film is so lousy that it actually becomes funny. the director has put in all the clichés that have ever plagued b-series movies. the stupid bimbo (nice rack) getting caught again and again by the bad guys, chief villain smirky and revealing his plots before they happen so they can be ruined and who, of course, bullied/killed the hero's father in an unclear past, a side-kick in the person of a policeman - small, bald and whose only preparation for the last battle (another cliché) is returning his baseball-cap rim-backwards etc. the film's end really tops it. after the chief villain dies when the hero paralised stoneface jack or whatever throws him from the roof of a building ten stories high, they walk out of the building. which, from the exteriors, looks three stories high only and very much like your regular city hall. when they exit the building, the side-kick can't walk, being that his right leg appears to be wounded. how, nobody can tell: ten minutes earlier he fell down shot in his shoulder and his feet were fine. there is no further explanation for the inquisitive mind of the viewer who would be curious to know such trivial things as "where is the villain's body which should lay near the building?" and "why is there no police or even curious folks gathered round the said body?". i could go on forever with the list. why does another one of the bad guys claim to have invented martial arts when he gets his ass kicked in no time? why do bad guys in general make silly movements when attacking? why does the hero look so faggy? is there anyone really thinking "yes, these characters and this plot makes this a film to remember"? and the actors suck. our hero and saviour of the day wears the same expression on his face. the whole film. that disgusted-trying to be cocky smirk must be some copyrighted feat of him.also, thinking that until now 12% of the people having rated this film gave it a 10 makes me full of fear inside. they might have been serious and then we're doomed.

i think vampire movies (usually) are wicked. even if the film itself isn't all that good, i still like it 'cos its got vampires in it. but this stinks. it really does give vampire movies a bad name.for a start, the cheapness really shows. i'm not usually that bothered about low budget films - one of my favourite all-time movies is el mariachi which only cost $7000 - but i hate this. the actions a load of crap as well, resorting to a 'stylish' wobbling camera which gives you headache.theres not much more to say other than don't watch this. i bought it for £1.50 as it was an ex-rental and i feel cheated out of my money, even for that low price.

don wilson stars as jack cutter (ooh real tough name!)a vampire slayer who goes up against a vampire army, you see the story is a little different because vampires can't be killed with silver, crosses or sunlight but rather through snapping their necks (how convenient as it cuts down on the budget) and it's here cutter runs into a reporter (melanie smith of trancers iii fame) night hunter's action sequences shake for no reason during the fight sequences and although it's meant to emphasize the mood, it just makes the movie more jarring. what is worse is that these fight sequences are botched beyond belief as wilson's martial artistry is disguised by disjointed editing. of course the most interest comes from the fact that indeed this predates blade, however the problem is that this was done on a small budget and that it had don wilson in it. it's from roger corman and basically this turkey is a movie most people would pay not to see. i unfortunately am a bottom feeder and i cater to the section of the store looking for gems, in this line of work you always run into turds. with night hunter, i just may have the world's stinkiest turd.1/2* out of 4-(awful)

pun intended. this low budget action/horror vehicle for don wilson's ability to kick things is the stuff direct-to-video fare is made of.the plot: wilson is a humorless vampire hunter who comes under fire from local law enforcement after he is forced to slaughter creatures of the night in view of the public. police chase him, vampires chase him, he responds by kicking...a lot.there is a little more to the story, but it is so inconsequential that i honestly can't remember it; i think people actually spoke in the movie, but that's up to debate. the plot is nothing more than a set-up for wilson to kill as many vampires as possible in the running time, usually by kicking them.the technical specs are, in a word, anemic. little color treating, amateurish use of lighting, simplistic use of camera and angle. blood and gore is noticeably limited, odd for this type of film. the most hurtful of the filming foul-ups is the jarring shift to super-shaky cam during each and every fight scene. if the camera begins to bounce around like a reese monkey on speed, then you know don is about to start kicking everything in sight.all in all, this is the kind of bad movie that can be made good with a few friends and a lot of cynical humor. otherwise, do not watch, unless you really like to watch things get kicked.3/10

this is really a terrible film by any of the regular yardsticks. plot, storyline, acting, effects, direction - i could go on. suffice to say it's poor. however, it has a certain appeal. many totally out of context sex scenes appear, it's fun looking for the batman references. umm - that's it. poor really, don't bother.

you have to see this movie, it's a big footnote in the history of film. when this film was made, american film industry reached the bottom of sucking. see this movie, laugh, and feel sorry for yourself for wasting the last 2 hours of your life. it's the worst acting i've seen and even worse directing. the villains laugh like they're taken from a clown circus and if the guys who did "scary movie" want to do a parody on superhero movies they only have to take the script from this movie and do a remake, called black scorpion iii: the threat of really really bad movies who in some way manages to lure the production companies into a sequel suicide.

there is part of one sequence where some water rushes into the sunken plane, everything else that happens in this movie is stock footage for airport 77. you can even make out jack lemmon and christopher lee in some of the shots. a total rip off? well almost by definition. there may be more stock footage in this film than in plan 9 from outer space.all the new material, actors sitting around in an airplane set talking, is bland and terrible on every level. dennis weaver is totally wasted in a career low movie, though that's true for everyone other than this films director fred olen ray, who uses one of this many necessary fake names in order to keep working.there is a level of scant professionalism that makes this film such a waste of time, it would actually be better if shot by someone with no technical knowledge at all, because ray has just enough knowledge about how to put together a scene in the worst old school tv fashion that this film, like most of his films, is totally devoid of life. the worst kind of hack work. the worst kind of film. boring.this type of film is a waste of money, an affair where the crew on all levels are ghosts hoping to get whatever scant pay check they can and that no one will see or know they appeared/ participated in this rip off. there are so many people who want to make movies it's disgusting to see ray burn up the money given to do nothing more but fill time.his commentary track is interesting in that he has to start it by explaining that he is really fred ray as he isn't credited on the film itself. that tricked me into seeing it don't let it trick you.

"submerged" is definitely not "the worst movie ever". it does have its flaws, such as borrowed footage, crazy script and non-existent special effects (these are the worst), but it also has some good points too. the acting is surprisingly good, there are lots of familiar faces whom you probably know if u're a b-movie fan like me.i was very glad to see brent huff playing one of the heroes, knowing him mostly for his 80's action films, and i must admit, he is not a bad actor at all. fred williamson, maxwell caulfield & tim thomerson get some limited screen time, but are believable in their parts. the "eye-candies" in this fred olen ray movie are yvette nipar and nicole eggert, both looking very sexy and very mean. michael bailey smith adds some muscle to the background as a navy seal. unfortunately the only cast member who (in my opinion) is completely out of place is coolio. he doesn't act at all, talks like he didn't even read the script, and being a badass in the beginning of the movie, gets shot like a wimp a hour later. not a good choice.to sum this movie up - this is not such a bad choice for late night entertainment. if you can get over the special effects thing (so many guns, so much fire, and not a single wound on anyone), coolio's annoying performance, and the recycled footage from airport 77, you might like this no-brainer after all.

this film has to rank down there with ed wood films. a terrible script and bad, bad acting.a machine gun fight in front of plate glass windows; minutes go by before anyone is hit and nobody has cover - not one window ever breaks. you'd think after a fire fight like that the big u-haul truck might be riddled - not a scratch.do cia agents and government contractors =shout= top secret information at a stand-up cocktail party with hundreds of people around.there isn't one actor you care about; everyone is shallow and basically unlikable.a hawaii bound 747 flies out of los angeles and crashes twenty minutes later in the pacific "...in 100 feet of water...". a short time passes when the stewardess announces to the five other passengers they only have two hours of air left; on a 747?the next day the rescue teams show-up and amazingly the six passengers are still alive.a movie that starts out mediocre and goes from bad to worse.

this is a terrible movie that only gets worse and seems to never end. the acting was bad, the plot was worse, and the special effects seemed to have been created by a 5th grade science class. dennis weaver is such a great actor and should have never taken such a part. my advise, don't watch this movie!

boring, ridicules and stupid "submerged" is a waste of time. the shootouts were a joke, real people do not just stand out in the open with out any cover, hoping to get shot first! so many things wrong or bad, not worth the effort to list, except one major flaw. at 500 mph for 20 minutes = about 166 miles west of l.a. and the water is 100ft deep??? even at that, none of the people would have survived the decompression from being subjected to 100ft of water pressure for more then 20 hours when they were brought up. just a awful.

okay, i just had to sound off on this one... like a tremendous mental-gimp, i've just sat through this film in its entirety.you'll note that the trivia section of imdb points out that portions of the raising of the 747 were "borrowed" from airport 1977. this really doesn't scratch the surface... virtually all exterior shots of the plane skimming the ocean, landing in, sinking, and even the at-rest shots are borrowed from airport '77. all of the "raising" shots are pulled from '77, including most of the interior flooding clips, with the exception of dennis weaver's drowning. i couldn't help but wonder if olivia dehavilland might come floating by at any moment, or maybe a "dead" tom sullivan. another eye-roller: dennis weaver's name in this film is stevens, which is to compensate for the fact that airport '77's plane is owned by the stevens corporation (headed by jimmie stewart of course).this is a veritable calvalcade of actors who don't work much, or at least haven't worked in a while, which might have been the first clue that it was going to be a real stinker.i've rated this film a 2 - it's quite worthy of a "1", but if this film can't offer any other redeeming quality, at least somebody helped coolio, max caulfield, nicolle eggert, and dennis weaver make their car payments that month!

this movie was one of the worst i have ever seen (not including anything by or with pauly shore). i couldn't believe that a film could actually be this bad!coolio has to be the single worst actor (again, not including pauly shore) to ever "star" in a movie. the temptation to hit the stop button during this movie was huge (in fact, if there was a throw in the trash button on my vcr, i would have been inclined to press that).do yourself a favor, and do something more interesting than watch this movie, like watching the grass grow, or watching golf on tv.

among the many accolades here for this production, there was one individual whose comments asked if he/she were the only one (who wasn't that enthralled by it) - i.e. giving this film 3 stars. however, the comment went on to indicate an overall liking of the story, and other production of same. well, this person isn't the "only one," who didn't like this production (include me!) but there i part company even with him/her. if you put a gun to my head and asked me to make a choice between your shooting me or watching this flick again, i'd watch it, certainly - but i'd probably spend 10 seconds thinking about it. i'd much prefer being locked into solitary confinement, or having to watch paint dry on a wall, though. further, i wouldn't want to see this story again, anytime, anywhere, or in any alternative presentation. sometimes you feel like comedian george gobel's "pair of brown shoes when the rest of the world is a tuxedo," and this is one of those for me. i liked angela lansbury in a favorite movie of mine, "long hot summer," and while not a huge fan of the show, enjoyed "murder, she wrote." but here -- i not only didn't care for the story or other aspects, but i found angela's squealing, squawking, singing, and everything else about her over-the-top performance, perhaps the most annoying presence in any movie (or presentation in any other media) i've ever experienced. it was like an unending continuation of audrey hepburn's equally "over-the top" cockney chortling at rex harrison - in the earlier portions of "my fair lady." but that was incident to the plot, presented for light, comedic effect, and (mercifully) brief. unmercifully, this was anything but brief, and to me seemed as if it had gone-on for about 10 hours (einstein's layman's explanation of "relativity" at work.) if i hadn't been with friends, with the necessity to remain, my viewing would have been brief. i laughed, though, at the "seinfeld" episode where elaine pisses everyone off because she tells them how much she disliked "the english patient." my friends somewhat regarded me the same way when i interrupted their waxing ecstatically over this movie. give me some dragging fingernails loudly over a chalk board anytime instead.

some aspects of this production are good, such as the performances of angela lansbury, george hearn, cris groenendaal, and sal mistretta. but am i the only one who is distracted by the horrible performance by betsy joslyn as johanna? she is terrible! she slauters the songs with her screechy voice and overacts in a role she clearly doesn't understand. i also think the chorus isn't up to snuff. they drag the tempo and make the worst facial expressions. overall, i think this production is okay, but sweeney todd can be so much more if done correctly. this production doesn't come near the level this material demands. the concert version with george hearn and patti lupone is much better.

i finally got hold of a dvd copy of this production and was agog with curiosity, since i had read so many people praising it to the skies, particularly angela lansbury's portrayal of mrs. lovett. i saw the tim burton movie a few months ago and thought it over the top and overly bloody; thankfully this version is not so horrifying gory but it suffers dramatically in too many other ways for it to be in the least satisfying to me.to begin with, the casting. george hearn is adequate and at least shows some expression (as opposed to johnny depp's unending wooden face in the movie). angela lansbury is, quite simply, annoying. at least she has enough power in her voice to get the point across as opposed to helena bonham carter's piping and expressionless little girl's voice, but subtlety seems to be only a word in the dictionary to ms. lansbury. one cannot be drawn into the story when one of the main characters spends her entire time mugging and winking in a "look, ma, i'm acting!" fashion and being far too aware of the audience. this is not something that is typical of stage productions, heaven knows--i have been a regular attendee of many productions at the stratford festial for many years and stage actors do not behave in that fashion as a rule (at least those who want to continue to find regular employment do not!)...betsy joslyn. oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. did anybody besides me notice that she can't sing this role even vaguely appropriately? and her playing george hearn's daughter is just creepy, considering that she was married to him at the time. isn't she supposed to be a sweet little sixteen-year-old? yes, i realize that this is what acting is all about, but not once did she convince me that she was any younger than about thirty-five, and the phrase "mutton dressed as lamb" seems to have been coined just for her. her butchering of "green finch and linnet bird" had me gnashing my teeth and ready to turn off the dvd player at once. that song was done so well in tim burton's movie, and this was a sad shock. the song requires the vocal range of julie andrews in the 1960's and a purity of voice that is only comparable to that of a boy soprano. any vibrato at all kills it dead, and ms. joslyn spent the entire time warbling so hard that i thought she was about to fall off of her ladder because she was trembling so much from the effort at sustaining coloratura notes with a voice that is a mezzo at best. let us pass over the spectacle of her vibrating at least a quarter tone flat on at least three of the higher notes... this is quite simply not a coloratura role and perhaps a discerning director should have told her that--but the fact that she was married to the star might possibly have tied the director's hands.cris groenendaal was adequate, but again obviously far too old for the role and there is zero chemistry between him and ms. joslyn, which makes the whole subplot fall completely flat. i am reminded a little of past stage productions of wagner's ring cycle where, due to the vocal power required for the singers to bellow over the sound of a full wagnerian orchestra they would have to cast based upon ability to penetrate vocally as opposed to any appearance or acting ability or even a good voice, which is why you have the caricature of the massive mountainous viking-horned brunehilde with a triple chin and a beard, when the libretto calls for an ethereal beauty who is eternally young and bewitching. the casting of the "juvenile" leads is exactly like that--if you close your eyes you can almost believe in mr. groenendaal's anthony, but as soon as you look at the screen the illusion is shattered. (and at no time can you ever believe in ms. joslyn's johanna...) for me, the rest of the production was completely lost because of three out of the four major characters were so obviously miscast. i cannot give a proper review of anything else because they were so distracting that they spoiled the rest of the production. i really can't understand why people rave about this badly-shot and self-conscious filming of a stage play. surely there's more to camera work in the theatre than just plunking a camera down in the front row? if i want that, i'll go to a decent play, preferably at the stratford festival, where at least they work together for the production and aren't constantly mugging for the camera. i give it three stars only because the quality of the production apart from the antics of lansbury and joslyn seems adequate if not spectacular.probably the best thing one can do is buy the soundtrack of the film and a cast recording of this play, and then combine the two to make a bearable whole. that's what i'm going to do, and try to forget that i ever bothered to rent this wholly unremarkable production.

"ordinary decent criminal" is sad because it is obviously trying to succeed and equally obviously hasn't a chance in hell of making it apparently owing to the absence of a clear sense of purpose. a abysmal failure at droll irish comedy with spacey as a thief who enjoys outsmarting the cops and his competition becoming a sort of folk hero in his own mind, this flick manages to be mildly amusing when it's trying to be funny, slightly more than boring when it's trying to be interesting, and forget sentimental or poignant or endearing though it takes shots at those qualities as well. "ordinary decent criminal" has a clumsy screenplay, naive direction, journeyman execution, thin story, poor casting, mediocre acting, and eventually becomes lost in itself and sinks into a mire of hopeless mediocrity. pass on this one. (d)

this film is really quite odd. clearly certain *events* portrayed identify the main protagonist as the dublin criminal known as "the general" but almost everything else is just wrong. we are not talking of a distortion of ancient history...but a complete distortion of irrefutable, documented facts. the question indeed is why? the garda are shown as latter day keystone cops, his gang as non-menacing, and the man himself as..well kevin spacey. almost pure fiction anyway, why bother to try to give a semblance of realism? having said all that, it is a poor exercise *any* way you want to look at it. not worth a second of anyone's time.

i was really looking forward to watching this film. it had all the ingredients of a great tongue in cheeker, but it just didn't come together at all. kevin spacey's accent was tolerable except that sometimes he forgot to use it and i would rather not have had to listen to linda fiorentino's pale attempt. she and helen baxendale were totally lacking in charm and personality, thankfully their screen kids had loads, so you could find at least some members of his 2 families endearing. you could have strained spaghetti with the plot and i'm sure that the script was written by some adolescent schoolboy in a high school english competition. that said, when i wasn't cringing, i was smirking so it wasn't a totally wasted 90 minutes. i did find the superimposing of kevin's face on the painting very clever and quite funny. maybe i'm being a bit harsh but i was expecting a bit of quality viewing and it just never came.

one of the worst excuses for an irish accents i've heard. from a truly great actor too. its a bad irish accent not to mention a dublin accent (which is completely different) anyway the film is loosely based around the story of ganglord martin cahill and its done much much much better with brendan gleeson in the title role in the general

"ordinary decent criminal" is sort of based on the exploits of martin cahill, already the subject of john boorman's 1998 film "the general". cahill had a rough upbringing in a slum area and graduated from petty crime to armed robbery with honours. he justified his criminal career by pointing out his poor background at every opportunity. this is a common excuse for criminals that conveniently overlooks the thousands of slum-dwellers who don't turn to robbing post offices and selling guns in order to make ends meet. cahill made fools of the police and local authorities, not to mention the ira, which earned him a sort of "folk hero" status as well as making him many enemies. however, he was basically an amoral, self-serving thief.my primary problem with "odc" is that the protagonist is made out to be a lovable irish rogue. kevin spacey does a good job portraying michael lynch with a blend of oily charm and quiet menace, but the character is too amoral and selfish to be seen as any sort of hero, even an anti-hero. the film is well shot and well acted by a fine cast, but what lets it down is the script. writer gerard stembridge can't make up his mind; is he writing an irish "lock stock" or a grittier treatment of martin cahill's thieving career? that's the problem when a writer bases his central character on a real person. it's also unfortunate that "odc" followed the cinema release of john boorman's "the general", which was a more accurate portrayal of martin cahill's story. cahill was a cunning thief who knew the value of good publicity, so it's not surprising that his exploits got the movie treatment.what is surprising is that a studio was prepared to take cahill's story and give it a happy hollywood-style ending. kevin spacey's charismatic-twinkly-bigamist-thief michael lynch gets to ride off into anonymity on his motorcycle in "odc". in the real world, martin cahill was executed by the ira, just to prove that no-one makes fools of an out-dated, sectarian and corrupt para-military organisation and gets away with it. the real cahill would never have walked away from his notoriety because it bolstered his "man of the people" self-image. having michael lynch give up everything to avoid death in "odc" is a cop-out ending to a weak and shallow movie.

this movie moved much too slowly for my taste.the concept of the story is refreshingly different in that it explores the family dynamics of living with a mentally-retarded family member in a way that i have not previously seen on-screen.however,the execution of the concept was flawed.each character was developed fully within the scene of her first appearance,then one had to endure the feeling that each character was treading water the rest of the way.that is,each character flailed about awkwardly in her interpersonal relationships with others in the movie,which i found to be a form of emotional and social retardation.i suppose this has artistic merit,given the irony that the story centers around an intellectually retarded individual surrounded by way above-average intelligence friends and family.the acting,however,was well-done without exception.i agree with other reviewers that the cinematography was beautiful.in summary,i think the film has strong artistic merit because of the fine acting and cinematography,but fails on an emotional level due to the shortcomings described.

after the general, a film that romanticized the life of dublin gangster the general to such heroic proportions that it made the average dublin person sick, along come kevin and his attempted portrayal of mr. lynch or martin cahill, aka the general, the acting is so bad that this crime drama becomes a comedy for the native dub, and a tragedy for the kevin spacey fan. in short, is the movie worth a look.... no, unless u like bad acting with hilarious 'proper irish accents, ah sure to be sure to be sure'. the story is ripped off from the commercially successful 'the general' which, despite is glorification of a well known dublin animal in martin cahill is still worth a look, on a domestic scale because it shows real working class dublin, and on an international scale because of he true irish acting and killer cast, including john voight. all in all, 'ordinary decent criminal' is anything but a decent film. avoid.

well,first of all, as many reviewers have pointed out - this is a rip off of the martin cahill story - first represented by the bbc and by the john boorman film "the general" - which is a great film and far, far superior to this one.speaking as a native british person, the supporting cast to kevin spacey was really good in terms of british and irish acting talent, especially peter mullan - but it was totally wasted. the characters were c**p! and as for kevin spacey - didn't come across as a loveable rogue but as nothing really substantial or significant.not a lot to redeem this film. the best bits are the gags and tricks nicked from the other films it rips off. compare notes on this film and "the general" - i'd be interested to see what others think.

kevin spacey is my favorite actor of all time, he is without a doubt on other's lists as well when it comes to great actors. he even pulled off a good irish accent in ordinary decent criminal as well. but kevin spacey, as a mafia leader? or even a burglar? i'm not so sure he could go that far. the movie to me just didn't make any sense and the some of the story just didn't feel solved to me.i know once again that imdb is going to make me write ten more lines. but i'm not so sure on what i could say about this movie because i am still trying to figure it out. silly, isn't it? but i'm pretty sure that more than a few of you imdb users have been in the same predicament as i am in right now where you just want to say a line or two about a movie, but now you have to do ten lines? wow, that should do it. :d 3/10

kevin spacey is without a doubt one of the best actors of the 90s. after his performances in the usual suspect, se7en and american beauty, you expect more and more from him. that is why ordinary decent criminal is a huge disappointment.michael lynch is the most artful criminal in dublin who is never in a bad mood. his next heist becomes an obsession when his partners start questioning michael's ability to plan everything perfectly, although this is the only thing he does when he isn't playing good father at home.i guess, it's partly my fault for not paying enough attention to the thousand plot details which sadly turn out to be the "essence" of the film. i gave the movie a chance by calling it a parody and.... well, parodies are always funny, no matter what they spoof or how they do it. so, it wasn't after all a complete parody on purpose. it's just a different con movie that desperately tries to be funny and fails.unlike some of his "colleagues", ordinary decent criminal depends too much on story development and logical continuity, forgetting what's the main reason, the viewer has picked this kind of movie - to be entertained. this is definitely not entertainment. it includes one of the most ridiculous scenes ever - the introduction of michael's two wives. i don't know whether it's some kind of a mindless metaphor or strange, dark humor, but the chicks are sisters. remember, spacey's character has kids.ordinary decent criminal is complex and confusing. you are not waiting for a funny scene. instead, you carefully follow the dialog, because there is a big possibility of losing yourself into the boring, pale universe, the film has inhabited.let's go back to spacey. i wonder in what condition he has been, signing for that movie. it's not miscasting, but something much worse. an insult to his work in american beauty, released an year before ordinary decent criminal. the character michael is eccentric and talkative. spacey is almost pathetic at times. the only cure for this, is thinking of lester burnham and roger kint.writer, gerrard stembridge should definitely re-consider his screen writing abilities and be more objective this time. because, the dialog is very weak and the scenes are often pointless. and we are still talking about a comedy.ordinary decent criminal is a really bad crime comedy which does not deserve your attention.

an oirish film not made for an irish audience. with fiorentino, baxendale and spacey each incapabable of a half decent oirish accents the powers-that-be had but one choice - force the irish actors to adopt equally bad oirish accents, reducing the whole thing to the lowest common denominator.

i wasted 35 minutes of my life on this turkey before i gave up. the main character is completely clueless and astoundingly unsympathetic, but there is no humor in his blundering. as soon as he arrives in germany, the screenwriter pulls the old "there's only one room in the hotel, you'll have to share a room with a pretty girl" stunt. come on, at least you could let them develop their relationship a bit first. watch "it happened one night" to see how to do it right--or any of a thousand movies since then.the acting is consistently third-rate, and the improvised dialogue should have been left on the cutting-room floor. it meanders with no plan at all, despite the fact that the film telegraphs the relationship's destination from the moment greta is introduced.the first song, in the boardroom, is mildly funny but badly sung. the rest of the songs (well, to be fair, i only heard those in the first half-hour) are just pointless and awful. most of the singers are painfully out of tune, but not in any intentionally humorous sort of way.

simply awful. i'm including a spoiler warning here only because of including a coupla jokes from the movie - there is nothing else to spoil, as it is already rotten. this dross was made during what must have been one of sellers' "for a few dollars more" periods, when he'd participate in any crap for a few bucks. i'd seen this as a 15-year- old high school student in 1972, and loathed it then. no need to view it again; after 35 years i remember it now as one of the top five worst movies i'd seen as a kid. as i recall, sellers had more of an ongoing cameo role than a lead here, but even his presence couldn't ameliorate the stale jokes, lame plot, and infantile repartee. one ongoing theme revolves around sellers' use of his fingers: in one scene, he holds up his open hand to a group of medicos, and by folding down his fingers, enumerates the groups for which a hospital exists - the interns, the nurses, the administrators, etc. - until only his middle finger is left up, whereupon he says "...and the patients!" har har. in another scene, to avoid costly lab tests, he dips a finger into a urine sample and sticks it into his mouth to check for sugar, then exhorts the interns gathered around him to do the same, which they do. he then advises them that he'd placed his middle finger in the urine, but sucked on the index finger, and admonishes them to pay attention. hee hee. (the only reason that i remember this, and this movie, and am writing this review, is that a friend told me an even dumber version of this 'joke' today). if yu laik thiss, you gonna luv dis movey. if not, see 'hospital', with george c. scott (came out the same year, 1972) for some genuine, marvelous black medical humor. better yet, read 'the house of god', by samuel shem, and if you can, see the movie version of it, which has never been released (please make a copy and send it to me - i'd love to finally see it).

two things are always signs that you`re going to be watching a bad movie :1 ) if you`re instantly reminded of other movies like the terminator, hardware or blade runner during the title sequence 2 ) if there`s a death during a sex scene straight after the title sequencethere`s actually a third warning sign and that`s a caption indicating lazy exposition warning the poor ignorant naive audience of the dangers of corporate greed . guess what ? cyborg 2 starts with a caption warning us of corporate greed in the future , followed by a title sequence that reminded me of the terminator , hardware and blade runner followed by a death during a sex scene ! hey you don`t suppose i`ll be watching a bad movie by any chance ? as you can guess this is a bad movie . it`s basically a series of action scenes written around a thread bare plot of a cyborg on the run from a greedy corporate company . it`s badly written , directed and acted and most especially it`s badly lit which means it`s very difficult to see what`s happening on screen , though i`m not entirely sure this is actually a bad thing . the only interest to be had is that it`s the film debut of angelina jolie who plays the cyborg on the run and who says the prophetic line " they`re lovely , i wonder if they`re real ? " which is something i ask myself whenever i see one of her movies

cybrog 2:glass shadow stars elias koteas as colton hicks (rhymes with kicks!) a karate instructor who helps a cash (jolie) escape from pinwheel, her creators who look to detonate her and destroy a rival company. along the way billy drago and karen shepherd show up to displace the duo, while jack palance is there to deliver guidance to the duo on the run. one of the things that is quite shocking about the cyborg franchise, is how the series has managed to have quite prolific and off beat actors in the cast. the original had jean-claude van damme and dayle haddon (don't know her? well she was in a bunch of 70's pornos) this one has jack palance, elias koteas,billy drago and angelina jolie. the third one has william katt, zach galligan and malcom mcdowell. (okay so, cyborg 3's cast isn't that impressive.) i've never seen cyborg 3, but i did see this on sci-fi channel and must admit i wasn't impressed. actually strike that, cyborg 2 is an often lovely looking movie, it's shot with excellent style and the visual detail make this easy on the eye. however cyborg 1 was the same way, indeed the movie was directed with a certain amount of style, slow motion and music that made it all easy on the eye. unfortunately like the first, this one doesn't have any new ideas or anything resembling a plot or texture. most of the ideas are taken from blade runner and max headroom, so for various reasons the movie doesn't have much to offer beyond it's look. another aspect is the terrible acting. karen shepherd and billy drago are absolutely terrible and angelina jolie isn't much better. elias koteas and jack palance come off fine but seriously palance is playing a cyborg warrior and koteas is a karate instructor. i guess on the positive side you can't accuse michael schroeder of not being ambitious with casting. still the movie is dull and i for one lost interest in the story fifteen minutes in. also why did they tie it in with cyborg anyway? it has nothing to do with it's predecessor, which this manages to be worse than.* out of 4-(bad)

this movie is a cyborg in and of itself: half nonsense/half lifetime original movie.as a cyborg, this movie has but one objective: to make you wish that you had spent the duration of the film in a dark room punching yourself in the testicles.unlike many people, i did not rent this movie because of angelina jolie(i'll explain why i rented it shortly). i am not a big fan of ms. jolie's, though i will say that her performance was stellar! her blank stare and robotic acting really did have me believing that she was an android hooker. if anyone has a clip of her on 'inside the actor's studio' explaining how she prepared for this role, please send it my way. i'll make sure to use it when i try james lipton for crimes against integrity.so what drove me to rent this movie? one would think that it was the hope of seeing angelina jolie's nipples, but it wasn't. no, the reason behind this rental rested solely on one of the images on the cover of the dvd; that of jack palance's face! half of his face was robotic! when i saw that, i imagined legions of "palances" slowly marching through a fiery wasteland, laying waste to any humans that were foolish enough to resist. in my mind's eye, every member of this unholy army of palances had a red, glowing eye; a red, glowing eye that looked at humans and saw only "meat". they were to be the architects of oblivion...a cold, steely apocalypse...a nightmare from which humanity would never awaken. it's a beautiful image that i will cherish till the end of my years.like most things in my life, the actual movie did not live up to my expectations. no, there was only 'one' jack palance, and the only visible cybernetic enhancements that he had were located on his legs. sadly, those enhancements didn't really "enhance" anything. that is unless, you count walking like a polio victim as a super power. at least their was a scene where jack--grinning like a trigger-happy alzheimer's patient--got to shoot the hell out of some people. i was waiting for him to yell, "i'm damn tired of paying too much for prescription medication!" unfortunately, any outbursts of geriatric rage were few and far between.what the movie did have an abundance of was a poorly developed love story about a man(elias koteas, a.k.a. poor man's de niro) and a cyborg(angelina jolie, a.k.a. demon spawn of john voigt). oh man, can the love between a romeo of flesh and a juliet of silicon ever be able to last?!?!?! it can if you follow jack palance's simple advice: "you have to taste each other's time".yeah, i'm not sure what that means. however, i am sure that i do not want jack palance to be the one to explain it to me. i sure as heck don't want him to show me! as an experiment, i suggest that you ask your significant other if he/she "thinks that we have reached a level in our relationship where we can begin to taste each other's time?"

as a sci-fi and casual angelina jolie fan, i thought this obviously low-budget movie might be worth a look... maybe it had a few scenes or a storyline that would make up for all its other faults. plus, it might be interesting to watch angelina as she was embarking on her star-bound career.oh how wrong i was. one thing i learned -- at 18, angelina jolie couldn't act. so, to make her comfortable, the producers cast this entire movie with people who couldn't act. seeing this, jack palance (who can actually act) decided to overact. watching 10 minutes of this happen is enough to burn your eyes out.to the horrible acting and overacting add a nonsensical script, insipid dialog, bottom-of-the-barrel cinematography... in fact add bottom-of-the-barrel everything.the story features angelina as a cyborg programmed by her corporate overlords as an assassin. she escapes the corporate hq with the help of her combat instructor. the corporation sends bounty hunters after them. stupid stuff happens. the end. i would tell you more but i didn't want to waste my life watching this dreck.i implore you -- this is not worth watching. its not even worth thinking about watching. save yourself the pain and move on.

it's a kinder, gentler cyborg movie with a love story. awww. it's not as bad as it sounds. the action, when it is there, is decent and jack palance, elias koteas, and angelina jolie are always dependable. it's the fact that this is a sequel to the terrible jean claude van damme film, or is that the capper to the masters of the universe trilogy? i'm still confused about that. either way, there was really no need for this movie. what was there a need for? angelina jolie. she may play an assassin robot that can explodes mid-coitus, but, what a way to go and even though this is her first movie, she still has the presence that made her an award winner.

i kind of had somewhat high expectations for this movie. i've always thought that tom selleck's lesser known movies (ie runaway and coma), where well above the ones he had more press for. maybe the producers should have had a little more knowledge about former major league baseball players who became stars overseas. the majority were players too good for triple a baseball, but not exactly major league matériel. i admire the idea of putting selle's's character in japn, versus the cliché of having play in the minors. sad to say, this movie, much like the title of the post, is stranded at third by a movie that seems to be running on autopilot. i wouldn't mind seeing a sequel, and hopefully, the producers would learn from the mistakes. the premise is just way too unique to be left alone with this uneven flick

this movie stinks majorly. the only reason i gave it a 3 was because the graphics were semi charming. it's total disregard for a plot and the lack of even insubstantial surface character development made it seem like just a bunch of nice drawings. this is by far the worse anime that came out of japan. i can't believe they actually put their names on this garbage. what a rip off selling this thing for $20. if you haven't seen this don't bother. if you have, i pity you.

i'd have to agree with the previous reviewer: this film has awesome animation, but has problems throughout the rest of the movie.plot holes are huge, dialog barely explains the concepts of the plot--the main plot points aren't even fully explained until the last five minutes of the film. the characters state the obvious, while failing to explain the more confusing points of the film. there are characters that pop up and have importance in the storyline that are never explained--most of them have names that are only mentioned *once*, and it is exceedingly confusing to a viewer.don't waste your time with this movie. unless you are in it for a good laugh and how dumb it is.

i realize it's a small statistical sampling (8 votes as of this posting), but 5.9 out of 10? i'm giving this movie a 3 and even that's generous. i've tried to watch this movie three times now (the saturday night 9 p.m. premiere on scifi channel, and the saturday night at 1 a.m. and thursday night re-broadcasts) and i've fallen asleep all three times before the movie ends. which leaves me with a laundry list of unanswered questions. for example, is lance henriksen that strapped for cash that he has to keep playing supporting roles in these god-awful "pumpkinhead" sequels? is henriksen contractually banned from doing any non-"pumpkinhead" movies? can't the creators of this franchise do better than a monster that looks like a geriatric, emaciated "alien" who walks like he has a stick jammed up his a**? when are the hick characters in these movies going to realize that handguns and rifles don't hurt the "pumpkinhead?" why don't they try jamming another stick up this thing's a** instead? and, lastly, are the writers of this movie so creatively challenged that they couldn't come up with names for the two feuding families more original than the hatfields and the mccoys? while you're at it, why not write a screenplay about a fictional president and name him george bush? someday i may have the mental stamina to watch this movie all the way through without drifting off to sleep. until then, if somebody has the answers, please let me know.

writer/director michael hurst's sci-fi channel sequel to stan winston's classic horror tale of revenge gone awry has its moments and some decent gore, but ultimately falls short in comparison to the original.i'm pretty sure the filmmakers weren't trying to make a comedy, but i caught myself laughing throughout. a family feud started over a car accident is the basis for this entry into the franchise. the hatfield and mccoy families live in a backwoods town with dirt roads, drive pickup trucks, drink moonshine, and kick each others asses every chance they get. just when they thought it was safe to hate each other and live happily ever after, jodie hatfield (amy manson) and ricky mccoy (bradley taylor) decided to fall in love causing the fit to hit the shan. one night the two lovebirds decide to head out into the woods for some quality time while ricky's sister plays lookout, but it just so happens that on that very night some of the hatfields accidentally kill ricky's sister and catch him and jodie together. you know what happens next. ricky finds his sisters body and decides to pay a visit to haggis so that he can exact his revenge through the mighty pumpkinhead. ye haw! also, harley (lance henriksen) is back to warn potential damned souls against using pumpkinhead to ease their pain. which really put a kink in the story because harley is supposed to have called on pumpkinhead years before this story takes place, but the setting and characters look like dirty pilgrims that somehow traveled through time in order to bring the pickup truck back to plymouth. then there's the sheriff (rob freeman) who has his own ties to the demon and looks like he belongs in a 70's revenge movie instead of a made-for-cable horror flick.some of the gore and special effects were cool, but instead of sticking to the man-in-a-suit way of thinking hurst used some terrible looking 3d shots for certain scenes. one particularly embarrassing shot shows pumpkinhead jumping from tree branches like a badly rendered 3d monkey. the cinematography was exceptional and elevated the quality of the movie quite a bit. the acting was pretty decent also, with the exception of a few poorly executed accents.family feuds never end well, especially when the families involved in the feud have to deal with pumpkinhead. i didn't enjoy every minute of this flick, but it was much better than most of the movies the sci-fi channel spits out. maybe it's a sign that the channel is trying to bring the quality of its movies up to match the quality of its original series'. i wouldn't waste any coin on a rental, but if you get the chance to catch a rerun of it on the boob-tube i would say to check it out. it's a not-so-killer-film but it rises slightly above the level of trash that makes it onto dvd these days.

well they've done it again a new pumpkin head film, the first pumpkin head film was perfect for its time, a dumb, gory, and clichéd monster flick. so heres how it goes, some one loses their loved one, goes to the witch in the woods, gets her to raise pumpkin head and have it murder everyone responsible. unfortunately the film makers have deemed it irrelevant to try and do any other than this, for the films fourth outing, deeming it far more suitable to add some lame romeo and juliet sub plot, involving an idiotic family feud (over a car!!!!) and surprise surprise some gory pumpkin head slayings, so far so formulaic, but it doesn't stop there the acting talent in this flick is dire...oh so bad half of them can't even keep up a southern accent without slipping into their native and often posher accents. lance henrikssen is on board so surely he would bring some gravitas to the movies proceedings...but no lance merely ambles on screen lets the words fall out mouth with absolutely no emotion or seemingly direction, and walks off again, i honestly think he just turned up for the money, then went off to his trailer to drunk and reminisce about aliens.this film is utter cack there is no redeeming feature other than it ending credits which signal its all over.despite the failings of ph:bf...if you want a no brainer that'll make you laugh for all the wrong reasons watch it.if you want something with abit more meat and originality avoid.

pumpkinhead was in itself a decent 80s horror flick. no classic by any means, but an enjoyable piece of fluff. why then, have we now been treated to a fourth film in this franchise is beyond me. as in previous sequels, there's nothing here to really connect the films except for the monster, the witch and ed harley (lance henriksen). this time out we follow the feud between the hatfields and the mccoys. part of the film is a romeo and juliet romance as a young mccoy boy and his hatfield lover decide to run away to be together. soon, however, they are torn apart and the boy's sister is killed. the boy escapes to the woods and gets the witch to resurrect pumpkinhead for some vengeance. the acting is passable at best, amateurish at the worst. the titular demon doesn't even really show up for almost forty minutes and when it does its a pale comparison between it and the original design. overall, blood feud fails to impress. it may be worth a watch once, but certainly not an addition to the collection.

academy awarding actor sidney poitier of "lilies of the field" reprises his role as lieutenant virgil tibbs from the 1967 oscar winning best picture "in the heat of the night" for veteran director gordon douglas' tired, uninspired sequel "they call me mister tibbs," with nobody the equivalent of rod steiger with which to swap dialogue. clearly, both "bullitt" scenarist alan r. trustman and robert d. webb of "cape fear" were off their game when they penned this predictable police procedural potboiler. the dialogue is drab and none of the characters are interesting, not even the chief suspect. absolutely nothing remotely exciting, suspenseful, or surprising occurs in this tame whodunit. meanwhile, things have changed considerably since virgil was last seen in "in the heat of the night." he worked as a homicide detective for the philadelphia, pennsylvania, police department. in "they call me mister tibbs," our hero works for the san francisco police department. moreover, he has a wife, valerie (barbara mcnair of "change of habit"), and a family, a young rebellious son, andy (george spell of "the naked kiss"), and a younger doting daughter, ginger (wanda spell of "hickey and boggs"). tibbs drives a medium blue mustang and his wife holds down the house and hovers over their two children since he doesn't have as much time to spend with them. literally, there are no surprises in this pedestrian murder mystery. indeed, the best thing about "they call me mister tibbs" is quincy jones' terrific orchestral soundtrack with a memorable opening theme, more memorable than this forgettable crime thriller deserved.everything begins sensationally enough with a struggling prostitute, joy sturges (linda towne of "the adventurers"), being bludgeoned to death in the bedroom of her downtown apartment by an unseen assailant. apartment handyman mealie williamson (juano hernandez of "intruder in the dust") enters joy's apartment and finds her strewn on the carpet dead with a bloody forehead. he picks up the statue briefly and then puts it back on the floor and reports joy's death to the superintendent of the apartment, rice weedon (anthony zerbe of "license to kill"), and weedon gives mealie and fistful of dollars and sends him packing. afterward, weedon anonymously notifies the sfpd that popular minister logan sharpe (martin landau of "nevada smith") beaten joy to death and was seem leaving joy's apartment. captain marden (jeff corey of "true grit") assigns tibbs to handle the case; it seems that both tibbs and sharpe have known each other for 18 years. naturally, tibbs' wife valerie cannot believe that the well-known, politically active evangelist could have committed such a crime. just to give the movie context, it should be noted that when tibbs and the police study the crime scene, they mention the word 'semen,' no doubt a controversial term to mention in an early 1970s movie.tibbs questions weedon whom he suspects is either a drug pusher or a pimp. weedon explains that he has no records on joy sturges because she was subletting the apartment from another realty company. tibbs visits the realty company and realtor woody garfield (ed anser of "jfk") flees and drives off, essentially doing an o.j. simpson until he crashes his car after a lengthy but tame pursuit. when tibbs proves that woody didn't kill joy, he allows him to leave, with his disgruntled wife, marge (norma crane of "penelope"), prepared to file for divorce after the revelation that he paid a hooker to stay in an apartment.tibbs tracks down handyman mealie and clears him of the crime, and then he goes after weedon. luckily, for tibbs, our hero catches the evil weedon in the middle of a narcotics transaction. one of weedon's henchmen assaults tibbs, but tibbs dispenses with him briefly before he embarks on a long foot chase after weedon. eventually, he corners weedon in an underground parking garage and they shoot it out. guess who wins.the scenes in the tibbs' household are more interesting than his investigation. andy runs rampant, striking his sister, and smoking in the garden. our hero wants him to clean up his room. when andy refuses, tibbs pops him three times on the jaw. these child rearing scenes could probably never be handled today as they were back in 1970. at the end of the movie, as if to solidify the family sequence, tibbs is seen walking off with his wife and kids. there is on confrontation between valerie and virgil about the welfare of their children and how his long hours at work has affected them.director gordon douglas directs in competent fashion. surprisingly, for a film released in 1970, the filmmakers never play the race card. in one scene, when tibbs searches a billiards parlor owned by an african-american, we see a mixed breed of races scowling at the hero when he finds mealie and leaves with him in tow.altogether, "they call me mister tibbs" is a poor follow-up to "in the heat of the night." mind you, poitier delivers another fine performance with nuance, but everything looks prefabricated. all of the sets look fake and there isn't much physical violence: one underground parking lot shoot-out that doesn't last long and a fight. beyond jones' seminal jazz score, the only surpriseand it really doesn't qualify as a major surprise more like a convenient contrivanceis the ending. donald medford's "the organization" followed "they call me mister tibbs" as the second, more action-packed sequel.

this sequel to "in the heat of the night" will suffer in inevitable comparisons to its infinitely better predecessor. instead of looking like a theatrical movie edited for television, "mister tibbs" looks suspiciously like a tv movie edited for theatrical release, with grainy photography, cheesy opening titles, and sets that look like they're made of plywood. the murder sequence has a glaring continuity error: the camera shows two hands choking the girl, then a shot of a hand reaching for a statuette, then a shot of the girl being choked with two hands again, and finally the statuette coming down for the fatal blow. solving the case should be easy: find the only guy with three hands! but the shoddy production values can't completely obscure this film's considerable merits: namely, sidney poitier's performance as the cool detective determined to follow the evidence wherever it may lead, even if it implicates a friend. martin landau is also convincing as the do-gooder preacher-activist suspected of brutally murdering his prostitute girlfriend. in addition to being haunted by the case, tibbs is conflicted about his home life, but the issues of race and tibbs' barely concealed sense of social outrage are absent here. so is the complex murder mystery that made "in the heat of the night" so compelling.

give h.g. lewis points: he managed to incorporate beefy exotic dancers, gallons of his notorious fake blood, and henny youngman all in one movie. "the gore gore girls" was lewis's horror film swan song, and ends with a head being squashed by an automobile. oh... henny plays a surly night club owner whose girls are falling prey to lewis's standard butchery.

top gun without the in-house animosity. or class. or money. or cruise. an excuse for an upwardly mobile cast of next-big-thing actors to market their ability to lead a matinée this doesn't really have anything anyone can get their teeth into. it's a shame because the opening shot of charlie sheen opens out with great promise which is squandered almost straight away with a preposterous wedding set piece. barking.dennis haysbert is a changeable actor for me but in this film he is fine, particularly the action sequences. michael biehn is a first-class action hero but not a leading man: charlie sheen is, to all intents and purposes, the leading man but never quite an action hero. there's a stunt cast of hundreds who are also mentionworthy. 3/10

the contemporary chapter of the u.s. navy's elite underwater demolition team is called to do.... whatever they want, apparently.charlie sheen was made an officer. already the storyline is unbelievable. michael biehn is his immediate c.o., but he keeps charlie on a rather long leash and one of the guys pays for it early on by getting killed thanks to charlie's patented stupidity. the rest of the team spends their spare time committing courts-martial offenses. mostly an exercise in random gunfire and paper-thin ethics, these particular seals might be better suited to serving as crash-test dummies.some good action scenes counter the goofy proceedings.

someone commented that charlie sheen's character should be court martialed for doing whatever he wanted. you may be right, but that is how seal's truly are. i served for several months with a seal team out of norfolk, va. actually, i should say they used our ship to deploy themselves around europe for a couple of months. i was the postal clerk on board and everyday these guys would try to get their mail. since only one person was allowed to pick up the mail each day we issued one pass to one person. each day a different seal would come up pretending to be someone else. well, after the third time i said no to them until i had proof who they were. they went nuts!!! i thought they were gonna bust through my cage, gag me, and then steal the mail. luckily i had not only the president on my side (the navy), but the federal government (us mail). that was the only time i saw the seals stopped from having whatever they wanted. they were allowed unlimited shore leave, where we had to be back on ship at a certain time. they killed and tortured a woman in france and the two seal's only got a 1 week detention on ship, whereas a seamen was caught stealing a bottle of wine from a french wine shop and he got a court martial. is it any wonder why the seal's retention rate is over 85%? as a seal you are god. so this movie does a pretty accurate job of portraying how a seal acts and thinks... unfortunately it is so unbelievable to normal people that it comes off as being fake.

oh, man, i hated this movie. granted, the site locations were great, but that's about the only positive thing i can say about it. now, i'm going to state right at the beginning that i am very critical of the way weapons, especially firearms, are both portrayed, and handled, in movies. being a war flick, portrayal was fine, but the shoddy weapons handling in the movie would have never been tolerated by a real seal team. the acting was more wooden than my first sailboat, the equipment carried (or lack of it) was laughable, and the dialogue was, shall we say, lacking in anything interesting. well, with the exception of the journalist, which was actually prescient. watching this movie was comparable to watching "palmetto" with woody harrelson, where each scene was so bad you just couldn't turn it off, because you had to see if they could get worse with the next scene. like palmetto, they certainly did. the scene in the water, where, after shooting the first of the enemy, they blow the damn boat up, thereby having to face possible drowning, made me laugh so hard, that for a millisecond, i almost thought it was worth waiting through the movie for. then charlie sheen decided to drag the surviving enemy down to the depths of the ocean (the way it was filmed, with the many camera cuts, it looked like they went down about 80 feet. nice continuity there....) before slashing his throat was so damn stupid, i was stunned. then again, so was the whole damn movie. i enjoy action movies, but not this one. note: the version i watched was a tv version, pan & scan. i can't imagine that made a difference, except for making the whole thing blessedly shorter!

i learned little of significance from this film that i did not already know from cnn and the new york times. (and i did not follow the enron case obsessively as did some others.) the film did a very poor job of explaining what "business" enron was in that might actually have been on the up-and-up before it started hiding its debts in the entities created by andy fastow. it also significantly underplayed the role played by arthur andersen and vinson & elkins in validating practices that were afterwards found to be illegal. nor did it go as far as it might have in exploring what the "investors" -- all those prominent bankers -- thought they were doing. with the 24 hour a day cable networks, the discovery channel and the history channel, documentaries have proliferated. i've seen many in the past year that were better than this one.

as a ca resident, i'd like to see the jackholes who were shutting down the electricity plants to raise the prices get some jail time too. i thought the movie was pretty good and has some very informative pieces. while they stuck to how enron rose and crashed, i found it really interesting. however, when the movie focused on it's anti-bush slant, it made me wonder if they were really being accurate. it's fine to point out any connection the republicans had to enron, but the monster was created while clinton was president. the ca energy crisis happened under davis's watch. both were in office during enron's abuses, but neither are held accountable in any way. rather, many minutes are spent on how bush was friends with lay. so what? lay played golf with clinton and spent the night in the lincoln bedroom. why are democrats given such a free pass in this film? i think most politicians are a waste of our taxpayer money so i'm not partial to either party but i hate feeling like i'm subject to someone's political agenda when i watch a documentary. yes, politicians deserve some blame, but i really doubt that the only guilty one's have rs after their names. i found no value in portraying the bush's as kay-lovers when democrats received just as much enron campaign money as republicans did. like i said, it weakens the rest of the film for me because it makes me suspicious of the rest of the facts they lay out.

this movie made my face hurt. i don't understand it...things just happened, inexplicably, and they usually resulted in someone bursting into a song and dance number. i don't understand how people can laud this film with praise. there are b-movies, and then there are b-musicals, and then there is rockula.the songs made me want to run headlong into a wall. the only saving grace is that one of the musical explosions turns out to be a musical video, which eases the pain, yet still fails to justify why it needed to exist. the most frightening section of the film is toni basil's creep-dance that accompanies her weird song. but on the bright side, she can manages to find the notes that she is looking for, unlike pop music sensations rockula (aka rapula) and mona...wow, can we say tone deaf. so if you want to question life for about 90 minutes, see this film. if you hate your life, then buy it.

if you thought herbie trying to kill himself by driving off a bridge in 'the love bug' was daft, wait 'till you see him acting horny in this bewilderingly silly second sequel. dean jones is back as the driver who competes in the paris to monte carlo rally; this time his sentient vw falls in love with another car in the race, a lancia driven by julie sommars. by this point in the series the energy and charm is lacking even more than in 'herbie rides again'; the movie is overlong and threadbare, although it's watchable thanks to the return of jones's typically likable performance, a few funny bits, and the cast's frantic mugging.

even disney are guilty of the cash cow disease, after the roaring success of the love bug in 1968, the house of mouse cashed in with herbie rides again, herbie goes to monte carlo, and herbie goes bananas. neither sequel capturing the charm and inoffensive appeal of the love bug back in 68, in this one we find race driver jim douglas and his sidekick wheely applegate, entering herbie in the monte carlo rally. naturally things outside of the race start to take over priorities, they get mixed up in a diamond robbery and herbie falls in love with another car!. the car stunts are of course pleasant and easy on the eye, and it would be churlish of me to really vent venom on such a friendly piece of fluff, it's just that the film goes nowhere fast and personally now i can see it for the coin motivated piece of work it is. still you get to see herbie take a bath, foil the baddies and of course dance for the lady in his life, so something there for everyone i think....................4/10.

in the last few years of ron miller's (son-in-law of walt disney cum producer) reign he churned out live-action crap on a stick often starring the very boring dean jones, whose entire career was based on that kind of light, empty-headed fare. other horrible films from that same period include pete's dragon, the last flight of noah's ark, unidentified flying oddball and the dreaded condorman. i'll not mention tron because i thought it ambitious and miller was only the executive producer on it, so he had little to do with the actual production. however he was in full force when this god-awful piece of human junk was expelled from the bowels of creativity. herbie goes to monte carlo. second sequel to much- loved love bug tale finds herbie in love with another car who has a brain and heart too. there's a race, some lame bad guys, a diamond and barney fife. shot in france, the film actually is nicely photographed and the countryside is lovely. but one gets the idea the film was made so all involved could have a three month vacation in france. the rest of film is a wreck. prat falls, bumbling thieves, wicked german racing competitors and a pretty bouncing feminist all fall under the category of stock supply. the biggest insult of the film: trying to further develop herbie's lover personality via shakes, beeps, flashing lights and movements indicative of a horny seventeen year old, disney's writers do an injustice to our cute little vw. then again i would think it'd be tough for anyone to top helen hayes driving herbie around a skyscraper ledge in the second outing.

sadly, this movie did have potential with such a willing cast, but everything was so poorly thought out and poorly executed. i don't think i've ever seen any film where every scene just falls flat with a loud thud, as it did here. also, i don't think i've ever seen a "stoner" sex comedy that didn't provide at least one laugh, but this vortex of pain provided nothing but groans and misery. the last time i was this stunned at how un-funny a comedy can be was with the awful "big momma's house." scene after scene, these movies will turn your brain into jelly. silly and stupid can sometimes be funny, but here, silly and stupid are used as a torture device against the viewer. an absolute, rock-bottom dud.

if a movie has an unimaginative, hackneyed story and bland characters it needs to make up for it by being really, really funny. you can get away with a lot if you're funny. but while there are a few amusing moments scattered here and there in grandma's boy, they are so far and few between that they cannot begin to make up for the hack work the film displays in such abundance.the movie certainly doesn't aim to surprise anyone. when alex hides marijuana in his grandma's house in a tea tin you know what's going to happen later on and it does. the movie appears to have been written by a committee who did a study of mediocre comedies and grabbed any gag that appeared in more than one of them.the most interesting thing about the movie is its somewhat unusual setting. the game takes place in a video game development company, which should be an interesting source for some clever comedy. but don't be fooled, this is not a movie about video game developers. this is basically a college frat house movie in which all the frat boys have been shoved into a big room to play video games.the way the movie completely fails to think through its setting and use it for original laughs can be seen in the character of j.p. j.p. is i think more-or-less conspired by the creator of doom, john carmack. at least inspired to the extent that he's an odd genius who makes games.in the movie, j.p. is a weird, obnoxious geek who is despised and jeered by the company game testers. that makes no sense at all. if you are one of the most significant people in the history of video games (as j.p. is supposed to be) then even if you're quirky and obnoxious, people will still admire and respect you on some level. if stephen hawking is obnoxious his associates still aren't going to make jun of him to his face.also, game testers are just as likely to be geeks as j.p., but in the movie they are basically frat boys. it's a fun normal guys against the obnoxious dweebs movie. and while that formula has worked, very occasionally, in the past, it is absurd in the setting of a game company. if you decide to use an unusual setting for a movie, you don't simply cram in all the conventions of movies from different settings into that one. unless you're a hack.about two thirds of the way through the movie i gave up. something happened that i knew would result in a series of painfully predictable events. and i realized i hadn't actually laughed at anything for the last half hour anyway. so i stopped (although i did fast forward just to make sure i was right that they would follow the most predictable clichés, which they did).normally if a movie's bad i just say it's bad and then run out of things to say, but this movie is such a phenomenally shoddy production that it deserves a long diatribe.shame on the movie for luring a good actress like linda cardellini into it, then surrounding her with talentless nobodies. i'll give the movie 1 point for giving shirley jones the chance to be the anti-shirley partridge though.

i can laugh at just about anything, but unfortunately there is not a single one to be found in this stink bomb!!!!i honestly watched this movie from beginning to end, and did not even crack a smile. i am shocked that sandler, schneider, spade etc., would put their names on this piece of crap. worse than the worst that ever came out of the worst that ever came out of former snl players. what more can i say? how could such tasteless, extremely unfunny drivel come from such a pool of apparent talent!! maybe i have lost my sense of humor, (not likely), but i cannot remember a movie that i have disliked this much in a long time. what a waste of 2 hours i will never get back.

i must say i was really excited about this film before renting it as it was an adam sandler "happy madison" production and i am usually attracted to that type of silly humour.there were a few funny moments at the beginning of the film, but this film lacked everything that makes a good movie. i realize that many filmsthat are not realistic can still be quite funny, but this film was unrealistic and not funny at all. the acting was horrible, the cinematography was very poor, the plot made no sense at all. i cannot get over the fact that 3 classy older ladies would even work for such poor writing. overall i was very unimpressed with this film and i do not recommend wasting 5 bucks on renting it.

this movie has no plot. it was supposed to be that a guy moves in with his grandma, and everyone thinks hes a loser and he has to redeem himself. but what happens after everyone finds out who he's living with? they have a big pot party at grandma's house. the climax of the movie didn't even relate to the rest of it. that whole plot was introduced within minutes of the movie's end. i can see how it could have related to the supposed story - that grandma's vg skills redeem him - but that just wasn't there. however, the movie was funny as hell and clearly relied heavily on the jokes. "her pussy smells like the great depression" "he just sucked his first titty...yeah for 13 hours" "it's for you...i think it's the devil"

alright, how someone can actually think this movie is awesome, is so beyond me... i can't even comprehend how someone can find this movie remotely funny, the only character it has going for it, is the evil super nerd game designer, and that gets old after a while. this movie is so predictable, the punchlines are not funny they're forced, you see better acting at the red light district, and the story sucks it's so predictable, you know exactly what's going to happen. even the characters do not react like they should, try going to the hot chick that is your boss at work and telling her that you're banging 2 crazy chicks that you live with at the same time, her response wouldn't be (smile) "ok let's get back to work". i didn't laugh once during this movie, and i wish i had never seen it or spent 3$ to rent it because that's not even worth it. adam sandler produced this movie, i have lost all respect for him. all his movies are the same, his comedy style got old ever since the waterboy came out, if i knew adam sandler had produced this before i rented it...there's no way i would have wasted my time on it. this movie is as bad as it can possibly get from every aspect... ace ventura wasn't a smart comedy movie, it didn't have a killer plot...but it was original and it was hilarious. i'm not knocking the movie because it has 'low-level' humor, i'm knocking it because it sucks, it's a piece of hollywood crap. if this movie was presented to a production company and din't have "adam sandler" behind it, it would be thrown in the garbage quicker than a used condom. if you want a good movie about pot-culture watch cheech and chong, or whitecastle. if you rent this movie all you will get is a generic comedy that targets 14-17 year olds, with loud rock music at every possible cut, acting that will make your eyes squint and your stomach turn, and comedy that is equivalent to watching your stoned friend eating mcdonalds for an hour and a half. don't do it.... for the love of god...this movie sucks, treat it for what it is and look past all the hollywood glory behind it.....hercules in new york used to be the worst movie i had ever seen, but it's actually so bad it's good. this instead was a very expensive movie that sucked just as much, if not more.

first of all, i'd like to say that i really enjoyed this movie. however, that said, i can't say that it was a "good" movie. i went into the theatre with pretty low expectations (something i've learned to do). i'm glad i did, because the plot and development wasn't stellar. the jokes were low-grade humor. but, i was in the right mindset to enjoy them.i wasn't the only one. in fact, the entire theatre was laughing out loud. i didn't hear anyone complain after the movie came to a close. i even saw one guy fall out of his chair laughing! but again, i have to warn you, grandma's boy is not a top-quality film. it is a funny (albeit low-brow) movie, and if you go with the right mindset, you'll really enjoy it. oh, and don't take kids to it.

call me old fashioned, but i like movies with plots. i thought "stoner comedy" was just a way to more specifically describe a comedy in which lots of weed is smoked and the people watching it are more apt to enjoy it high. "grandma's boy," however, has decided this is a full-blown niche and that stoners represent a piece of the comedy pie that need to be reached. apparently, allen covert (star and producer) and the happy madison gang were right, but that doesn't make "grandma's boy" any less boring and unfunny. they might be completely stoned -- but the characters are mostly half-baked.alex (covert, a longtime supporting player for adam sandler, first-time star) is a mid-30s professional video game tester whose roommate has gotten them evicted. he could look for a new apartment, but then we don't have a movie. after trying a couple friends, he ends up living with good ole grandma lilly (doris roberts of "everybody loves raymond"). she wakes him up a 6 am and has him do chores and soon he's falling asleep on the job and so the new video game sequel might not get done on deadline.like most people, alex deals with his frustration and eradicates boredom by either playing video games or getting high or both. his friends/co-workers all do the same thing. most of them are virgins that live at home in addition to loving video games. they're all awkward and all with the exception of nick swardson and joel moore (only at times) their characters aren't funny. funny if you're blazed ... sure, i suppose, but i can't say from experience.maybe all we loser guys like is getting high, playing video games and awkwardly ogling women with specific attention on their breasts, but even so, it shouldn't be the driving force of an entire film. neither should old women getting high on accident (saw that one coming) or being the but of gross-out sex jokes -- but that's what happens when a film isn't about anything. no conflict occurs until the last 20 minutes outside of the slight problems of being out of pot, alex trying to get the hot girl (linda cardellini) to like him and the guys scrambling to finish their levels for the video game deadline.characters can be the saving grace for these meandering stoner flicks, but aside from a lovable doris roberts, the aforementioned swardson as the virgin friend who lives with his parents and calls them his roommates and joel moore's skill at making robot noises, there's little character ingenuity. covert is a run-of-the-mill main character with no comedic dimensions, his dealer friend dante is an inept actor and waste of screen time and jonah hill and kevin nealon are written so far into the periphery it doesn't matter.if you like movies about nothing and watching them in a state of mind and body that enhance that nothingness, "grandma's boy" will likely be just what you're looking for. those who need a little more talent and wit to get on board with a comedy will be left unaffected. the most i can say for "grandma's boy" is that it's watchable despite its pointlessness. it won't feel like a total waste of time but you'll wish you did do drugs so you could at least have made the most of the hour and a half.~steven cvisit my site at www.moviemusereviews.com

there's an underlying current in all the positive reviews of this movie - it's just a brainless comedy, don't take it seriously. chillax dude!!! well that's one point of view. the other would be - why are we accepting exactly the same script, the same formula and the same unfunny people in all these "comedies".what you get is a slacker who, through some totally unreal circumstances, has to change his life (always a he), overcome a set of circumstances which would only pose a problem to a raccoon or a teenager, beat the equally stupid bad guy who is trying to steal the gal he met two days earlier and triumph by remaining a slacker but with more money/self-esteem. on the way somebody does something gross but very illogical. this means you the viewer can call someone after the movie and say something like "you won't believe it maaann. this guy finds the otter drowned in the bucket of diarrhoea the other guy left after he ate laxative brownies. then he shines his shoes with it". hilarious.most of the usual names turn up. david spade and rob schneider do unfunny shtick but they're crrrazzeee characters - a russian and, i'm holding my sides, a waiter in a vegan restaurant. adam sandler, the king of the brainless unfunny, illogical comedy co-produces and some talentless nobody called dante shows up, yet again. the us will have to explain to the rest of the world what this guy dante is famous for cos we are clueless. allen covert plays a 36 year old which got the biggest laugh of the night from me. he was 42 and looked years older.did i laugh? yes, but no more than i would at a tv sit-com and i don't have to pay a penny to watch them. please stop making these movies.

positively ridiculous film.if doris roberts, shirley jones and shirley knight persist in these kinds of films, they can submit their retirement papers and collect social security full-time.while the idea that a 35 year old swinger, who works on video games, loses his apartment and his forced to move in with grandma roberts and borders jones and knight, this is foolishly dealt with. imagine the 3 bags getting high on stuff that grandson alex has left in their home and jones going to bed with someone who may qualify as her grandson!the video game sequences are as foolish as the rest of the film. the assortment of characters that alex works with is beyond belief as he enjoys his weed habit along with the others.terrible best describes this miserable film.

what could be expected from any adam sandler-produced comedy, grandma's boy is predictable and so dumb it is sickening. allen covert stars as alex in the film, a 35 year old pothead who works as a video game tester and has had to move in with his grandma and her two roommates after losing his apartment. some usual plot turns occur: he has trouble adjusting to his new living situation, which in turn makes him have trouble at work, which is particularly bad because he is trying to nail one of the office's new consultants. throw a weird boss, almost alien company star, really nerdy best friend, a few scenes at burnt-out pot dealer's place, a really big party scene, and an original video game alex is trying to finish by himself into the mix you have grandma's boy in its entirety. allen covert does make a marginally good lead, linda cardellini is cute enough for her role as the just-one-of-the-nerds office consultant samantha, and a few scenes do manage to squirt out a chuckle or two but none of that makes grandma's boy worth much of anyone's time. most of the supposed funny "jokes" or "gags" or whatever you want to call them are nothing but "humor" that would make anyone at national lampoons embarrassed to watch, joel moore is incredibly unfunny in his role as video game mastermind j.p., and the entire film actually manages to be boring on top of not funny or substantial. well, at least grandma's boy did something for someone: adam sandler was able to get a few paychecks to his out-of-work friends david spade, kevin nealon, and rob schneider.

honestly, this may be the worst movie i've ever seen. and i've seen spider baby, and not of this earth. heck i've even seen 200 motels. having just discovered the freaks and geeks series and being surprised at the acting ability of linda cardellini i checked out the reviews here and decided this was worth a try. that is the last time i will ever rely on a review at imdb. i didn't realize that morons were writing imdb reviews while they were waiting for their calls to be answered on am radio. this movie is so far beyond bad that mere words cannot express the wretchedness of its vomitous state. seriously. watch this movie if you think will farrel is really really really funny, if you think adam sandler is a comedic genius. watch this movie but please don't breed!

creating a comedy is like walking a pretty thin tight-rope. it either works, or it does not. grandma's boy is one of those movies that does not work. it may have a few very funny parts, but for the majority, it's just a terribly unfunny comedy from the usual supporting characters in adam sandler films (sans sandler himself, he's just a producer).alex (allen covert) is a game tester. he's 35, and is the best tester and game player at his otherwise kid-filled workplace. he ends up getting his apartment and his stuff taken from him for not paying the bills (as it turns out, his roommate had just been spending the rent money on philipino hookers and not paying the landlord). desperate, he moves in with his grandmother, lilly (doris roberts of everybody loves raymond) and her two roommates.that's the basic plot of the film, thrown in with subplots about a hot new girl named samantha (linda cardelli, unrecognizable from her days as velma in scooby doo) trying to get the testers to complete a new game as fast as they can, a robot-like game creating prodigy j.p. (joel moore) who works with alex and wears much of the same clothes as neo in the matrix, and of course, all sorts of sex and drug related jokes. that's it.the problem with the film, besides the fact that the real conflict in the film occurs and is resolved within the last fifteen minutes of the film, is that it just is not funny. it is totally mind-numbingly boring, and only sparingly funny. nothing really happens at all. no emotion, no real sense of direction, and a whole ton of intense swearing. you find yourself maybe laughing at a few funny quips that the actors say, but otherwise sit in complete boredom, wishing you had not even bothered with the film. how this film was greenlit and how fox thought it could make money will always remain a mystery to me.there's just no entertainment value to come from it. none of the actors are actually putting in good performances, they are just acting like idiots for the camera, and hoping for the best. stoner comedy has been done before multiple times, and on occasion, actually works (harold and kumar go to white castle and dazed and confused come to mind). here, it just makes for making the film even less funny than it is already. the random inclusion of a monkey and a pair of bare breasts really does not make the film any better either.other than a few funny one-liners, this movie should just be out-right missed altogether. it's not very funny, the entire plot is silly, it's boring, and it just makes for one horrendous film. avoid it like the plague.1.5/10.

this movie is on the level with "welcome home roxy carmichael" for biggest pieces of garbage that have ever hit the silver screen. if these guys weren't adam sandler's gay friends, this script would have ended up where it should have: as some big time movie exec's toilet paper. i hate this movie, it makes me want to injure people. i will admit that i have high standards, but honestly i'd rather watch step up 2. the ultra sad part was when i logged onto imdb and read that you pieces of trash actually gave this movie a 6.9 rating. this is a testament to all of the retards in our society that will go watch terrible movies that are just hour and a half long dick, fart, and weed jokes with little to no originality. after seeing this rating, i would like to suggest "tyler perry's house of pain" to all of you guys who enjoyed this film; you'll see some high quality humor there on about the same level of this abhorrent abomination.

it's hard to know exactly what to say about this ever so bland and dull little film. the story is predictable when not completely laughable. it's all a matter of "dutiful gestures" which, as presented here, carry absolutely no conviction. yes, the mgm "production values" are gorgeous, and yes, ms. lamarr was exquisitely beautiful, but she and the great spencer tracy have absolutely no "chemistry" together - and that's the only thing that would have made this parade of cliches at all effective... it's my understanding that this movie received poor reviews when it was originally released; the passage of time has not improved it.

i fully agree with the previous reviewer. there's no chemistry between spencer tracy and hedy lamarr, and the focus of the film is on their relationship. hedy lamarr isn't at her best, and spencer tracy appears to be naive, simple and overly-hopeful -- both in love and life; an idealist role that played out best in 'boys town'. if you can make it through the ridiculous crowd scene by the train station...whoa...it's rather slapstick and not worthy of any actor in the cast. not the best acting on anybody's part. miscast and mismatched. story is empty and various and disenfranchised input is apparent. hedy lamarr is her absolutely stunning herself, which is truly the best part of the film. spencer tracy can't match the sophistication of her beauty and wardrobe, and the film doesn't come off as believable for at least that reason.

hedy lamarr who may have been kept by more men on screen than any other actress, is again the kept mistress of kent taylor, society playboy and general all around rat. on a boat from the yucatan after taylor's given her the brush she tries suicide. but doctor spencer tracy saves her from drowning in the caribbean.tracy's quite the all around medical fellow. i guess he never heard the word specialist. he runs a clinic in manhattan for the poor and his trip was a sideline into medical research. lamarr and he marry and she tries to introduce him into her world and he even becomes a partner of society doctor louis calhern. of course kent taylor reenters the picture and the hollywood inevitable happens.watching i take this woman it seemed to me that the writers were very much influenced by tracy's oscar winning boys town. unfortunately his role as doctor karl decker ain't a patch on what he did as father flanagan. maybe they were trying to give father flanagan a little romance in his life in this film so to speak.tracy and lamarr did not get along too well. in fact this film was dubbed i retake this woman because the original director joseph von sternberg walked off the film, presumably because lamarr was not working out for him the way marlene dietrich did. she did lady of the tropics and then mgm went back to filming this with their contract director woody van dyke who was known for the speed of his productions. and a whole new supporting cast was brought in.fortunately both spence and hedy had better roles in store for both of them.

i adore hedy lamarr. i think she was vastly underrated as an actress during the 40s. she was the nastassja kinski of that era, and critics didn't take her seriously. having said all that...this film is a bore. when i watched it for the first time, i was shocked at the lack of continuity, not only in story, but in makeup and costumes. hedy's makeup changes from shot to shot. so does hair length and style. reason: this thing had so many writers and underwent so many stops and starts it's amazing they ever released it at all. her "lady of the tropics" began filming after this one began, yet it was released before "i take this woman." in fact, at the time, it was known in hollywood as "i re-take this woman." that should tell you something. i'm a spencer tracy fan as well, but he is awful here. i've read in various film histories that he absolutely despised hedy lamarr, and that looks perfectly obvious on film. no chemisty whatsoever. the story wanders around for reel after reel and finally just rolls to an end very strangely. i can't recommend this one at all.

i found this gem in a rack the local video rental store had of tapes which are exchanged among various rental outlets. 'the man who skied down everest'. hmm... never heard about it. the box reads of some japanese fellow who always wanted to ski down everest and actually did it. sounds interesting. i rented it. as expected it was documentary style. the first part can be summarized so: "i always wanted to ski down mount everest". this is followed by some footage of preparation for the event. lots of preparation footage. ok, i suppose it takes a lot of preparation. then we are treated to a protracted piece on the skier, yuichiro miura's philosophy on life etc. more filler follows and i begin to wonder where the skiing fits in to this show. more preparation is shown and they begin to make the trip to the mountain. more philosophy is shown. at last they arrive at the mountain and maybe perhaps he will get around to skiing down the friggin' thing. lots of climbing footage later there is a description of the parachute device intended to slow miuras' speed on the steep slope. finally he straps on the skis and gets ready to go.he's off... he skis about twenty feet and his skis shoot out from under him, he deploys the parachute and tumbles in an inglorious bundle for some distance down the mountain and that's that. end of story. what the heck was that?ok i can buy that he always wanted to ski down everest, made extensive preparations and actually tried it with camera crew in tow. it didn't work and he ended up tumbling down and almost killing himself, so what egregious hubris would inspire the man to release a film of it and call it skiing down everest? perhaps the title,"the man who's feet shot out from under him and he slid on his ass down everest" was just too long for the tape box.

i saw this film when it came out. let me see now--this guy who had earlier skied down mount fuji manages to accumulate the funding and hire personnel to document what sounds on the surface like a bold and daring act---to ski down the world's highest peak. well--and here comes the spoiler--what happens, see, after a large crew of people manage to help him get near the top--and a life is lost in the bargain--he gets on his skis, manages to make it down a very very short way, at which point his parachute opens...and that's that. and instead of burning the footage to hide this amazingly anticlimactic ending to an embarrassing debacle, the guy goes ahead and releases it. spoiler ends i do admire the amazing courage and effort it must have taken the film crew to get some of the stunning shots they got. another spoiler--oh yes, one of the sherpas is killed by falling into a crevasse. the narrator, who is quoting the "daredevil skier, casually remarks that, according to the sherpa religion, since this man's body cannot be recovered his soul will roam the world forever and never know rest. is it worth it, the narrator muses. yes he answers--because it served the purpose of letting this clown "ski down everest." i can't remember ever seeing a more meretricious piece of celluloid. this is one to miss at all costs.

if you are looking for a movie with beautiful shots of mount everest, then you may enjoy this movie. just skip ahead to the views of the mountain.(spoiler alert) however, if you, like me, believe that lives are precious and not to be wasted then this movie will leave a bad taste in your mouth. 6 people died, 5 sherpas and a member of the japanese party just so that one man could attempt to ski down mount everest.the question is raised in the movie about whether the continuation of the expedition to meet his personal goal was still worth the cost in lives, and he answers an emphatic "yes".the part about skiing is in the last 15 minutes. he skis for a short time, then falls the rest of the way until he comes to a stop in the snow.

i'm a huge lover of really bad b movies. and i especially love alien/scifi movies. i say the cheaper, cheesier, and campier the better. a low budget and a hokey idea are fun enough for most bad b movies, but this movie is so bad that i really felt embarrassed for the people who made the movie and for the schlocky ad-lib actors. first off, there's no real plot, it's all sort of situation "comedy" (if it can be called that). the "comedy" in this movie is more about characters saying, in essence, "look at me, i'm in this crazy situation! isn't this funny?", but it's only pathetic because nothing anyone's doing is that funny. there's no comedic acting skill, nor any kooky plot to carry all the very un-imaginative scenarios through this dreary turd.the bad comedy and lack of anything remotely comical is only worsened by the bad ad-lib acting, actors saying really stupid things over and over again (perhaps trying to ape for catch phrases, perhaps just b/c everyone in this is so bad), really unattractive women being played off as hot chicks, and people barfing and passing out in bathrooms.there was one middle aged actor toward the end of the movie who i could tell had some acting chops and was kinda' convincing in his role. he was as out of place as a solid bm in a weekend detox unit's bathroom. corey feldman was filmed for about 3 minutes in total (thankfully we didn't have to put up with him any longer), and he was filmed off site -- probably outside his apartment on the way out somewhere. he said a few really un-funny things about aliens and having sex with aliens and that was the extent of his appearance.if you value your life and the 90 minutes (and years of pain in remembering) you'll lose by watching this garbage, avoid it. if you do a lot of drugs, like adam sandler's comedy stylings (and thus have no standards whatsoever), and are considered mentally slow you might like this movie. p.s. i think the people who raved about this must work for troma or something, b/c i can't believe people can be so lame as to actually enjoy this movie. (do drugs really ruin your judgment that much?)

this is the story of a news investigator who hates his job - which prove why actors - even as weak as tom cruise and denzel washington - are on the big screen and your neighbors are not!i'll say this though - the better moments show some basis for being really funny (not just wacky), to keep trying, maybe taking some classes, and using the time to keep learning how to make a good movie. ("dude, where's my car" and the "scary movie" sequence have it all over this ... college attempt.)the lighting wasn't; the production wasn't; and the script had moments (the conversation from space - very nice try unconvincingly executed). (this reminded me of "dark star" - which is about being "lost in space" - but this movie is just lost.)the talent was the bartender (he said 'dog' so annoyingly that i knew he had to be acting... wasn't he? ... now that's acting!), the mark hammond guy, and marty. i guess i gave the movie a point for each one of them... 3/10.-ld______________________________________________my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/

this show makes absolutely no sense. every week, two ladies go to an estate to do some gardening, and every week without fail, they somehow stumble upon a murder. because everyone who owns a big house with a large garden is involved in a murder, right? but even if they did somehow happen to stumble upon murder after murder, wouldn't the smart thing to do be to tell the police? you know, the people who can actually do something about it... but every week, these two fools go around, polluting evidence, committing crimes of their own, and, in some cases, causing more murders. once they do miraculously solve the murders, there is no way the murderer could ever be convicted. all the evidence has been sabotaged. and you'd think people who are covering up murders would think not to hire these two, wouldn't you? yay! we've solved the murder! now like every other week, let's go and confront the murderer ourselves and, with no back-up, tell them that we know about it. there is no way we could get ourselves into any danger, is there? rosemary and thyme is one of the worst shows on television, and certainly the most ridiculous.

thank god this has not been renewed by itv.this series, while popular (god knows why) has a very simple - 'look i've found another body behind the flowers/bushes/trees/wherever they are working - for the sixteenth time this series' plot. the dialogue is so simple it's as though this has been written for children - talking down to the viewer and explaining every plot point.they just 'happen' to be around when someone does something out the ordinary - and no-one notices them.every time they look into and investigate someone's murder, they get in the way of everyone else - messing up the lives of all - including those completely innocent.they break and enter into people's homes, stealing items and evidence (even firearms) being nosey and getting into people's lives, spying on them and going through their stuff. they never apologise, never get caught or arrested (and if they do they can talk their way out of it, even though another character who does the same gets put in prison!!!).they always come up trumps. now i know that this is an easy going series, but i think that realistically this should not have made it past the first few episodes! put simply, it's unrealistic.i think that they have found enough bodies in the undergrowth both here and on the continent (where they are every other week), so i do hope it never comes back.itv should get some action on the screen instead of all the years of humdrum - 'someone's been murdered at the village fair - again' type series.

i saw this film at our crossroads film festival, and was looking forward to it because it was filmed in mississippi and starred karen black. i was severely disappointed by the clumsy script which never flowed and the apparent lack on the effort of the actors and director to understand anything about the culture they endeavored to portray. how did lee and griffin become such deep friends in five minutes? which of the two were f***ing the girl under the tree? it was unclear. and, there seems to be some law in hollywood about southern accents, and rarely do you hear anything remotely approaching the everyday sounds of the south., despite the awful, "this must be how they sound, just soften the "r"" approach to dialogue, so many times the actors lapse out of it altogether. aleksa especially sounded like a new york street tough during "emotional" scenes, and nobody sounded mississippian at all. walt goggins' character was supposed to have been from morgan city, louisiana yet sounded nothing like that city's blend of new orleans and cajun accents. the other bothersome point seemed to be an urge by the writer to make us all feel that every man must have homosexual urges inside him. before i start a firestorm here and am accused of homophobia, i've enjoyed many films with gay love themes, notably "punks" "when love comes" and "b monkey". but this seemed to be some man's wish about all young men. well, tennessee williams has already covered this ground, and did a far better job of it. so, i wonder, if the coen brothers can get regional accents and culture dead on in films set in minnesota and in mississippi, why can't anyone else? what a waste of my time.

mind-numbingly boring, utterly predictable and in the end simply laughable. that pretty much sums up the disaster that is indecent proposal. starting with a decent premise the whole thing just unravels and becomes a complete mess. basically the story boils down to the question, "would you let your wife sleep with another man for one million dollars?" here of course the answer is yes because otherwise we wouldn't have a movie. quite frankly, we'd have been better off if we didn't have a movie.our married (and financially troubled) couple are played by woody harrelson and demi moore. they go to vegas to get rich. yeah, that'll work. anyhow, a billionaire, played by robert redford, takes a liking to the wife and makes the million dollar offer. for one night with the wife he will give them financial security. the aftermath of that one night is what the movie is really all about. unfortunately nothing in that aftermath is the least bit entertaining. the script is so predictable you can say the characters' lines before they do. the performances leave much to be desired. harrelson would be better off sticking to comedies as this attempt at serious acting completely misses the mark. anguish is not something he seems capable of portraying. and it is quite safe to say that demi moore will never have to clear space in her home for any academy awards. why is she a movie star again? in a part that should be full of emotion she conveys none. only redford escapes mostly unscathed. he's appropriately slimy yet suave and clearly the best actor of the bunch. but he can't save this film. awful script, lousy acting, plodding pace, zero entertainment...indecent proposal is downright awful.

this was one of the biggest pieces of crap i have ever had to watch. i mean, seriously. how would anybody else feel if they were in woody harrelson's shoes and your wife was even considering it would be a good idea to sleep with the other guy even for a million bucks. after all, she was the one talking about it in bed and saying how it would be good for them since he can build his house or whatever with that money. woody never fully agreed to it until she talked him into it. how can you trust her? who the hell would actually even consider that if they were married? i don't care how desperate they were. that's the most ridiculous thing i have ever heard in my life. then, he flips out on her. apparently, he had no right to mistrust her, other than the fact that his wife just slept with another dude who is extremely rich and handsome. oh and wait, then he's supposed to apologize to her after she files for the divorce so she can be with the guy she slept with. of course woody has no right to say anything to her or mistrust her especially after she still has roy hobb's card in her wallet. then, at the end of the movie, she's apparently so in love with woody still and misses him so much, that she was not going to leave hobbs until he made some ridiculously stupid story up to try to hint to her to leave, and she bleeping thanks hobbs???? are you bleeping kidding me? was she under contract as his sex slave or something?? i mean what the bleep?? oh and wait it gets better. she bleeping kisses him passionately before she gets out of the car. yea, she's not a whore. oh, thank you for letting me go, let me go make out with you one last time for good ole' sake. smooch smooch, smooch even though i'm still married to a guy i left for a rich guy. i have never seen such a piece of crap in my life. how the hell are we supposed to feel good after that horrible ending? what was this movie supposed to represent? nothing came out of this! this was the most pointless movie i have ever seen in my life. two pathetic desperate people. if i were woody, i would tell her to go drown herself in that body of water they were near. apparently, he had no self respect. what the hell was roy hobbs thinking by taking this horrible role. i feel like puking after watching this. this movie was so bad, it was seriously laughable. i want those two hours of my life back that i wasted watching this piece of ****.

a good example of the differences between american and foreign cinema can be seen in a film i recently watched on television: indecent proposal.indecent proposal's two protagonists, david and diane murphy are played woody harrelson and demi moore. i'm not sure if it was their total lack of chemistry or that they were not acting well, but why we should care so much whether these two stay together was beyond me. love, affection, playfulness, attraction  none of these materialized on screen in their interactions together.since i knew that eventually robert redford would show up, it was clear from the beginning that the good part, the meat of the movie, would be the scenes between him and demi moore. poor woody harrelson just could not muster any emotion at all for the film. he seemed to be holding back, preoccupied with his receding hairline.ok, so fast forward. what idiots these two (diane and david) are for thinking they can win back the $50,000 they owe by gambling. no acting faux pas there, just hideously bad, lazy, unforgivable writing. of course they lose all their money. surprised? i know i wasn't. enter robert redford (john gage in the film)  a romantic, perhaps emotionally frigid man, an updated gatsby. a very good role and though not a great, great actor, next to those two, redford looks like olivier. he immediately falls in love and lust with diane and we the viewers for once feel it. this is how to love a woman! not david's way, trading gum mouth to mouth with diane on a slimy pier. (did i see that right?) as gage, redford wears a suit and tie in every scene. yes it's meant to instruct the seemingly brain dead audience that here is a rich man, but he also looks damn good and by this point the brain dead audience appreciates it! other wardrobe symbolism includes david's now-ironed shirts at the end of the film, signifying resolve, getting it together after a long interlude of forlorn wrinkled shirt wearing.and what is it with california garden parties as depicted in hollywood movies? suddenly everyone appears british, complete with lacy dresses, three piece suits for the men, hats (hats!) and of course the parasol. yes diane, her transformation to rich man's fiancée now complete, is there at the auction daintily twirling a parasol. though she insisted that she couldn't be bought, she succumbed at last to the sexual tension. here is where the film branches off into pure americana. i mean, of course david and diane will end up together, my question is: why? diane was bored with david, why not let her ride the robert redford wave? and i mean for a good long while? how can she pull herself out of the sexual-romantic thrall of this sexy older man so easily just because woody harrelson brings his receding hairline to the garden party, sits himself down and looks demi moore in the eyes. that's just not how it goes. he was so weak.but we must have our happy ending. we have to swallow the moral lesson. we're not sophisticated enough yet to have it otherwise. director lyn tried to make a fatal attraction for the juvie set, the young'uns.in addition to garden parties in which there's nary an suv, tee shirt, or baseball cap in sight, such films also feature a reliable public transportation system that connects far-flung california cities and municipalities. how else to symbolize the return to middle class or working class life?

this story had the potential of a good film. the difficult choice of love versus money and the angst and regret of making the wrong one. however the movie was ruined by the horrible miscasting of robert redford as the villain who offers $1,000,000 to sleep with demi moore. like redford has to pay for it. redford's boyish good looks and all american charm just don't cut it as an unlikeable, threatening, boor. redford's acting skillls are insufficient to make his character menacing. i can see it now, $1,000,000 to sleep with robert redford. ok says the lady but you will have to give me some time to raise the money. jack nicholson would have been perfect as the sleazeball.

astroesque (2 outta 5 stars)i have no idea what the title is supposed... even less of an idea of what is supposed to be going on in this movie half the time... yet, it still kept me sort of interested. this is low, low budget film-making along the lines of "el mariachi", filmed in 16mm... and, for what it's worth, the shots are very well-composed and visually stylish. directed, written by and starring comic book writer/artist michael allred... i guess it's no surprise that the film looks good. unfortunately, some of the acting is beyond bad... and the rest is competent at best. allred himself comes off the best... but only because he doesn't actually speak much. he just strides around looking cool most of the time... or running from crazed rednecks who are trying to kill him. the sound is also pretty bad... almost as if it was unfinished in places... maybe they couldn't afford to pay for the music they'd planned to use? strange, vaguely science-fictiony plot... similar in tone to "the man who fell to earth"... but most of the film boils down to a standard run-from-the-bad-guys and kill-them-before-they-kill-you plot. ultimately too oblique to be successful but not without interest for adventurous movie watchers.

this film coincides with mike allred's comic book mini-series, "red rocket seven" and tells the story of an alien who escaped to earth to wait for "astroesque" which ties into the book of revelations and the apocylpse. this is only part of a bigger story (if the movie confuses you, read "rr7" too). you can easily tell that allred is used to telling stories with pictures. the direction is very good and the effects aren't bad for a $500 budget. unfortunately, mike used many friends to play the roles and probably didn't have the heart to say that they couldn't act. also, mike is not showing his writing skills in this movie. his dialouge spoon-feeds the plot to you and doesn't let you enjoy the characters. this was actually disappointing considering his tremendous writing ability shown in his comic books. 4 out of 10.

this film is little more than an ersatz verhoeven. the filming is supposed to be tele-realistic, but is simply sickening. the parody disappears after about 15 minutes to be replaced by a story which seems to take itself seriously. the brechtian pauses for non-existent advert brakes are tedious, and even painful; undoubtedly there was no actual intention to render this film brechtian, it was just an accident which happened like that. if you want to see a parody of reality tv, watch celebrity deathmatch - it's funnier and wittier, and most importantly shorter. i have rarely felt so much pain whilst watching a film. to be avoided like a rabid rabbit.

i saw this film last night, a satire of the reality style programs that seem to be making the rounds at the moment.what can i say. i absolutely hated it. about as interesting as watching paint dry and with maybe one or two only slightly amusing moments.maybe it had something to do with me definately not being a fan of the survivor and big brother type shows, but if this had been a video/dvd or if i'd been watching at the cinema on my own i would have definately not endured more than the first 5 minutes.

the people who came up with this are sick and twisted freaks how the hell can you exploit people like this? tricking people into thinking that this is real? which i probably don't doubt that it is... i saw this thing for the very first time today series 7 and it made me sick to my stomach i almost threw up. i just couldn't stop crying my eyes out for these poor people and if that woman really did have that baby you should all be ashamed of yourselves!!!!!!!!!! i have a 4 month old daughter and it is just absolutely appalling that would put a "real" pregnant woman in so much fricken danger! you people are bloody animals and should be locked up for life allowing something like this to put on t.v. if this so called "reallity show" is for real then why isn't anyone being put in prison for allowing people to die and not doing a god damn thing about it. you all deserve to be friggen hunted down!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

i turned this off about 50 minutes into it! whoever the moron was who decided to steal the idea of koushun takami's book(battle royal), & make it into a pathetic reality tv show scenario, deserves to be shot!it has done the film industry a good turn though. now directors like william malone(fear dot com) can say "well at least it's better than series 7" this piece of crap & dracula 3000 tie for first place in the worst 100 movies ever made! be warned this is not a 'so bad it's good'flick!this is a disgrace to film makers everywhere! never see this movie!

despite the potentially fascinating premise, series 7 is weak attempt at attacking reality television. aside from its bargain basement production values, which present an eyesore 10 minutes in, the overall tone of the film is misguided. several reviewers have attacked the acting in the film, but i think the real problem is this lame attempt to make the film into a farce. aside from the fact that the jokes are not funny (a pregnant woman swears a lot, a young girl gets a bunch of guns), it doesn't gel with the overall tone of the film. had the makers actually made series 7 to bear a striking resemblance to actual reality tv-colorful yet hollow edits, lame sound effects, sweeping camera motions-maybe their point would have been more solid or at least more palatable. instead series 7 meanders through the already harried world of death and game show. you can just imagine the director slapping himself on the back for stating the obvious

tom selleck plays an absentee son to senile "pop" don ameche and weary mom anne jackson, making up for his indiscretions (one presumes) and taking them in after ameche has burned down his mobile home; meanwhile, selleck's job is vanquished by the f.b.i., his assets are frozen, his wife and kids leave him and his obnoxious sister and her brats have come to stay. brightly-painted comedy-of-ills is as out of touch with reality as ameche's doddering old coot. perhaps a serious first draft (with scenes such as ameche walking out into traffic with two toddlers) was incorporated into a sillier second or third version (with selleck getting poked, bumped, prodded, and eventually losing a toe and a testicle!). either way, it's a painful experience, and selleck's sudden dedication to his father makes little sense; he hobbles around and howls in pain, but retains his heart of mush. this movie is mush. * from ****

in fact, everyone responsible for this dreck ought to be whipped, dragged, and hung! if this is what great eugene o'niell drama is like i never want to be victim to viewing it ever again. there are so many things wrong w/ this feature where does one begin? first, elmer bernstein's bombastic score is present thru out the entire film even in the quiet scenes where background music subtracts from the character's motivations. second, these characters are not pleasant people and while some reviewers might enjoy that i personally disliked every scene in which ives ate up the scenery, but that was the way his characters was written: to be disliked. w/ loren it just never is made clear whether she's good or bad  and all her babbling about how she's going to change things back to the way they were before the baby arrives  well, i saw what was coming clearly. perkins is miscast and then he plays the role like a warm-up for norman bates (which he played two years later) even wanting to take blame for the murder at the end. hokey! third, this film is a studio sound-stage production and it suffers because of it. the story would have benefited from location shooting to develop a sense of "place" regarding the farm (which all the main leads are fighting over). as it is filmed there's no sense of value to the property because the film has a studio sound-stage feel to it that isn't convincing. this is a really awful film.

anthony perkins and sophia loren are absolutely gorgeous in this ca. 1840 "western". that alone, however doesn't help a ridiculous story, with countless historically incorrect elements.byrl ives is convincing as the 70-something tyrannical patriarch, an egomaniac who swears to see his 100th birthday. his wild dancing at a party he gives for his neighbors will make anyone take notice (this guy is sevety six?). always mumbling bible verses, he demands respect, while driving sons and friends away with his self-righteous rantings and emotional cruelties.the love affair between perkins and loren at first appears absurd, but becomes believable near the end. there is plenty of drama, but not enough to feel good about. clearly written for the stage, this story was dated even when it was filmed. perkins whistles "my bonnie" in the 1840s, although the song wasn't composed until 1882.critics knocking sophia lorens "command of the english language" are rather petty. i found her english flawless and completely audible. as a neapolitan, loren speaks a distinct dialect that often had to be dubbed into "proper italian". her "accent", however, hardly affects how she speaks english. as a first generation german american, i can appreciate the efforts of those who learn english as a second, or even third or fourth language."desire under the elms" is a drama (or even a tragedy) in the classic sense. for my enjoyment is was missing a logical story and an overall "pay off" for the time invested. fans of the stars won't want to miss it, others, however, tune in at your own risk!

just finished watching this movie. i couldn't imagine watching this on vhs, as there were scenes where i needed the subtitles to hear through an accent or sound effect, even though the scene itself was in english.visually, the movie is pretty appealing. the few cg effects were very obvious insertions, but the prosthetics/creature effects weren't bad. not perfect, but photography and editing (which were pretty good) made up for a lot. acting was generally bad, though how much of that can be blamed on the director i couldn't say, having never seen any of the actors before. the exception, i think, was m. gomez (uxia). she stole every scene she had a part in, and not just because of a very pretty face, but there was something akin to an urgency to her performance that none of the others had. the writing could have been a lot better - the plot was still unmistakably lovecraft, and plenty of lovecraft details were written in, but i personally could have done without most of the dialogue.

i totally agree that the reenactments kill what could otherwise be a great show. i'll admit that i'd seen 1 or 2 episodes last season and was not clear at all that it was all reenacted. but when i caught one episode recently it suddenly jumped out at me big time and i lost interest immediately. then i noticed the disclaimer at the start before an episode that followed. has anyone followed the show closely enough to tell me, did they actually make the "acting" and reenacting parts more artificial on purpose, or did i just not notice before. i'm usually pretty good at sensing this stuff, but the recent episode was so obviously artificial i practically tripped over it. now i have no interest whatsoever in watching and have given up entirely on it. it just doesn't have any real value if it's all scripted and acted. and at least lately, it seems very poorly scripted and acted. the comment above that says who cares if it's all reenactments, i do. without visual truth, this is just a bunch of "you know what happened, one time this guy" heresay. it's info better read in a book.

i cannot believe i actually set up a 'season pass' on my tivo for this, apparently they had a good preview or something .. i can't imagine it though. after seeing about 5 minutes i thought to myself.. why am i watching this.. it is definitely not reality, and some of the worst acting i have ever seen on television.. i am a total addict of reality tv and there is nothing real about this. the acting.. (if you can call it that) is awful.. the only ones that are almost 5% decent are the girls that are meant to draw viewers to the show.. although they would need to be a lot prettier to save this train wreck.. if they would have more lines they would probably change my mind as they probably have no talent either. this is obviously a very low budget production with 'actors' who are apparently very cheap. there is no way they could get a job in anything else. someone needs to direct these people to a job in food service.. maybe they could do that. oh and by the way, parco p.i. no longer occupies any space on my tivo or tivo's season pass list. definitely the worst show i've ever seen.

awful, awful, awful show. "real world" issues dealt with blatant unoriginality. stereotypes galore. what the hell is going on with the african-american (black!) guys eyebrows? tyrone power! awful, awful, awful, awful, awful show. the fact that it lasted three seasons beggars belief. this show truly is swill for the brain dead accepters of mediocrity. saved by the bell almost seemed humorous compared to this. well, upon hindsight, no. it's of the same banal ilk and therefore equally devoid of intelligence. the only thing that it's missing so far is the jesus is god message. the mentality and deliverance is the same, yet somehow feels evil and soulless. you can almost hear the tv executives sprouting buzz words at each other. in fact i felt so incensed at this shows excremental existence, i felt compelled to comment. awful, awful, awful show.

i can't help but be completely annoyed by this sitcom. it's like they didn't even bothered trying ro write good comedy, just rehash third rate jokes and hope it sticks. the worst of all this is that it's all so damm uninteresting and lacking in every way.to make things worse leading man kevin james has a permanent "i'm so funny" smug grin on his face that would be tolerable if only he once delivered in the comedy department, which he doesn't, he just lies there doing nothing like a big unfunny baby. which takes me to the relationship between the heffernan's- easily the most insincere and poor representation of a married couple on any tv show, really headache inducingly obnoxious remini spends the whole show as if it where a violent chore to even be around her own husband. jerry stiller yanking the few laughs on the show is doing a 100% repetition of his role as frank costanza in seinfeld only this time his hints mostly tread on water due to the inability of the central duo in recognizing a joke even if it flew by them. the episodes just drift along in a stream of nothingness, their jobs add nothing and their interaction is even worse.this is not even a waste of talent, there is no talent here, this is a laughless creative desert.

this is a lame comedy.here's why: a man and wife sitcom. okay.the husband is a douche bag. the wife is the einstein.how original is that? jerry stiller is just the same guy on seinfeld.the gags are lame. no witty one-liners.i have had enough. stop this now.the last word: stupid. the destruction of the average white guy continues on abc. the worst part? kevin james is actually a funny comedian. he just isn't here. leah remini is great eye candy, but is unlikeable. wasted talent is the word. bad sitcom.

a show about an incredibly dumb, man-child and his shrewish hot wife. 99% of the plots revolves around doug doing something unbelievably stupid and then comes a variable: a) either he hides it from his wife or b) tell his wife, she emasculates him and then it's up to the father-in-law (arthur: the typecast character from seinfeld) to aggravate the situation.and the writers dare to say it was influenced by the "honeymooners" (an absolute classic) and that the plots are drawn from real-life situations, unless you live in a cave, you know that's not true.anyway, let's just put it this way. if kevin james had been thin, the show would have got canceled fromm the pilot. if you're 12, or you're fond of fat jokes.. be my guest, watch this show (or any of kevin james movies for that matter).i've noticed some posters compare this travesty to much superior shows like friends, seinfeld and everybody loves raymond -- i'm still wondering how could anyone do that

this show uses a rather tired sitcom formula of the fat idiot blue collar slob with the pretty (and sometimes shrewish-seeming) wife and crazy in-law(s). with this show, it's fat unfunny comedian kevin james as doug hefferman who works as a delivery driver for a parcel service. he has a pretty wife, carrie (leah remini), who works as legal assistant, and senile father-in-law, arthur spooner (jerry stiller), who lives in his daughter and son-in-law's basement. kevin james' doug is your typical beer drinking, sports loving, tv watching slob of a sitcom husband who would rather watch the tube than deal with his marital issues. he also has a couple of idiot friends who lend extra stupidity to the problems encountered by this show's couple. beyond the few laughs supplied by jerry stiller's crazy old man character this show was generally unfunny. kevin james' imbecilic behavior usually caused the show's problems that usually resolved by his wife. this show continued a run of sitcoms with the fat stupid father/husband and their pretty wives that all seemed to run on abc for some reason.

i am very diplomatic in my reviews, and as an academic writer, try to give creative license to tv writers trying to explicate a true story. this story, about karen carpenter, could have helped so many, yet due to the directing and editing, does not.the story, in this case, is not fully addressed, unless one reads psychological journals. while cynthia gibb portrays a realistic karen, it is sad that so much has been edited...louise fletcher portrays her mother, and does an excellent job, with limited material and dialogue. in this case, i give the actors credit for surviving this project.why is the audience not permitted to see causation factors?....american audiences are quite savvy, and if they have cable, usually educated.i sincerely feel that i could have written a better story, would not have edited out the truth, and allowed the actors to project the reality.richard carpenter, as director, has seriously underestimated and insulted american audiences. karen's story is important, and it is sad we will never hear it.

1993 was a time of change in the wwe but for this wrestlemania they decided to wind back the clock as hulk hogan returned, along with his good friend brutus beefcake, who had been out of wrestling since a paragliding accident in 1990.this was not a great event. only two matches had any real build and the whole thing came off as being rushed. the in ring action wasn't great and the twist at the end, which i'll discuss later, really wasn't the earth shattering moment the wwe hoped it would be.this forgettable night started off with shawn micheals defending his intercontinental championship against the undefeated tatanka. tatanka had beaten michaels a couple of times leading into the fight. michaels had a new manager, luna vachon while tatanka was accompanied by michaels' former manager and future wwe hall of famer sherri martel. tatanka won by dq. michaels kept his title and went straight back into his feud with marty janetty, which had been put on hold just for wrestlemania. why, i have no idea.next up saw the steiner brothers (scott and rick) defeat the headshrinkers (samu and fatu) with scott scoring the pin after hitting samu with the frankensteiner. good match.doink the clown needed help from another clown to win his match against crush. a second doink distracting crush when he was in complete control and allowing doink to get the pin and the victory. doink was an entertaining gimmick character, who got old rather quickly.razor ramon easily defeated the returning bob backlund in the next match.this brings us to the first in our double main event. as the mega maniacs team of hulk hogan and brutus beefcake, with the newly turned good guy jimmy hart in their corner, took on hart's former buddies money inc (ted dibiase and irwin r shyster). this was a fairly sketchy finish. beefcake, as mentioned, had been in a paragliding accident requiring full facial surgery and had wrestled the match with a face mask on. shyster ripped the mask off him and beat beefcake to a pulp. the ref went down, hogan grabbed the face mask and knocked out dibiase and shyster and then hart, who was wearing a referee shirt, counted the three. another ref came down and reversed the decision, declaring money inc winners by dq.next up lex luger or the narcissist as he was also known at the time defeated mr perfect. this match came about because luger was being managed by perfect's old manager bobby heenan. perfect had is feet on the ropes when he was pinned, but the ref missed it.the undertaker picked up a lacklustre dq victory in a pretty poor match against the giant gonzales. the undertaker had earned the ire of gonzales' manager harvey wippleman in 1992 and taker had defeated his big monster kamala at survivor series. wippleman vowed revenge and took it at the royal rumble as gonzales attacked taker, costing him the match. gonzales dominated undertaker in this match, but was dq'd for choking taker out with chloroform. weird finish to a bad match.this bought us to our main event as wwe champion bret hart, seriously challenged as champion for the first time, put his title on the line against mr fuji's unstoppable monster yokozuna. yokozuna controlled the early going, but hart resisted and then took control. he had yokozuna in the sharpshooter, surely he would give in and hart would be established as an heroic hero after taking out the big monster. but fuji had other ideas, throwing salt in hart's face, rendering the canadian helpless as yokozuna got the pin.what a downer ending. but wait here comes hulk hogan. he's checking hart to make sure he's ok. suddenly fuji challenges hogan to a wwe title right then and there. hogan accepts. fuji throws salt towards hogan, but hits yokozuna instead. hogan hits the leg drop and wins the match and the title. what did i just watch? and so, what most fans thought was going to be the night we either saw hart establish himself as a giant killer, or yokozuna establish himself as an unstoppable monster, we instead saw hulk hogan pick up a meaningless title win. a title that he would not defend for three months. as a matter of fact this was the only match hogan wrestled for the wwe before the king of the ring ppv in june 1993.

i liked the whole set up with ceasar's palace, the roman guards, and announcers in togas. this event also marked "the passing of the torch" as far as the voice of the wwf goes. gorilla monsoon who had done the play by play for every wwf ppv up to this point opens up and gives the typical introduction making it look like he's there to announce another ppv. but then introduces jim ross who is making his wwf debut and jr continues to do the wwf commentary to this day. but outside of that, this event is pure garbage. good ol scientific wrestling has been thrown out the window and enter the birth of gimmicks. this to me was the event that the wwf started to go down the toilet, and didn't recover until the attitude era of the late 90's. here's a review of the event.ic title match: tatanka (challenger) vs. shawn michaels (champ): an okay opener, but given what shawn is capable of, it was very disappointing. i have no idea why the wwf was hell bent on putting tatanka over. they should of realized that shawn was the future and tatanka was just some hyper wrestler in an indian gimick. the ending of the match itself was very lame. shawn grabs the ref and pulls him out, then gets called for a count out. while it was fun watching sherri get beat up afterwords, this match just was forgettable. shawn had to carry this match and had trouble doing it.the stenier brothers vs. the headshrinkers: steiners get the win via a franknsteiner. this match had it's moments, but the crowd just didn't seem into it. there was no heat behind it, i think it was a match just to throw two tag teams in.crush vs. doink the clown: terrible! terrible! terrible! this match completely sucked. two very lame gimmicks. a clown and a hawaiian dressed in bizarre colors. the ending caught everybody by surprise. in the upcoming months, crush turned heel and doink turned face, but none of the fans seem to care. sadly, this was not the worst match on the card.razor ramon vs. bob backland: you got a brand new heel that is very over going against a wrestler who was forgotten about 10 years ago. the fans snicker and laugh when backlund comes out. and like hogan/rock in wm18 and hhh/owen in wm14, the heel wrestler gets louder cheers in the face. thankfully this match was short. the right guy won, but i wish they had razor totally beat the crap out of and squash backlund rather than winning by a small package out of nowhere.tag team champion match: ted dibiase and irs (champs) vs. hulk hogan & brutus beefcake w/jimmy hart i still would like to know the full story on what happened to hogan's eye. oh well. the crowd was really into this match, but it had no flow to it what so ever. hogan and beefcake were clearly suffering ring rust given that both wrestlers had been on the shelf for at least a year. dibiase, being the great technical wrestler that he was, did help to carry the match from being a complete waste. the ending was a surprise with dibiase and irs getting the win via dq. but to please the crowd, hogan and beefcake did their usual playing to the crowd at the end like they had won the match.lex luger vs. mr. perfect: the best part of this match was the four hot chicks that accompanied lex luger to the ring. other than that, this was completely forgettable. the mr. perfect gimmick was born for a heel role and he just lacked the heat as a face. and luger is just a waste of time no matter what gimmick he's in. luger wins via a backslide despite that perfect's feet were in the ropes. then perfect spends the post match getting his butt kicked. first luger knocks him out with the running elbow. then when perfect regains consciousness he goes back to the dressing room to find luger only to get the crap beaten out of him by shawn michaels, setting up an hbk/perfect feud that had the potential to be a classic but the wwf misused.the undertaker vs. giant gonzales: absolute crap!! what was the wwf thinking bringing in such a horrible wrestler as giant gonzales. sure he had size, but i'd rather watch the brooklyn brawler in a match than him. this isn't even worth commenting on.wwf championship match: bret hart (champ) vs. yokozuna (challenger) you have one of the greatest technical wrestlers of all time going against a guy who's only advantage is that he's a gigantic lard ass. bret was able to carry the match, but a rather predictable ending with mr. fuji throwing salt in bret's face.post match: yokozuna vs. hulk hogan pure crap right here. hogan comes down to the ring for no apparent reason and mr. fuji challenges him to a match after yoko just won the title. even the die-hard hulkamaniacs find this to be total bs.

i have been a fan of the carpenters for a long time, read the biography, watched the specials, and saw the karen carpenter story. this movie really didn't show the real karen carpenter. in the movie she seems to be a shy and a pretty much of loner (except for one girl friend). the real karen carpenter was much different. she was outgoing and friendly. she had lots of friends, especially olive newton-john. the movie doesn't even show karen's attempts for a solo album and her meeting phil ramone and his wife itchy "karen". itchy knew the real karen carpenter in new york. when karen was in new york, she did see a psychologist, but it was voluntary and once a day and then she would leave to go to her hotel room. also, karen was taking pills to increase her thyroid, so she could loss weight, but stop taking them because the psychologist recommended her not too. also, the karen's husband in the movie is named bob knight, but in real life was named tom burris. also, karen wasn't divorced from tom, but only separated. karen was to sign the divorce papers on the day she died. also, agnes found karen naked in the closet unciousness, unlike in the movie where she was dressed in white. the music was very good. that was the only thing i would recommend on seeing it.

for any wrestling fan, this is the wrestlemania to forget. no logic to the matches, some garbage gimmicks (doink the clown, and the giant gonzalez) this was a forgettable ppv something rare for the wwe(f). the logic of hogan winning the world title at the end made no sense, and many people feel that alone help put the nail in the ppv. from the meaningless gimmicks of the roman soldiers, to simply some real bad wrestling (doink vs crush being the worst match) to simply bad match making (scott "razor ramon vs bob backlund, how can you have one of the greatest mat wrestlers, making a comeback, and working his first wrestlemania, face a power wrestler who was undefeated at the time), this is a ppv that even the wwe has since admitted, was way below what the expected. just all around a stinker

this movie was a waste of time. it looks nice, pretty settings, nicely acted, appears earnest and seems to be leading somewhere so you stay tuned awaiting a meaningful payoff. it doesn't happen. it surprised me that so much effort could be put into a movie, it was clearly very professionally done, and have an outcome that seems nothing short of a b-movie.save your precious time and see a good french film like les visiteurs (funny), jean de florette or manon of the spring. i can't recall the language in europa europa, but that's another great film--heavy but very worth viewing.this film appears to promise a lot but delivers nothing.

i think it is very interesting this movie is called a thriller. it is anything but thrilling.most of the time you hear piano sounds. then you hear piano sounds. then some people talk about facts which do not concern anybody.then again piano sounds.to be honest, this movie was the reason for me to register at imdb, because i think this movie is one of those which humankind has to be warned of.spoiler: by the way, the most action-like part happens when a can of hot chocolate is spilled.also very interesting: the "actors". yes, the quotes are intentional, as you can think, because they do not act. they play piano and do smalltalk, but it's not acting they do.i think before this movie i never left a cinema and felt angry. really, this film made me angry. angry for the time and money i spent on it.

something does not work in this movie. there are absolutely no energies between the actors. in fact, their very acting seems frozen, sometimes amateur. also, the script is not convincing and not reliable.

the dominating conflict is between a couple of fine actors (huppert and dutronc) and the horrible script. evidently, the actors lost, since the director/screenwriter claude chabrol eventually forced the leading couple to follow this worthless piece of sick imagination to the letter. fortunately, the powerful performances by huppert and dutronc dramatically improve the overall quality of the movie, which miraculously gains the depth and humor. as for chabrol's persistence in keeping the film bland and illogical, it reaches the climax in the final scene, which is so incredibly poor that you will wonder which pills he was taking himself while directing it.

the french either make pro-marxist films or anti-marxist films - with a few in between. "merci pour le chocolat" is the latter of this genre. from the opening credits telling the viewer what music is going to be played and by whom it was who composed you know that you are going to be swathed in middle class pretension. it is an old man's film with an excess of 40's plus people. it is also directed by an old man along with an old crew who have nothing to say about life to the viewer. the plot is not only banal but preposterous. how many films reveal the plot through dialogue only to repeat the same message via flashback some five minutes later? maybe the director and actors had a low retentive capacity? in truth their is no tenable plot at all. it is riddle with holes like a good piece of french cheese.whether intentional or not, it is a film about the bourgeoisie. at least a third of the film focuses on the piano and the pretentious twaddle espoused in each scene. i concede it has some well framed shots though they couldn't have used a steady-cam in this film - it would have woke them all up! other than it being a nonsense story, the film allows the upper middle class to parade their values and vanity in a very comfortable swiss location. a telling line of the film is when rodolphe pauly tells anna mouglalis that she need not lock her car while in the resort! oh dear me.on the dvd, miss huppert makes a comment about shedding a false tear for a scene. smirking she says: "like they do in the american actor's studio!" i think miss huppert and the rest of the cast could learn well from the actor's studio.if there is one statement that stand out in my mind it is when huppert remarks 'we are having friends for the weekend and all the servants are away'. no doubt they had all escaped from the mind numbing set lest they be associated with such an appalling film.safety medical note. in the film they show a hot water scald being covered with ointment and a bandage. this should never be done. only cold water should be used.minus 10 marks.

the beginning of the film is promising. when jeanne pollet(anna mouglalis) hear the story of the incident that happen on the day she was born that raise the possibility that she is the daughter of a famous pianist, andré polonski (jacques dutrone), she set to find out whether it's true or not, and giving the fact the she plays also the piano that's not such a remote idea. jeanne meet andré and his wife "mika" muller(isabelle huppert) and their son and on the way uncover the fact that there are some secrets in that family as much in her own.o.k. we have seen this before and it has been done in a more interesting way than here.the character of "mika" muller is left with out us understanding her motives to her action and she is not interesting enough to care for her. the piano scenes look fake and the whole piano sub-plot doesn't add anything to the character's insight but serve as to make the film longer than it should have been in the first place.in short a very disappointing outing from chabrol, who can do better than this

i did not like this film at all: the scenario is boring - and after a while, its primitive predictability really gets on your nerves. even if you give chabrol a high bonus for not being a beginner, i did not manage to find anything specially interesting on his characterization of mika neither.

this is the second adaptation of charlotte armstrong by claude chabrol for the screen:the first was " la rupture" (1970)(from novel "the balloon man" )and it's really a pity no one cares about it.it's chabrol's sleeper,and i urge any of his fans to see it."the chocolate" cobweb was not that strong a detective story to begin with.i read it 20 years ago and forgot all about it.the movie promises some good things at first,though,then finally disappoints to a fault.this is a confusing chabrol movie,mixing elements of the heyday (circa 1969),and a lotta tongue-in-chick stuff coming from the eighties ,the likes of 'poulet au vinaigre",not one particularly memorable work.part of the disappointment comes from the cast:this is a distressingly poor gathering:jacques dutronc plays like a zombie,isabelle huppert reveals herself a somewhat limited actress,finally rather vulgar .it worked in "une affaire de femme",it does not here.they are not supported by the young couple :both are bland and unremarkable.actors from the past,say,stephane audran or michel bouquet(both in "la rupture") were brilliant and contributed to chabrol's then unique atmosphere.the story itself is undistinguished:beginning as some kind of "serious" "la vie est un long fleuve tranquille " (besides,a character hints at etienne chatilliez's very funny movie),the movie drags on and on as a laughable psychological drama afterwards.we will not congratulate the young female pianist ,who,after all she learned about her wicked hostess,agrees to drive a car along a dangerous road.because he makes too many movies,chabrol frequently releases turkeys.one wonder why people who wants to watch one of his movies should choose this one among all his stuff up for grabs.it seems that chabrol's bourgeoise satire has finally given way to leniency.in "la rupture" the first armstrong adaptation-an average detective story which chabrol completely transcended-,you should hear audran say "they have so much money!".here ,chabrol has lost his bite,his strength.

oh boy, oh boy. this movie is something for the lovers of "real" cineatique art. it really does not make any sense at all. it is totally boring, especially because of the "anti-climaxes". all people behave more than strange, and unrealistic. sometimes it feels like sitting in a theatre, because in dialogues the actors tend to face the camera (and therefore the audience) instead of each other. like i said before, if you are in to those more artful movies, shown in cannes - go for it. if you are not, better leave this movie alone, because you will be more than disappointed, and in the end know that you have wasted your time - like i did. two thumbs down... :-(((

i've become a big fan of the carpenters, and i didn't really enjoy this movie.i feel it focused far too much on her anorexia and didn't let her true personality shine through. i wasn't overly fond of cynthia gibb's portrayal; especially knowing she decided karen's anorexia was suicide, which it clearly wasn't. although her family was not big on hugs and kisses, i thought the movie portrayed agnes (their mother) as being terrible.i did find a few scenes to be harrowing in a way, such as where she sees herself in a mirror that seems to distort her and make her look heavier; i thought the metaphor (so-to-speak) there was rather effective. when the family is playing pool and discussing her divorce and she breaks down and richard is shocked when he comforts her and feels her frail body was pretty moving (which is probably the wrong word) as well.overall, i feel they needed to bring out her more bubbly, quirky side--her genuine personality. even as the focus of the film, there really wasn't a point that caused one to understand what would lead her to anorexia (though of course no one can really know), and almost made it seem baseless. the film was more poor-singer-with-anorexia than karen carpenter's story, in my opinion.i would assume that they changed her husband's name/profession and all because they couldn't get his permission to actually include him (there were some bad terms there), but that whole aspect was inaccurate with the changes. on this note, i can't recall the movie bringing out her longing for a family and kids, which greatly prevailed in her life and explains her whirlwind romance and quick marriage to her husband.on the whole, it ends up as a low-budget made-for-tv movie that just isn't very high quality and can be disappointing if you're a hardcore fan who is hoping to see beyond karen's disease. i feel that such a legend deserves/deserved a better film as a tribute to an amazing person and an awesome voice.

before going any further, i have to admit that i only saw the first episode of this show. if i had the time, i might have considered watching it every week, if only to see how the season played out. however, it was very clear to me from the beginning that martha stewart's version of "the apprentice" just doesn't "fit in." martha stewart made a career of being a happy homemaker, a domestic diva of the likes of oprah winfrey and julia child. it was only since her scandalous legal troubles and subsequent incarceration that her public image began to reflect the true roughness of her character. sure, she was compelling for a while, and this entire series poses the interesting question of what it means to be a woman in business. does she have to come off as cold and tough? shouldn't she?but the truth was, by the time stewart came out of prison, her attempts for a public comeback, though certainly warranted, were never going to seize viewers' interest for very long. perhaps a true comeback would have worked had she returned home peacefully and waited a year or so after her often mocked ankle bracelet was removed. instead, she frantically dove into overkill with 2 series at once, the other being her syndicated daytime series martha, much like her old show, but more mainstream, with famous guests like bette midler. of course, even at her peak stewart was never mainstream, so it's too much to ask that american audiences immediately accept her foray into reality tv. maybe america wants stewart to make a comeback on her own rather than be the basis for it.the show was basically a tired retread of trump's "apprentice," which still holds my interest, depending on the tasks, the cast, and trump's firing decisions (often controversial - likely for that reason). the letter bit was certainly not cliché but obnoxious in the least. the fact that stewart never says, "you're fired!" - mentioned in the message board on this site - is particularly distressing. producer mark burnett should be admired for dealing with stewart's jail time honestly while trying to make her a hero, but the truth is that anyone watching can tell that she's basically trying to put on a show of being this nice businesswoman. again never mainstream, stewart lacks the agreeability and identifiability of oprah winfrey and the admirable, charismatic "toughness" of donald trump. yes, this can be a gender-biased assessment of her character, but i mean it to be more about the nature of her business.it comes as no shock that stewart has been fired, but i wonder if they really always intended it to only last for one season?

jesus christ, what the hell happened here?. this is one of the most boring movies i have ever seen, how is it possible that they screwed up such a nice idea for a movie. to tell you the truth i was so hyped for this, i though it was like blair witch but with actual alien creatures chasing the camera guy. goddamn it, i have been reduced to fast forwarding this pile of sh*t, and i never do that while seeing movies. the high rating here on imdb makes me believe that actual aliens are giving 10's for this piece of crap.invasion is about well, an invasion. the movie starts by saying that everything you're about to see is real, blahblahblah. then they go and tell me about a special camera system used in cars, as if i need to believe their bullsh*t to enjoy this movie. next thing you know i'm seeing the most boring car driving ever filmed, in a forest at night mind you. is this a movie, or a disney theme park ride? the first 20 minutes is all boring dialog between cops while seeing grass and one straight road with a flashlight. where the hell were the aliens?! they were sleeping of course! then we learn that bad acting is not only reduced to high school plays, as the cop behind the camera goes out of his car to look for a missing man who was 'nightfishing' and had stumbled upon a mysterious meteorite. i wonder what happens to him? out of nowhere, we see the 'nightfishing' guy walking like a zombie. the cop is apparently too dumb to notice that something is wrong with this man. apparently he was indeed dumb, as the zombie/alien guy injects in the cop's ear some sort of alien parasite, thus changing him into an alien. then the cop/alien goes back into his car, looks for a young couple that were having sex a while back in the forest, gets to them, changes the guy into an alien, and then the girl runs to the cop's car and escapes. if this quick plot introduction didn't get it in your head that this movie was bad, then the following 40 minutes will. watching this movie is as painful as stabbing yourself repeatedly with a plastic fork. the script, while it may sound interesting on the back of the dvd box, is badly directed and sadly, we are left with another boring straight to dvd atrocity.the only thing that kept me awake were the constant flashing and loud sound effects (lamentably). if seeing the same forest trail for 63 minutes is not enough, we must endure crappy flashing techniques to "scare" the viewer and constant wailing of a bad actress that gets old and annoying pretty quick.if you feel you must rent this, i say to you, why? there are better scifi/horror films out there. even the dreaded remake of the invasion of the body snatchers is more entertaining than this. for the love of all things good, don't bother with his crap. my eyes bled, and for the first time, i wanted suicide. a 1/10, avoid this like a disease.

here is a fantastic concept for a film - a series of meteors crash into a small town and the resulting alien infection is caught on a deputy's single camera dash cam as the town slowly taken over. leave it to albert pyun to screw that up! don't get within 100 feet of this flick! holy crap, what a bomb...it might be pyun's worst yet! the crazy thing is there is the germ of a creative idea in here - an entire of an outbreak told from the pov of a dashcam. when i heard that a while back, i imagined the car smashing into stuff, people getting run over, and infected types breaking the windshield and surrounding the car in chaos. that would be cool right? instead, we have the lead driving around in circles for the entire time in a wooded area, occasionally running into the three infected types who just stand there. the last bit is literally a 15 minute shot where nothing happens in front of the camera, just noises are heard offscreen. stay away!!! on a somewhat relieving note, i think i am officially calling an end to my pyun watching...only took me 20 crappy movies to realize i have better things to do.

okay, first i should say that i assume this was just made by a group of friends with a limited budget. with that in mind, it really shouldn't be compared to blockbuster features and my rating would be higher. but still...after giving it a chance, it still violated some basic film-making rules to such an extent that both the viewer and the amateur director in me cringed. a lot.think: blair witch in a car but really boring.think: you left your camcorder on the dashboard and recorded yourself getting lost in the park at night for an hour, then making your friends watch it.the scariest part (possible spoiler alert... if spoiling here is possible) was at one point the picture rewinds and you might think you will have to watch it all over again. scary.silliness aside, this is a pretty good idea for a low-budget lets-go-make-a-movie-tonight film. but the concept walks a fine line between being really good and really bad, and let's just say it wasn't really good. there were just too many parts where nothing happened. at first i thought that was the director's plan -- you were supposed to be lulled into a sense of security and then really scary things would start happening. but...no.i kept trying to find good things to say about it (and i had plenty of time to think), and i'll say the music was kinda cool. and i have to give the female lead credit for standing around by herself looking scared for a really, really long time. but that's it. the actors playing "infected" people looked as if they were making fun of zombie movies. or they got their motivation from the bug wearing his edgar suit from "mib." chances are, if for some strange reason you're going to watch this movie, it's on dvd or tivo, so you can fast forward it whenever waiting for something to happen gets too difficult.i hate to be so critical of something, but at the same time i've watched a lot of similar movies and nothing has ever been this painful. if they just chopped a half an hour out of it and added some scary stuff, it might be decent. maybe that'll be the director's cut...

hey ....i really do not know why this film has been appreciated so much,perhaps i missed the point.the way i see it , a lot of international film makers have made brilliant films that have dealt with 'schizophrenia' and have informed ,excited ,shocked,evoked emotion and compelled the audience to step aside from their own reality and think.........while it is true that aparna sen's endeavor was an ambitious one ,in light of all the other movies , this one falls short..... miserably......it was too slow, there were no details about anything and the ending .... was completely ...pointless......it was not open ended or anything ....just pointless.....so watch it if you want to see a good concept completely wasted.......

this is a film that really makes me cringe. in 1951, mgm and looney toons were making some of their very best cartoons--with amazing animation, exceptional backgrounds and great stories. then, in the late 40s, a new style of animation began to appear (such as the "crusader rabbit" series on tv)--animation with extremely simplistic artwork in order to save money. unfortunately, columbia picture's cynical ploy worked!! instead of the public hating the toons (as they should have), many accepted them and the oscar people (ampas) actually gave this film the award for best animated short--giving legitimacy for an inferior product. unfortunately, in the dollars and sense world of hollywood, this soon began to creep into the products of legitimate studios--resulting in rather crappy cartoons. later, it got even worse as in addition to lousy animation and backgrounds, the stories themselves became almost unbearable for adults to watch. the cleverness and style of the classic cartoons were gone. and for this tragedy, i blame, in part, gerald mcboing-boing--one of the granddaddies of cheap cartoons. the story isn't that bad but the animation is a horror and listening to the kid saying "boing-boing" incessantly is a pain.

with several name actors (lance henrikson, david warner, joe don baker), why was jeffery combs given the lead? henrikson would have been a perfect fit for the lead, as would warner, baker or even others in the movie such as charles napier. combs was miscast in this, and did a poor job of it. everything he did seemed fake or contrived.the script is poor. meaning that if lance henrikson (or another) had the lead role, he might have saved the film (removed it from my "waste of time" category), but it still would have been a bad movie. the screen play was completely lacking. the director should have recognized this and helped the movie along.

'felony' is a b-movie. no doubt about it.of course, if you take a look at the cast lineup you might have some high hopes for its entertainment potential. this film is stuffed with all of those wonderful character actors that you grew up with, the ones with the faces you immediately recognize even though you probably don't know their names. it's amazing that the filmmakers were able to get all of these people together on one project, almost like they decided to do a b-movie actor reunion. the cast even includes a couple of really first-rate actors: david warner, who most people will recognize from 'titanic' (although my favorite of his roles is jack the ripper in 'time after time') and lance henriksen, who many will remember as bishop in 'aliens'. these two actors have done some excellent work in their long careers and made some very fine films.however, as impressive as this collection of actors is, their talent is never fully manifested on the screen. the writers of 'felony' spent a lot of money to assemble a dream-team cast and then missed their golden opportunity because of one important factor, the common denominator of all b-movies: a silly script.we start with a silly premise. the bad guys are caught on tape committing a gruesome murder and they relentlessly pursue the film crew in order to acquire the videotape and destroy the evidence. but honestly, why bother? in the time it takes them to track down the film crew, a thousand copies of that tape could be made and circulated to every law enforcement agency and media outlet. the criminals don't seem to realize how futile their effort is, and they talk as if stealing and destroying the one original videotape is going to solve the whole problem. silly...but i suppose if the bad guys were so logical there would be no movie.then there is the dialogue. it is at times silly, at times cliché, and at times unbelievable...everything you have come to expect from a b-movie. of course, i have always believed that strong performances can overcome a lot of weaknesses in the material. this cast includes actors who are definitely capable of strong performances, and although a number of the cast members are not good actors at all and have achieved b-movie status quite deservedly, one still might be hopeful that the stronger part of the cast would be able to infuse some life into their parts. however, it's disappointing to see that few of the actors in this film really seem to take the movie seriously enough to give it their best shot. there's not much inspiration evident in these performances, but then again it's an uninspiring script. now, i'll admit that some of the more colorful actors in the cast do manage to add a certain amount of pizazz into the delivery of their lines, but honestly, even the very fine actors i mentioned earlier seem mostly disinterested and uninvolved with the story.speaking of the story...even if the acting had been of a high enough caliber that it made the dialogue seem a little less cheesy, it still would not redeem 'felony' from the fact that its writer commits the ultimate faux pas of low budget action movie scripts: a plot with as many holes as a block of swiss cheese. you can watch this movie a hundred times and you still won't figure out how everything adds up. in an effort to create suspense and always keep the viewer guessing, the writer throws in all kinds of surprises and unexpected twists into his script and ends up with a jigsaw puzzle, but when you get to the end you find there are a bunch of pieces that just don't fit anywhere and others that are missing. i admire a good thriller that keeps me guessing, but creating plot twists that exist just to confuse you and which are not consistent with the rest of the story is amateurish. there was so much that was never explained that i felt extremely frustrated at the end. if you decide to watch it, be prepared to be confused.i haven't even mentioned all kinds of other silly things about this movie, but i won't bother. the funny thing is that despite everything i've said, i have to admit that i can't give 'felony' 1/10 stars. although i can't exactly put my finger on why, i actually found this film to be somewhat likable. the silliness can actually be fun at times if you are in the mood for it. plus, i really like some of these character actors, and even though their performances are somewhat lackluster considering their talents, i still got a kick out of seeing them.now, i realize i have been rating this film from the standpoint of a serious moviegoer. it's entirely possible i have completely missed the point. it could be that the filmmakers' intention all along was to make a b-movie. maybe the silliness is all completely intentional. if that's the case, and if i were to rate it on those terms, i would have to say that 'felony' is a classic in the genre of tongue-in-cheek action flicks. b-movie fans will love seeing all of their favorite actors together in one film, will get some chuckles from the script, and will be entertained by the healthy dose of guns, explosions, and chases.

lance henriksen has a knack for being the top name in a b-movie, even in this case starring along side charles napier, master control program, and joe don baker. as always he does a great job of being the bad guy, but the plot is just bad (don't even get me started about the ending). and the editing is so horrible it might actually be a thing of beauty. is it just me, or does it seem that joe don baker was spliced into the movie at the last minute? also, anytime glass is broken in this movie, the editing is so anti-phenomenal. lastly, after watching this, i figure david warner is dying for tron 2.0 to finally get the green light.unfortunately for felony, this will be the third movie i give the rating of 1/10, joining iron eagle iv and no mercy.

one of the worst things a film studio can do is exploit the tragedies of others, commercializing a 'shock' or 'gore' factor in order to sell tickets to be able to buy their birch a new diamond necklace. another worst thing is to totally misrepresent the true facts of an incredible saga by fabricating events, dialog and images to the director's own liking. lastly, one of the worst things a film studio can do is to use bottom-of-the-barrel actors and shoot it all on a sound stage that was rented for fifty cents a day. all three of these travesties the makers of this film are guilty of. this is, hands-down, the worst movie i have ever seen, and i've seen thousands. a score of '1' is too good for this waste of celluloid. not only should the filmmakers be ashamed for making it, they should be ashamed for negatively exploiting the heroes of this story, which are the people who experienced this tragedy firsthand, both the living and the dead.

i couldn't. i was bored, not just because the acting was terrible and the tragic story was simply a b-movie whose plot was all about the cannibalism, but the fact i was watching a subtitle foreign film, which doesn't bother me at all, but was still dubbed.the "special effects" were awful. as the back of the plane splits off, you can see the model is hollow as it "breaks away" in the phony snow. most of the movie takes place on a sound stage that clearly is not real and almost looks like a play, as the "sounds" of snow blowing all over are heard but not actually scene."but how what will they eat? they have no food" one military person (it's never clear what this guy does or why he's in charge) says, which i'm sure no one ever said in reality or even thought about food, since they were concerned if the people were alive, not how they'd eat. it was simply a stupid line written to point out that, yes, they will have to eat the dead bodies to survive.when they finally decide to eat the bodies, one man finds one shirtless body, who despite being in the snow for however long, is not remotely frozen, in fact, his flesh is very flexible and fresh. he cuts the fresh meat off his back, that again, is not frozen or even cold it appears, and this scene goes on for five minutes. that's where i had to stop. the remake "alive" was a far superior film about trying to survive in a horrible situation that i'm sure the real survivors praised whereas i can't imagine any of them had anything nice to say about this version. it was simply about eating dead bodies and everything else was secondary. avoid.

making a film based on a true story, particularly one as incredible and horrifying as the 1972 andean plane crash, is hard for even the best filmmakers. but the mexicans behind this forgettable and cheap exploitation flick don't even try! the actual names of both the survivors and the casualties of the uruguayan air force plane crash have all been altered, the crash itself is obviously staged in a very slip-shod manner, and the cannibalism aspect has been unnecessarily and gorily played up. shockingly, it made a ton of money on both sides of the border. thankfully, thought, it has mercifully been forgotten. but the same people behind this would later give us the equally revolting guyana: cult of the damned!this cheap horror exploitation flick necessitated the making of alive some fifteen years later. that film was a masterpiece. survive!, to put it mildly, is not.

leave ed wood alone. to call "plan 9 from outer space" the worst film ever made would be to deny this abysmally vulgar heap of hollywood guano its rightful title. this pretentious fusion of witless whimsy and bathetic sociopolitical "commentary" actually does seem to be formed along the lines of "plan 9," with badly-staged scenes of down-on-their-luck actors on cheap sets interspersed with what appears to be footage of battle and crowd scenes cribbed from higher-budget epics. but whereas "plan 9" occasionally manages to be funny when it means to be and reasonably entertaining overall, this tacky pageant is appallingly lacking in basic showmanship, with scenes ranging from offensively unfunny (the disgusting burlesque of groucho marx stealing manhattan from the indians) to low camp (hedy lamarr attempting to impersonate joan of arc hearing her "voices") to tedious (dennis hopper doing absolutely nothing with the role of napoleon) to the unexpectedly poignant performance of peter lorre as the psychotic nero. give the worst director trophy to irwin allen, for turning so much into so little.

i'm an atheist. to me history and truth mean a lot.this film is made after a novel published in 1921, which is still being updated up to this day as if it was a history book. well it's not. the movie is about the novels 1950s version. some actors were great but that doesn't cover the plot.in short man invents a super-bomb so god and his friends hold a tribunal to see if they must intervene. the devil analogy persecutes man, and for defense we have the spirit of man. what is the spirit of man anyway? and why was the first defendant adam? eventually you just get us christian propaganda in a 5th grade history book of the time. though other religions are mentioned, only european christianity is explored.first we get the caveman story. the women are scrawny stereotypes of damsels in distress. real cave women were as strong as men and just as resistant. hard times, hard life, adapt and survive. all this is watered down by mid-century stereotypes.next we get egypt's first pyramid construction. today we see a different story and know that there were a lot less deaths and regular citizens at work as well. loosing mentioned amount of many lives in the process would have been a national disaster and nobody after would try to beat it. as if there was only one pyramid build.the part about moses and one true god was as if the spanish inquisition was asking nicely. inquisition itself was never even mentioned in the movie.helen of troy's evil grim was so vile that i didn't see why so many were even interested in her. in reality they were just soldiers, following commanders orders, who were "discussing" a political issue of power. she was just an excuse.the cleopatra story was were i saw this film was to inaccurate and filled with propaganda. here brother was a lot younger. she was not obsessed with poison, was quite educated to restore library content, and was politically competitive to drag beaten down egypt out of dirt.the part with nero and praying christians in a cave were disgusting. yes, rome burned down. yes, there was persecuted christianity. but the way they portray it was as if the coliseum build itself and there was no vespasian to rebuild rome.attila the hun appears in a short seen and than we jump to king arthur. the crusades are mentioned with minimal bloodshed. and there is no mention of the crusades east to russia that ended in an ironic battle. the knights just went home and started jousting for fun of it. a lot of stuff is put down like no indoor pluming, hygiene and plagues.then they cover joan of ark, where she always has to much makeup and looks like a princes. territorial politics were replaced with an unjust court. the sidesaddle alone on a stool makes me want to ask how someone could follow here. at here burning i wanted to yell "hura! now die already! cheap special effects, where is the fire?".by the time they mentioned leonardo i already got fed up with the movie. columbus, spanish slaughter of america, yelling queen elisabeth "kick the spanish armada" and so on and so on.the only reason i wanted to see this movie was the fact that it was the last one with all 3 marks brothers. and all they got was the scene with manhattan and indians. amusing, but no more than a smile.the witch-hunts are mentioned briefly, as well as plagues (after renascence). when they start portraying revolutions, things gut power-hungry and anarchistic. the us revolution was pursued by the french revolution. oppression and incompetence are bad, but you can't just blow the old way up out of anger, you must replace it with something. so they replaced the french monarchy with new french monarchy. so we get napoleon and his ambitions to go to india by land. but they replace his motives with unity and band him for only the title "emperor". the conquests in europe, defeat in russia are sacked to waterloo.the us civil war, the english rich inventors (tesla not included). "mister watson, come here, i want you" almost made me laugh for teenage reasons. technological hard work was watered down to the final discovery and comedic misuse.eventually after 85 minutes we come to world wars and organized crime, but none of its horrors. adolph's words "i invade russia. this is my last territorial demand" were hilarious. it was his last territorial demand.to build suspense god puts a countdown clock to doomsday on the "wall" for the final words. all mighty cant pause the universe for a second? there was no need for the persecution speech but the defense made one last throw.last we see the man of tomorrow as the final defense. apparently a paradox man, because the bomb was to go of today. his toys are a music box in the shape of a gun and a pencil box sword. now that is so wrong pens and pencils drew so many weapon blueprints that its kill count surpasses the atom bomb. and making music out of a weapon? deluded egoistic generals make music out of weapon fire. so the man of tomorrow is already a monster.the way i see it, all the defense had to do was blame the devil as the true conspirator for mans demise and case closed. and honestly, compared to all barbaric stuff our ancestors did centuries ago we are pretty humane at painless backstabbing these days.to summarize all i will just quote "firefly"s episode "jaynestown": "it's my estimation that every man ever got a statue made of him was one kind of son of bitch or another. ain't about you, jayne. it's about what they need".

i can't understand why many seem to hate this.this movie ties together many of the overlapping settings of the historical and biblical epics of the fifties, using set pieces, props, and costumes similar to those seen in other movies. here, however, the story attempts to run through all of human history, with a frame story about the human race being on trial, with a guilty verdict meaning h-bombs will go off all over the world. the prosecutor is the devil, played with fiendish glee by vincent price. ok, so it's a little hokey calling the defender "the spirit of all men," but i think that's one of the things that gives this movie a sense of period charm. the spririt of man is incidentally played quite well by ronald coleman, in his last film. it is also the last movie in which groucho, harpo, and chico marx all appear, but not together. groucho plays peiter minuet buying manhattan from the indians, in a scene played purely for campy humor. chico isn't funny at all as a monk who thinks the world is flat, and harpo, we are told, is meant to be isaac newton, discovering gravity. most of the other performances are well done, though.other hokey things are that the trial is supposedly taking place in outer space, which is depicted as a region of clouds and blueness. there is something called "the great clock of outer space," which, when striking midnight, may signal the end of the world.but at its heart, the movie addresses the problems of wmds and the eternal question of whether man is basically good, or basically evil; and poses it in what i think is an interesting way. also, anyone who likes the look of costume epics of the fifties should like the look of this movie.

when i was 8 years old, and going through my marx brothers phase, my father read in the tv guide that they were showing the marx brothers film, "the big store" late on friday night, and set the vcr to tape it for me. when i woke up on saturday -- due no doubt to a misprint in the tv guide -- my father and i discovered "the story of mankind" had been recorded instead."the big store" was probably one of the least funny of all the marx brothers movies and nevertheless it stands as one of the century's finest works of cinema when compared with "the story of mankind." i can almost justify tv guide's error, in that the marx brothers -- groucho, chico, and harpo -- appear in both movies. although in "the story of mankind," they are divided up into a series of unrelated scenes: groucho plays peter minuit, chico plays some guy talking to christopher columbus, and harpo plays isaac newton????? harpo's scene lasts about half a minute; chico only has two or three lines; groucho's scene is at least funny, but horribly racially insensitive by today's standards. the rest of the movie doesn't bear mentioning. they trotted out some of the finest actors of the day, and made them recite total garbage. what a disappointment.tv guide, i sent you a nice letter, i'm still waiting for an apology.for the record: "the big store" has a wonderful bit of physical comedy with the marx brothers on roller skates, and a couple of songs by virginia o'brien. i was really looking forward to seeing it.

irwin allen's first venture into all star spectacle was one all star disaster. the story of mankind contains some of the most incredible casting decisions of all time. virginia mayo as the blond cleopatra, dennis hopper chewing the scenery with napoleon, peter lorre dining on the scenery for weeks as nero, marie wilson as marie antoinette as a roadshow marilyn monroe, that's just some of them.the film also is known for being the last film which featured all three of the marx brothers though they all have different roles. chico plays a monk who is christopher columbus's confidante, groucho euchres the indians out of manhattan island as peter minuit, and most astonishing of all, harpo marx as sir isaac newton who discovers gravity when an apple conks him on the bean. holding all these portrayals together is a story where mankind itself is being judged. a super h bomb is about to be discovered and let loose will do in the world's population. it's judgement day a coming.but mankind has its advocates and detractors. speaking for the prosecution is old scratch who's been bringing the worst out in man for centuries in the form of vincent price. but man has his good side as well and who better than ronald colman to demonstrate man at his most civilized best. colman and price plead their case before the judge played by cedric hardwicke. in those three individuals you have some of the finest speaking voices the english language ever knew. when the film is on them as they each bring out the exhibits for their case it's a pleasure to listen to. then when the focus is on the individual stories, you want to scream in agony.what was irwin allen driving at, i'm still trying to figure it out. was he deliberately camping it up with some of these casting decisions? if it was satire, it just doesn't get off the ground.this was ronald colman's farewell film and while it's hardly something i'd like to go out on, i can't think of any man who could have stated the case for civilization any better. so when you see the story of mankind, fast forward through some of the exhibits and treasure every moment the advocates are before the judge.

pretty, stereotyped, good looking cast, the story loops in a wide and confusing arc, leading you down a number of garden paths (without attendant fairies) before plummeting to an end that feels you leaving - hollow.if you are after a film that has climax or ends with a satisfying thump, this is going to be a disappointment. inspite of the main character's notionally overt sexuality i felt that he was androgynous, lacking a clear male persona, rather like his lacking of a clear french persona. even though he is notionally laid naked (or rather sat naked) at the end of the film, the viewer is as unaware as the character as to motivations - that little thing called plot. probably a stereotypically english speaking point of view, at least if you take the side of the film.

l'auberge espagnole is less funny and less interesting than any episode of dobie gillis. where is their bob denver? do they even have a dwayne hickman? a french man moves to barcelona to attend classes. he moves in with some other students who are no more interesting than himself, and they do and say uninteresting things. this movie is unbelievably bland. the only bright spot was a pretty french girl who played a belgian lesbian. she places her hands behind her head and reveals shaven underarms, not the usual tufts of dark, smelly hair. but bare armpits does not a good movie make. l'emmerdeur was funny, so was la cage aux folles. l'auberge espagnole and le placard makes you wonder what is going wrong with french comedy.

i have seen previous movies from cédric klapisch, and therefore expected a quality movie with psychological depth. having been an erasmus student myself and having visited several friends studying abroad, i know very well what it means to spend some time abroad and mix with different cultures at the same time. yes, it is great fun! because of that i thought i should not miss this movie. unfortunately i was disappointed to find that l'auberge espagnol fails to satisfy in many ways: the characters are stereotyped, the events are trite and the story is shallow. although there are quite a few familiar situations, they are irritatingly cliché and do not go beyond the trivial events. this made the movie uninteresting to watch, and gave me a strong "been-there-done-that-don't-you-have-anything-to-add?" feeling. apart from that, the movie lacks a firm story. it sometimes looks more like a documentary or 'real-life' show than a seriously made movie.however, i can imagine that if you haven't studied or travelled abroad, this might be fun to watch.

kk should stick to singing- this whole movie was a big bore. i can't understand the viciousness of the boys and the romance between miles and kk- the sex scenes were uninspired too. the ending was awful- unresolved- there needs to be reason to murder. and the whole voyeurism of the boy was weird..... the mother always wrestled with the boy- don't you think he would get some rather freudian with her? and why didn't someone teach kk how to speak with inflection instead of monotone?glad i only paid $1.00 to rent this. 

the movie is an adaptation of a japanese story by the respected author yukio mishima. it simply doesn't make the transition into a credible story about brits and americans.the story moves sluggishly, especially the part where miles and kristofferson are separated and the director fills in with the cliched shots of a ship's prow cutting through the waves, and the little route line filling in on the maps, while their letters are heard in overvoice. the film moves so languidly that i even fast-forwarded through the sex and masturbation scenes which, although long, are not really either passionate or erotic. the film did achieve a measure of notoriety when kristofferson's then-wife divorced him for extra-curricular activities with miss miles during the filming. i guess they enjoyed the sex scenes, but it isn't quite the same for a viewer.there are no characters to hang on to. the sexually frustrated widow is unlikeable, the little kid is detestable. kristofferson is amiable enough, but he just doesn't have the acting skills to bring much to the role, although perhaps we don't really want get too involved with him, considering his ultimate fate.as for the little kid, well, he kinda falls in with a bad crowd after his dad dies, and they help him plot some evil against the man who enters his mum's life. now this is a really bad crowd. they don't just shoplift and smoke dope, nosireebib. they slip a mickey to a cat and vivisect it. this is shown in gory detail. but of course, this is only practice so they can do the same thing to kristofferson!so the movie mostly moves slowly, with no characters to relate to, and when something does happen it is unrelentingly morbid.the ending is about as unsatisfying as any movie you'll ever see.this all might have made some sense if the japanese locale and cultural context had been retained. as it stands, it is just abysmal.

distasteful british film from a japanese novel about a very troubled young man who comes under the influence of a hitler-like classmate and plots to harm his widowed mother's lover. a couple of good scenes (sarah miles discovering her son has been peeping at her and confronts him in anger, the pasty-faced lad trying to ensnare kris kristofferson to his demise by being extra friendly), but what's the point beyond provoking shock? ugly and uneasy, it doesn't showcase anyone involved to any advantage (especially kristofferson, whose hollow stares and usual gravelly talk is out-of-place in a psychological mishmash like this one). coldly without any sense of its own absurdity, director lewis john carlino seems to believe a circumstance like this could actually happen. if he's right, that's far more shocking than anything in "sailor". * from ****

1st watched 1/1/2003 - 3 out of 10(dir-henri verneuil): sober drama about a well-to-do doctor who gets into trouble carrying on a relationship with a younger woman, whom his family brings in to live with them, as well as being married to another in the same household. his searching for happiness is not clear, but they do bring out the reason for his unhappiness rather well by displaying the overbearing trait of the females in his wife's line. well played, but predictable drama.

like i'm sure other people have said this guy isn't a very worthwhile subject. sure, our society has a morbid fascination with death, and it's funny hearing him talk about how much he smokes and how much coffee he drinks, but he's into giving himself an unworthy mystique. anyway, the bottom line is that he's a moron racist using feeble methods to try to disprove the mountain of evidence of the holocaust, and as such he should be forgotten by time. but morris is in love with any kind of curiosities, which normally i wouldn't fault him for.

i was really looking forward to seeing this movie, having spent a few (fantastic) college weeks in barcelona myself. the premise is right on cue--a confused & disordered young individual enters a world of equally confused & disordered young individuals. but the director's weak swats at symbolism, philosophy and social commentary were completely off the mark, and it leaves us, the audience, feeling confused & disordered. bravo.perhaps if this movie had been presented as a european "american pie" flick, then i'd be able to turn off my brain and go along for the ride. but right off the bat, the director piques our deeper senses by introducing the symbolism of the twisted highways and the dichotomy of the "inner self" vs. the "public self" (one's "mother tongue" vs. one's "secondary language"). furthermore, it dives boldly into the subject of racial/national stereotyping. off to an interesting start, eh?wrong. that's as far as it goes. these interesting topics are hardly mentioned again except at the contrived epilogue-type ending which seemed to be the director's way of floundering to get back on topic. it reminded me of a meandering speech which goes nowhere, but the speaker ends by saying, "so in conclusion, i hope you see how this relates to my original thought!"furthermore, as other reviewers have pointed out, the cynical jab at stereotyping betrays itself. if the point is to ridicule the use of national stereotypes, then why did the director introduce a cockney-speaking, beer-swilling english brat as a caricature of prejudice? why did the director portray the american as a neanderthal (literally banging his chest & making ape noises at one point) whilst the europeans tolerate him superciliously? why is the british girl the one who sinks to uttering slurs (calling french people "frogs" and butchering the french language) while everyone else is above all that? the answer is that this isn't a deep or well-thought out film. it's simply an anglophobe's retort to the anglophiles. but really it's no different from the prejudice it seeks to ridicule! now there's a funny irony to consider.ok, philosophy, artistry & socio-political commentary aside, i was still very bored by this movie. there is one very funny gag which involves deceiving one of the girls' boyfriends, but aside from that i was hardly entertained at all. the only reason why i watched it through to the end is that i'd like to brush up on my french & spanish. (you see, we monolingual americans may be stupid, but we do try.)

not a terrible movie... but there are monster scenes where you will be rolling on the floor laughing - not a good thing for a action/thriller. the acting is generally pretty decent for a scifi channel movie. barry corbin plays a credible us senator, and lou diamond phillips again gives us a decent military/police/sheriff/agent/marshal figure. the special effects are well, "special" - for example, the external train shots are very obviously a model train.goofs: a meteor strikes a stationary car in the opening scene. the car bursts into flames but does not budge an inch. after the impact, the meteor is lodged in the top of the car's hood - impossible from the low angle that the meteor came in at.spoilers...a good portion of the movie's events are predictable, from the helicopter crash ("pull up, pull up!"), to the fact that the annoying people get it in the end, to the classic blown bridge over a 1000 foot gorge awaiting the train, to the sequel set-up at the end.the scenes showing the aliens attacking are hilarious. they are vicious cute puppets and move at lightening speed - remember the monty python rabbit? spoiler goof: in one scene four people shooting clip after clip cannot hit a single creature because they move at lightning speed. later in the movie todd bridges rigs up a mini flame thrower which he uses to dispatch a number of creatures at close range. on several occasions, lou diamond phillips is able to easily grab creatures with his bare hands.

i did my best to watch this two hour fiasco. it combined the awful special effects and plot of the original "blob," with an execrable boosting of the (outstanding in the original) screenplay of "runaway train." the only explanation for this movie is that someone needed to take a huge tax deduction and figured they'd combine it with a shot at hosting a casting couch. what an incredible stinker! lou diamond phillips is anxious to show us why he will take any part, no matter how bad. barry corbin continues his career as a typecast creep, a u.s. senator from texas and plays it well. he should next do the lead role in the story of trent lott or jesse helms. the women in this flick all seem to have gotten their roles as consolation prizes in the fay wray memorial screaming contest. special effects are unbelievably bad. h.s. kids in film class in north dakota could have done a better job. the writers must have pulled a heist at the cliché bank to accumulate this many. i couldn't watch any more without being forced to sit in the clockwork orange chair. i have no idea how it ended, except obviously, 119 minutes too late. ugh! caveat emptor.

we all know that special effects cost money, but it seems as if they could have used the money they saved writing the script to get some better shots. the train is obviously a model in most moving shots, the helicopter is obviously computer generated, the alien looks like the one from the end of spaceballs, except it's a decade later and spaceballs had an excuse.the only smart thing they did was blur all of the special effects to make them harder to see.not even the actors could compensate for such a poorly written script and it's pretty obvious they didn't really try either.please, don't waste your time. please.

this isn't a bad movie. it's fun to watch for the first time. however it has absolutely no replay value at all. when you try to watch it again it gets so boring you have to turn it off. i give this movie a 6 out of 10.

disappointing comedy-drama with sentimental coating has michael j. fox ideally cast as a former child star who now runs a talent agency for thespian tots; nathan lane and cyndi lauper are his assistants. this all sounds as if it can't miss, however too much of the scenario is given over to strident christina vidal as a streetwise tyke whom fox believes will be the next big thing. they lock quickly lock heads, and the bantering dialogue takes them back and forth to an uninteresting, formula finish. fox and lane are both appealing, but the energy of the early scenes gives way to treacle. slickly produced, but ultimately stale. *1/2 from ****

*this review may contain spoilers... or maybe not. the warning is the same for all*dang it. just when i thought that scifi channel had used all of its ridiculous ideas for movies, they give us this. actually, the plot itself it's nothing we haven't seen in movies like snakes on a plane, deep blue sea, etc... that means, a monster/animal/menace of some kind is lurking in a close environment threatening a bunch of people. in this case, an alien in a train. wow.i must say that, when i first saw this thing on cable, i couldn't stop laughing. no scifi film had prepared me for this; it was so incredibly pathetic i couldn't believe it! the actors are all a bunch of stereotypical-genre characters. but since they're not so famous (to say the least), i wasn't expecting much of them. except diamond phillips. no comments there, but i think the guy was desperate to find a job. the problem was something called 'special effects', horrible even for scifi channel standards. that model/toy they made us believe it was a real train (not to mention the model/toy helicopter, bigger than a train's wagon), the meteor coming horizontally from space, the 'baby' alien (a sock puppet, and i ain't kiddin'), the regular aliens who looked pretty ugly... while they were static; when they started "moving", it was awful, the explosions (the terrorist blew up literally! and what about the exploding helicopter! just how many barrels of gas was that thing carrying?), the insane mathematics used (they couldn't even solve a school problem right!)... and i won't talk about that doomsday-like ending, by that time i didn't know if to keep laughing or to start crying. if i remember right, i did both.it's an ideal movie to have a good laugh, alone or with friends. but be warned; it's so ridiculous at so many levels... and you need a heck of a lot of suspension of disbelief...

it is sad to have to say that a film is truly awful and one tries to find ways around saying this. however, this is a dreadful film. gene hackman wastes time (and one suspects, many dollars) on re-playing his most famous, and oft recreated, role as "gene hackman". otherwise, television actors are given the chance to become film stars, and successfully, resist the temptation. patrick swayze has a minor part and went on to greater things, for which he must be eternally thankful.i watched this film, as a result of someone else's review and i felt that another point of view was merited. you may not agree with my review but now, at least, you have been warned.

maybe our standards for vientam movies have increased since born on the fourth of july, full metal jacket, and platoon. this movie has a predictable plot, bad writing, bad acting, bad directing, bad special effects, etc. compared with other vietnam movies this one is completely unbelievable.

but to be a little more precise i do not think that it is as bad as it actually could be. eventhough the actors (famous to semi-famous) didn't do a very great job. directors fault? could be the script as well hard for me to say? anyway, if you are after a lot of cool guns and action this is not the movie for you but they do run around with a lot of ww2 vintage guns. sort of fun :) well i guess i could say more but it just doesn't feel as if it's worth it. if you are desperate enough or a hackman freak see it otherwise don't!live well and prosper

i know these types of films sell tickets and make a profit for the film makers but it just won't do as a film about vietnam. viet nam was filled with horrors for the men who lived it day in and day out.this film stars gene hackman who is korean war vet assigned to train a group of rag-tag viet nam vets for a return trip to that country to rescue a group of american pow's held at a camp there. these men include a former tunnel rat, a crazy acid dropping sailor, a blond tanned surfer from california and some inexperienced kid (patrick swayze) who just so happens had a dad that was killed in nam. they train first at some camp in texas and once in nam they are found out and lose all their weapons. they are able to find replacement weapons and continue on their way to free the captured men. most of the men are found and saved but the rag-tag group is mostly wiped out.this movie played like a video game in which you could figure out what was going to happen next and who would pop out of behind what bush, and who was going to die and who was going to live. viet nam i'm guessing was not like a video game....

gene hackman is a former marine corps colonel who musters a handful of private vietnam vets to go back to laos and rescue some americans who have been listed as missing in action. hackman suspects that, in actuality, the half-dozen or so mias are secretly being held in a remote camp by laotians to be tormented and to provide more hard labor. hackman is being paid by the wealthy robert stack, whose son, like hackman's son, is thought to be among the mias. but the circumstances are such that hackman can only manage to buy old and out-dated weapons, though he manages to pick up the help of a fervid anti-communist loatian and his two daughters along the way.i don't think the movie was deliberately concocted to endorse the myth of the vietnames still holding our mias for propaganda purposes. the myth was real enough. if anyone remembers, there were many bumper stickers in 1982 and 1983, bring back the mias. i think, instead, that the film was made partly in order to cash in on the myth. it was absurd on the face of it. why would our former enemy refuse to return mias? propaganda? where is the propaganda value in something that's kept secret? to add the labor supply? they need a hundred extra laborers in vietnam and laos? the motives behind this movie -- with its triumphant music and high body count -- were scurrilous.but how about the movie itself? stripped of its theme of rescuing mythical mistreated mias, it's a routine paramilitary actioner, no better and no worse than dozens of others that appeared in the 1980s. gene hackman's performance is the only one that manages to keep its head above water. he's just about always reliable.of the others, this being a formulaic plot, derived from "the dirty dozen" among others, i kept trying to guess which of the gang would sacrifice themselves for the mission. of the three anti-communist asians, i figured one or more were dead meat. that's why asian helpers appear in movies like this. (i was right two times out of three.) i also figured patrick swayzie as the rookie ex-officer, the youngest of the group, who'd never "earned the respect" of the others because he'd never seen combat, would also have to go in some heroic mode. wrong. he becomes a hero, true, but survives intact. i thought there was a fifty-fifty chance that hackman would have to go too, but he makes it out okay. the formula doesn't really stretch for originality either. charles bronson's claustrophobic pow escapee from "the great escape" is here in fred ward's ex tunnel rat, a claustrophobe who is forced to crawl through a drainage pipe with a snake inside it, so that he can do a recon on the laotian pow camp.the title, "uncommon valor," is from a tribute that admiral nimitz made to the men on iwo jima -- "uncommon valor was common that day." nimitz was certainly right about that. whether or not the men who fought in vietnam were all equally valorous is remote from the point. anyone who saw combat or even came near it, putting their lives on the line for the guys in the line next to them, were heroic enough. this movie, and the way it exploits our bitterness about the vietnam war, doesn't really do them justice.

this pathetic excuse for a movie doesn't have a decent structure or a sensible closure. the characters were confusing and the entire plot kept getting off track. i'd have to say that pixel perfect was a disgrace. this is what happens when you let disney channel make movies.

i'm not sure who should be blamed for this debacle - in truth, the acting isn't too bad and the story isn't as terrible as some made-for-disney movies have been. the story itself is shallow and undeveloped but that isn't surprising in a film of this type. the acting is more than a bit two-dimensional, but i give the actors credit for managing to do anything with the material that they had to work with.however, it's inexcusable, in my book, to base an entire storyline on the theory that they've created a 'perfect' pop star and then cast an actress who can't sing to save her life. if the girl can't sing, have someone who can record the music!this actress is a terrible singer - she was so flat she was usually singing in a totally different key!

one of the worst movies i've ever seen. completely ridiculous. the story is bad. the animations are completely childish and displaced. the physics of the holograms are hilarious from how much they are completely wrong. omg, i even wanna believe that this film has disney label on it. yuck. the actresses are somewhat beautiful, but there are so many good films with astonishing actresses that are far more valuable to see than this one. final remark, bad film. don't bother to watch it. if you're looking for films to see with your kids consider other alternatives like ratattuile, monster inc or an enchanted story (on theaters). seriously.

bad, a lot a crap. it copied simone, also a bad movie! them flips when "loretta modern" sang was lame. that internet scenes made it worse. and roscoe loves a "hologram"! thats plain stupid! i give 0 stars! because they copied, the plot was stupid, the whole movie was thumbs down all the way!

last night, i got bored and decided to watch a movie called 'out kold' which i had once bought with a whole lot of other cheap movies from a videostore. seemed like a good old action movie, so i took out the chips and coke and was ready for a relaxing evening. well, the pain started right from the beginning. the main character is a boxer who is the nicest guy i have ever seen. as the good person he has to be nice of course, but he is just a pussy! that totally doesn't fit with a boxer that has 28 ko's and starts working for a pimp to earn some extra money. even nice guys can still be cool. well, then came his first fight while he was working for this pimp. every punch was clearly missed and that became even more annoying because the sound effect weren't synchronised with the punches. then there is this totally worthless acting of the whole cast, and you have enough reasons to leave this movie for what it is. i gave it a 1 because i have never seen such a bad movie.

watching alien express inspired feelings of awe, shock, pity and, yes, sheer terror. to think that actors who have done good work in the past should come to something like this. the horror, the horror.tell me if any of this sounds familiar.a train especially built for a political campaign is on it's way to las vegas for a big rally for the candidate, a senator from texas (barry corbin, the only actor with roles both alien express and no country for old men in the same decade). at a railroad crossing in utah a meteor incinerates a car waiting for the train to pass.the train stops. local law enforcement is summoned. oh, can it be? the senator has a lovely young lady (amy locane from cry-baby and melrose place) who just happened to have once been married to one of the officers answering the 911 call. lou diamond phillips (stand and deliver, la bamba) is the ex-husband.meanwhile eeeeevil aliens have managed to stow away on the train.the train leaves. lou gets his buddy to pilot a helicopter so that lou can drop onto the moving train (about 70 miles per hour) so that he can save the day. as the buddy's reward, he crashes the helicopter into the mountain.which is another example of how poorly written alien express is. the cop hero's sidekick must die, we all know that. but he's supposed to die near the end of the third act, usually while saving several lives.once on the train, lou manages to lose his shirt so that he can channel bruce willis in die hard by wearing a wife beater t-shirt. yeah, lou is 46 years old but he hits the gym. the part he's playing isn't worth bothering with, but he's in good shape.the senator is going to have an afternoon delight with miss utah, but aliens intercede and both he and the woman young enough to be his granddaughter pay the ultimate price.soon we have bomb threats, multiplying aliens, and of course the train goes out of control and speeds toward its date with destiny while lou and todd bridges (diff'rent strokes) try to save as many lives as they can.there is exactly one surprise in the entire movie. early in the story a couple lift wine glasses to their thirty-fifth anniversary, with hopes for thirty-five more years together. the dude gets banged up, but he and the mrs. both live. maybe the writers just lost track of them.this is the kind of movie that you'd love to be a fly on the wall. these actors who have done better work (and, really, deserve much better than this) are probably just happy for the work. did they actually think they were working on something worthwhile, or did they cry (and/or drink) themselves to sleep at night? at the end of the story the (fairly numerous, all things considered) survivors gather in the last car of the train, which is unhooked. the other cars go over a cliff but the one containing the protagonists stops just inches short of the cliff.lou and his ex are reunited. happiness reigns. i'd have thought that the first thing they'd do was get off the train so they'd have solid ground under their feet, but i digress.someone looks out the window and sees a shooting star. look, make a wish. then another. then more and more. the earth is being bombarded with meteors that will crack open and creepy crawly hand puppets with big teeth will be everywhere.it's gotten to a point that seeing the words "the sci-fi channel presents" on an "original" movie tells us that we'll be glad we have ti-vo so that we can fast forward through the next two hours. or, better yet, just go ahead and erase it two minutes into the story and spend that time more wisely.

if you would like to watch an example of how not to make a film, then you need to watch this. i, myself, with no film making experience could do better. the script is laughable with a weak plot and there is no effort to be seen for any intelligent structure. in order to make up for this flaw, you would think the action would be decent, wouldn't you?as the acting, editing and overall piecing together of the film is appalling the only saving grace is the dreadful performance by the lead actor. the reason why he is the saving grace, is because he is so genuinely bad at acting, that he should win an oscar for it. at least some recognition for making me laugh at him so much.toss in a dead woman's body after an all male shoot out (where did she come from?), pull the semi automatic trigger tens of times while the soundman pulls off two gunshot effects, reflection of the camera crew in kool mo dee's shades, one and only one music track for the whole film, an unoriginal script that has no logic; is a perfect recipe for a really, really bad film. its actually more fun spotting the errors than actually trying to find something positive. avoid at all costs.

i rented this movie from my local library and thought it might be good considering i like this type of movie and considering who was in it but boy was i wrong. the acting stunk, the fight scenes were just as bad and they got a couple of known people to be in it but didn't cast anyone with acting ability to play the lead? i noticed some people gave it a 10. why would you ever consider giving this pile of horse **** a 10. you can say it's worth a 10 for the sheer comedy of it but when you vote on a movie that's not supposed to be a comedy you can't give it a 10 for comedy. you have to rate it on what it was supposed to actually be like and not for something the director wasn't intending. maybe some of you voted 10 cause you thought it would be funny to have this crappy movie have a high rating so that people would go out and rent or buy it cause you think it's fun to mislead people. you're playing with peoples time and money which you have no right to do. if the movie sucked give it a bad rating if it was good give it a good rating but don't lie. i gave this movie a 4 and am glad that i was able to check this out for free from my library cause this movie sucked and really isn't worth paying a cent to see.

purchased this film for one dollar and figured i could never go wrong, my big mistake was watching it. enjoyed the acting of ice-t and the rapping which gave lots of class to this film about los angeles and the world of pimps. there is a boxer who kills one of his opponents in a practice ring and who has a career, but because of mental problems from childhood and the killing of this other boxer he retires. he gets hired by a pimp who is looking for a bodyguard to protect the girls that work for him at their trade and make sure they are not beaten up. this boxer falls in love with the boss's girlfriend and all kinds of trouble starts. this is entertaining and it then becomes a big laughing comedy.

wow, jeez, i don't even know where to begin commenting on this thing they called a movie. i seriously don't know what the hell david bradley began smoking after making hard justice, which in my opinion, was quite a good movie after the american ninja features. i hadn't seen any of this guy's latter movies after cyborg cop. lucky i saw them on amazon for like 5 pounds each and i can safely say the following: if i had thrown down the drain the 5 pounds i spent on total reality, crisis and expect to die, i would have ended up happier than having to sit through the 90 minutes that each of them lasted. my god, how the heck can anybody label these as "movies" ??? and why do action/martial arts actors fall knee-deep into the smelliest horse-dung when they've like reached their peak?? i mean, david bradley's no oscar deserver but his first movies were pretty entertaining. tough, cool guy with pretty good martial expertise who delivered corny lines but at least entertained action and martial arts fans to a certain extent. but i seriously would love to know what went through this guy's head after making hard justice. his final 3 movies have to frankly be the worst i have ever had to sit through. as i mentioned before, i'd love to get my money back on the 3 dvds i bought. crisis was the epitome of sleepiness, total reality was harsh but this expect to die is just utter nonsense. i bet the director was either mega-stoned when he made this or he was just taking the pee out of every david bradley fan who would sit through this heap of crap. the plot circles around a doctor (bradley) who develops some type of virtual reality game in which he's just killing different people off one by one. sorry but i just couldn't take this guy seriously playing a baddie with that posh hair-do, glasses and gray slacks and doing absolutely no physical fighting whatsoever (frankly, his best asset). the film is even worse than any of those saturday afternoon b-movies because the acting is laughable, the directing is horrendous and the few fights in the movie, well, what can i say... the actors look like they're training with their gym buddy. we get a dumb muscular cop who starts to show off his fighting stuff like one hour into the movie and fails heavily... a french hairy version of van damme who just can't fight, act or speak to save his freaking life and bradley, the supposed protagonist, playing the evil doctor who i was really happy for when he stopped making this type of expendable rubbish. i even reckon he didn't throw a kick in this movie probably due to his heart condition already playing up on him. for a b-actor, i must admit i really liked this guy, his style, physique, fighting skills... but i'm really, really glad he stopped acting after this monstrosity because i honestly wouldn't have been able to sit through another ninety minutes of pee-taking material like this one. avoid at all costs even if you're family of david bradley, you'll be glad you did, word.

they must be. i'll list them so that you can check them off one-by-one:- police regularly leave tens of millions of dollars of cash and drugs just lying around, because they don't have evidence facilities.- when you get shot, you always grunt the same way, and fly back the same way, even though there's never a mark on your body.- police are not able to identify the sound of gun shots, and don't think anything is suspicious when an undercover policewoman's phone call during a high-level drug-and-money deal is cut shot by that gun shot.- bad guy gunmen can hit mannequins with one shot, but can't hit a big, bulky martial artist with 100.- if you rocket launcher a car in a car park, the next three cars in a line will blow up evenly in 15 second intervals.- further to the last point, all the cheap cars are always parked next to each other.- the smoke that is caused from the firing of the rocket launcher is much greater than the amount of smoke caused by four cars blowing up.- virtual reality games that are a long, long way ahead of anything any other gaming company can produce fit on five floppy disks.- virtual reality games that are a long, long way ahead of anything any other gaming company can produce have graphics that look like windows 3.1 screen-savers.- floppy disks can be read even after they've been shot up.- semi-drunk guys in bars attentively watch the news when they're at the pub, and have a deep understanding of american modern military history, agent orange, and the family trees of high-ranking military officials. however, they're only able to articulate their points using dialogue that sounds silly coming from anyone over the age of seven.- even though fights appear to break out almost hourly in a bar, that bar has only one staff worker, who both pours the beers and handles security. of course he knows martial arts.- gold medal olympians regularly make the simple transition to corporate ceos of software companies in a matter of years.- a woman who works for a computer game company knows everything about how to beat a game she's never played, raves constantly about her competitor's great games, and can rattle off facts and figures regarding her company's rivals - but she didn't know that they overtook almost all the other companies in the field in large corporate mergers.- bad guys always die in slow motion. always.- wives tell their husbands that they're pregnant by raving about their man's bravery in killing bad guys.- wives do large amounts of their husband's police work; this might explain why she whines and complains so much every time he has to go to work. although, it doesn't explain why she adores him so much every time he gets up in the morning and she can read about his murderous escapades.- it's fairly typical for a police officer to be involved in kidnappings, kill tons of people on three separate occasions and stop a variety of multi-million dollar illegal deals in a week.- when trying to lose a car that's following you, it's wise to continue driving under the speed limit. and if you're following a cop, subtlety is not important - you can tailgate him for miles, then park right next to him. he won't notice.- all cops are experienced martial artists.- it is possible to kick a guy four metres in distance.- people scream or grunt in pain when they are punched or kick, yet when they have their arm broken, they don't make a sound.- bad guys clean their bloodied axes with their handkerchiefs, and then leave them in their pocket for many days.- pieces of wood, when swung with one sharp blow, shatter sturdy ladders in six or more places simultaneously.- the photo, and listed special features on the back of the dvd case don't necessarily have to be on the dvd. the advertised interactive menus? why not no menu at all! the advertised scene index? why not have the whole thing as one scene/chapter, and not need an index! likewise, it's ok to use the matrix's font and title in the tag-line, and not be a rip-off in any way.with all of this, i'm in shock that 12 out of the 15 top credited actors never acted again.

in the wake of the matrix this travesty of a film with loose connections to vr has been reissued with the tag-line "the matrix just got deadler!", in a box with a very matrix inspired cover (still called "expect to die" though). due to the choice of font however the tag-line looks to all the world like it says "beablier". anyway.to complete the transformation to matrix wannabe they have mocked up a vr fight scene with a morpheus-a-like on the back of the box. it may be important to know that this character does not feature in the film.overall this film is a travesty on every level. jalal mehri is an awful actor and does not impress with his martial arts. however his partner stone is played by evan lurie, who in this film is simply the worst actor i have ever seen. clearly he was chosen to make jalal look good in comparison. worst film i have seen for a long long time.

my first question, is not about the horrible acting, not about the horrendous writing, it is the directing. the choices that were made about the cinematography are some of this worst decisions i have ever seen. why does every single bad guy have to die in slow motion? i was about to beat myself with a rubber hose. the camera shots make it so that you can't see whats going on. i was just about to turn the movie off because of jalal merhi's accent, when it made it to the sex scene, so i thought it might get better, well it did not. if you rate special effects on an a,b,c rating scale, i would have to put it around a w or so, and did i mention the acting? wow, was it bad!!! and the worst part of the entire "expect to die" experience, is the blatant misuse of the phrase on the cover, which is: "the matrix just got deadlier". comparing this movie to the matrix is easily the worst comparison i have ever seen. if you haven't seen this movie, don't, unless you are looking for a good reason to beat your head against the wall.

as a fan of bad movies (and mst3k, and a member of mft3k), i must say i've seen my share of them. but geez! even the worst i've seen at least had a soundtrack. as george lazenby stiffly wanders around hong kong, doing who knows what, you can guarantee that you won't be distracted by any of that background music that fills todays cinema. or any of that music that fills elevators. i don't think anyone in this film even hums.now, this isn't entirely true -- there *is* a sound track. if you listen closely, you will hear it chime in about a half-dozen times through the course of the film. of course, the timing will be entirely inappropriate, and it doesn't last very long, but something that could be classified as "music" does occur. your best bet, though, is to sit your toddler armed with a wooden spoon down in front of the tv with a collection of pots and pans while you watch. the rhythm and flow would be better than anything the film offers.keep an eye out for sammo hung as a minor villian in this film. aren't we all glad he found jackie chan to work with?

*spoilers - sorry!* the first word that sprung to mind whilst watching the film is 'gremlins'. it's the only critters movie i have seen from the four movies, but i enjoyed it. it wasn't too complicated as i hadn't seen the past two, but i thought it was quite a good movie all the same. critters starts with a man, his son and daughter stopping off on the way to a vacation (although it turns out that they end up at their own home - which i have no idea what the hell went on) the girl meets up with a boy (played by leo dicaprio) and they go hang out in a nearby forest. they meet this weird guy who tells them to be careful and stuff because of the critters. he seems a bit psychotic and if i was in that situation, i would not speak to him. the critters steal a ride of the girl and boy's car and end up in their flat thing. they hide out in the basement and end up killing this lazy jerk. they then nearly kill this fat woman and the girl's dad. they are chased higher and higher up the flat until they hide in the attic. the critters eat stuff in the kitchen (spoof of the gremlins kitchen scene???!) and i can't remember (not a good thing) but i'm sure they have to go back for something/someone. anyway they end up getting out and saved. the psychotic guy comes back and before he kills the last two critters he is told he can't because they are endangered and so he sends them home.the ending was disappointing and i was annoyed that only the lazy guy died as there were quite a few annoying characters i would personally have killed off. it's a thrilling, exciting movie worth a watch. but, if you're looking for a better version of this genre i recommend the gremlins movies. sorry!

sadly, this movie is not very good. but does it really matter ? we all know the basics for the story, and this has nothing new. but i love low budget horror & sci fic camp classics ... so i forgive this one. about thew only thing that anyone remember from this movie, is that little leonardo dicaprio made his debut in it.he did ok. the part didn't ask for great acting skills, and the direction probably never gave him any chance of providing one anyway ... little leonardo dicaprio was very cute ... and so was the girl. the movie is fun, if you like horror & sci fic camp classics and are experienced in watching them.

it is way beyond me how this script was ever sold much less produced and distributed. the dialogue was so bad it was sickening. the train and helicopter scenes appeared to have been done on flash cards by high school students. lou diamond phillips must have hidden under his seat when this --- this "movie"? was shown at a private screening afterwhich he most likely left by the back door. the only emotion it aroused in me was pity for the cast, they had to "bite the bullet" to get through this one. i couldn't stand to watch all of it, it was so predictable that it was funny. who knows maybe it will be picked up by one of the networks as a situation comedy.

critters 3 starts on the open road as clifford (john calvin) his teenage daughter annie (aimee brooks) & his young son johnny (the imdb list two actor's christian & josephh cousins, identical twins perhaps?) are heading back home from a vacation. suddenly the tyre on their van blows & they have to stop at a public rest area to fix it. while there annie & johnny meet a kid named josh (leonardo dicaprio, yes that one) who in turn all run into charlie mcfadden (the films co-producer don keith opper) from the previous two critter films. charlie tells them the story of the critters & the town of grovers bend but they don't believe him. meanwhile back at the van a critter lays some eggs on it's underside, out of sight from everyone. once clifford has fixed the tyre the trio set off for their home, a run down urban tenement block in los angeles somewhere complete with critter eggs along for the ride. upon arrival the eggs hatch & the critters head straight inside the tenement block quickly disposing of frank (geoffrey blake), the caretaker. as the night draws on the few remaining residents, a fat woman named rosalie (diana bellamy), a telephone repair woman marsha (katherine cortez), an elderly couple mr. (bill zuckert) & mrs. menges (frances bay) must come together with clifford & his kids to fight the critters. josh also makes an appearance as his stepfather (william dennis hunt) owns the building. but will the group be able to defeat the critters & prevent themselves from becoming dinner?directed kristine peterson i thought critters 3 was an incredibly undistinguished film, but at least she can say she made a film staring leonardo dicaprio & not many people can say that! the budget for critters 3 probably wasn't exactly a fortune as the whole production looks cheap throughout, there are very few characters, very few critters & i think only 3 ever appear in the same shot at once & it does away with any sort of space angle so there are no expensive spaceship or distant alien planet special effects to pay for. the script by david j. schow is strictly by-the-numbers & very predictable. a group of humans are stuck in an isolated situation with critters & have no means of contacting the outside world for help, that plot scenario sounds very familiar right? well it's same as the previous critters (1986) & critters 2: the main course (1988) & many other horror films so it should. critters 3 does nothing with the premise, it never even tries to add anything to an already old, tired & well used storyline. critters 3 is also very tame for a horror film with only two people actually being killed, the comedy elements are seriously lacking as well with the best joke critters 3 can mange being a critter eating some beans & then farting, very funny if your about 5 years old. the characters are mostly standard horror film clichés & quickly became annoying. there is virtually no blood or gore in critters 3 at all, just a few splashes of blood & disappointingly critters 3 in fact seems to go out of it's way not to show any violence. the special effects on the critters are ok but they still look like static, simplistic hand-puppets that have very little movement. the acting isn't that good & critters 3 happens to be a certain leonardo dicaprio's very first feature film, to be fair to the kid he's alright & i wonder if any of the other cast or crew had an idea what he go on to become. why on earth does that charlie guy have to keep popping up in these critter films? to give critters 3 some credit it moves along at a good pace & isn't boring, it's generally well made with nice enough production values & it's a bit of harmless fun if your in the right sort of mood & thankfully it only lasts for about 80 odd minutes. overall critters 3 is an ok time waster but don't expect anything deep or meaningful. there's nothing really wrong with it as cheap horror film but i couldn't help feeling that i'd seen it all before. an average time-waster that isn't as good as either of the previous two critter films. critters 3 ends with a 'to be continued...' as this was filmed back to back with critters 4 (1991) which unsurprisingly went straight to video, probably to save even more money. critters 3 is a decent enough way to waste 80 odd minutes if you can watch it on t.v. for free otherwise don't bother.

basically the first two critters movie were already silly ones but in a good and entertaining way. this movie is way more of a b-movie, that is silly but for all of the wrong reasons.this is the first sequel that doesn't really follows the plot of the first two movies. basically all of the characters are new and there are no bounty hunters this time (well, as good as none, since the bounty hunter in this movie shows up far too late) and the budget for this one obviously went down again. to save even more costs, the movie got shot back-to-back with part 4, which i imaging will be just as bad, since it directly follows this movie and got made by the same people involved as with this one.it's just a typical b-genre movie, that doesn't really have any originality in it or brings entertainment. it makes "critters 3" a real redundant sequel, you can easily do without. granted that things could had been way worse for this movie but it just ain't exactly a good one either. the movie just falls flat as a science-fiction/horror/comedy.also kind of strange to notice how the critters has suddenly changed in this one. they are about double their usual size this time, without giving an explanation for that and they are even more gremlins like in this movie than was the case in the previous one.the movie is only made interesting because this was the feature film debut of leonardo dicaprio. he was about 17 in this movie and of course looking baby-faced like he still does now. i like watching this well known actors in their early roles. it's fun to see how they act and if their style has improved and changed over the years. of course dicaprio got only better but he already was kind of delivering his lines in the same way as he does these days.really a too silly and lame movie.4/10

well this was a complete waste of celluloid. the preview was promising but after watching the movie, it looked like the preview *was* the whole movie. no plot, no clear storyline, just some misplaced suspense. it looks like the director tried very hard to create an atmosphere of mystique and fear, but still there are gaps to be filled. why the drugs? why the number 11.11? (btw. as sarah enteres the library, the clock says 11.14) what's the connection to the murder on the parents? what's the role of this rayden woman? is she one of the children or not? who are those children anyway. there is a lot of material lying around to create the ultimate cult movie like "the omen" but the director just leaves them lying on the floor without digging into the story. even "the blairwitch project" was more scary than this one. all the gaps you hope to be filled like in "the butterfly effect" stay open as the credits start rolling.. ok. off to the next movie...

what can be said about such a pathetic movie ? - very bad acting ! the main actress seems to know only one facial expression : fear mixed with weakness. like a poor beaten dog... the other actress (the one who plays the evil) looks like the female double of ozzy osbourne, with an awful red wig. the other actors are so pitiful that they don't even worth being described. - there's absolutely no plot. the story begins with possibilities but goes nowhere : we don't know anything about the meaning of "11:11", nor who rayden really is, excepted the simple "she's evil" or "she's a child of apocalypse"... which is not an explanation. we don't know why the parents have been killed, what kind of danger is growing and why sara was chosen. as the film goes on, we just watch pseudo-scary scenes, with a bad music. moreover, the end doesn't tell anything : we just see two possibilities as if one of them was a bonus scene or the director's cut... there's no plot, so no possible interpretation. - "11:11" is just full of clichés ! it is so obvious that i couldn't help laughing. for example : the deserted library or the bathroom scenes, ghost silhouettes walking with a blast of wind, ... there's even the fashionable "little scary girl" as in "dark water" or "the ring". of course, the main character is bullied at school and looks like a stereotyped gothic girl (dark hair, red lips, skinny, black clothes). is it an obligation to make her credible ? i don't think so. the psychology of sara is so few developed and so typical that it doesn't make her credible, nor endearing.- terrible direction : as i said, nothing original, everything has already been seen a thousand times and is used here without any real purpose. - there are some funny incoherences. for example, i don't know if "ghost science", "paranormal course" or whatever is taught in american universities... in europe it is really not the case : teachers talking about negative energies or using "unmaterial" creatures sensors... ridiculous. also : how can you watch a movie shot in the sixties with a super-8 camera on a computer screen without spending hours of your time for a digitalization (in the movie they watch it immediately on the computer screen) and how can you, on this old film, isolate a tiny detail then zoom in and see a perfectly identifiable face ? i wonder if the director has ever tried to digitize an old analogical film...eventually, "11:11" just worths being watched if you like to laugh at silly movies, or maybe if you want to fall asleep on your couch... but it's an expensive way to fall asleep !

first of all, this movie is so confused that it is almost impossible to summarize it, since i myself did not understand this horrible story. further, the unknown cast, leaded by an actress called laura mennell, is simply awful. the expressions and screams of the character sara tobias are laughable and ridiculous, confusing grimaces with acting. last but not the least, there are many favorable reviews about this flick in imdb as follows:- top notch- can't wait to see more of the directors work  the author has only one review in imdb on 24 september 2004;- incredibly shot, amazingly intense  the author has only one review in imdb on 12 august 2004; - not your typical blood and gore, in fact better. 7/10  the author has only one review in imdb on 13 february 2005;- as intense as asian horror!! - the author has only one review in imdb on 14 november 2004.coincidence? or are they the parents, relatives, friends or people hired by the production to promote this crap? my vote is three.title (brazil): "11.11  a nova profecia" ("11.11  the new prophecy")

11:11 a.k.a. hell's gate (2004) is another bad horror movie that tries too hard to be something it's not. a young girl has an imaginary play mate. one day whilst out in the fields playing with her friends, a couple of fugitives visit her parents and whack them off for no apparent reason. the young girl runs off and hides from the bad men. years later, the girl grows up into a woman with problems. losers at her school (looking like repressed homosexuals) flaunt their manhood in front of her when she rejected one of them. the girls hate her and life in general is miserable for her. a secret from her past returns to visit her. who or what is it? why does everyone hate her? what's her guardian's problem with her? to find out you'll have to watch hell's gate.the new title makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. i don't know why people are given money to make such bad movies. this film is not even good enough to make fun of. it's a head ache inducing mess that'l confuse anyone who tries to make some sense out of it. not worth your time.not recommended.

porn legend gregory dark directs this cheesy horror flick that has glen jacobs (kane from wwf/wwe/ whatever it calls itself nowadays) in his cinematic debut. he plays jacob goodknight, a blind serial killer who's forte is taking people's eyes out. the plot, be it as it may, has a group of troubled youths cleaning up the historical hotel that goodknight resides in and subsequently being offed by him. hemmingway it's not. starts of as fun dopey b-movie, but soon gets too tedious to be enjoyable. glad i went in with pretty low expectations, but even those weren't met. how can you have a porn king directing and still suffer from a lack of nudity??? for shame.my grade: d- eye candy: samantha noble bares her ass briefly

ok, lets start with the best. the building. although hard to believe it had electricity and running water after 35 years and a fire, the gruesome walls and odd items found throughout were interesting. other than that, its not worth it.as far as the bad, its done by wwe films. wtf? is that supposed to make you want to see it? if anything, stay away. horrible, horrible idea for them to make movies and allow gregory dark to direct it. bad choice. the previews beforehand were more interesting and entertaining.i cant even begin to discuss how bad this film is. untalented actors & a disappointing, vague storyline. apparently many of the actors are from that show "all saints". its a wonder why i haven't ever heard of them or their show. other than that, the bus driver, which you never even see, just him closing the door, has had more action that just about everyone together. at least he handles stunts for some decent films.i like to see scary movies, i really do. but this one blew so much, the entire audience was laughing at it and cheering the characters on halfway through. very annoying. the child behind me was yelping more during the previews of other horror films.this is not a film to see, even less if you have to pay for it.

i had no idea this movie was produced by "wwe". wrestling is lame enough. why did they have to soil their name further by making a movie as crappy as this one was?? i found it to be a complete disappointment. if i had of known this movie was going to be as stupid as it was, i would have stayed home and done something more entertaining. sure, i'll give them the credit of the cool effects; but the killer didn't seem as scary as he could have been. he lacked a number of things. but i'll let you point them out for yourselves. the plot was a great idea, just could have been done in a much better way. maybe in the future, wwe will stick to its moronic wrestling and stay out of the film industry..

i got stuck in traffic (i live in sicily) on the way to the theater (at a military base) to see superman returns, was 15 minutes late, and the only other movie playing was "see no evil", there was no poster up for it, and just a short description of the movie on the schedule...but my girlfriend and i decided to check it out...as soon as i saw it was produced by wwe i just knew it was gonna be awful. the few people in the theater were laughing most of the time, and it was the first movie that i honestly considered walking out on, and i've seen "the ringer"...okay, i would have walked out of that one, but i was too busy sleeping. the death of the bad guy at the end was pretty good, but other than that, it was just stupid.

another movie with a star of a wrestling. so far i have noticed....wrestlers can't act on the movie screen. this movie is no exception.the action is dreadful. it makes you laugh at what they say, and they can't be serious, they try to act scared but they fail and look stupid. the acting is horrible, possibly from the bad director.the plot was stupid....just some people get placed in a hotel because they're criminals, and they get randomly killed off. the movie is stupid all the way through, making it one of the worst i have ever seen.the only think and this is why i give it a 3 and not a 1 is because of the way jacob goodnight dies. the pole through the head and the stories of him plunging was awesome.overall this is a really horrible movie, and you definitely shouldn't waste your time with it.

after watching this movie, i have nothing but contempt for any of those who were involved in the making of this abysmal film. for one, as a general comment, the storyline was literally unbelievable and filled with incredible clichés all around. the same obviously goes for the dialogue which panders to the lowest common denominator and manages to offer absolutely zero unpredictable original lines. the acting was terrible as well with kane showing, throughout the entire movie, at the very most 3 separate and distinct emotions. even the use of modern special effects failed, as each prop was easily distinguishable from its real life counterpart. overall, i would not recommend for anyone to even think about viewing this feature, as it will most surely waste 83(not even 90!) minutes of your life.

the first official release of world wrestling entertainment's film division is a pretty basic horror/slasher movie called "see no evil" starring kane, one of their big men wrestlers known for having an intimidating presence, hard-hitting moves, and one of the most convoluted backstories in wrestling. and let's not pull any punches here; while this movie is promoted as the greatest horror movie of all time (mostly by wwe), it goes without saying that after having seen this movie, i can confirm it as one of the greatest comedies of all time."see no evil" sees a bunch of juvenile delinquents sent to a hotel so they can clean up. of course, a monstrous murderer (played by kane) also happens to be living in this hotel and we all know where that goes. without giving away too much of the movie plot, this film has all the semblance and structure of an early-1980s slasher flick with most of the clichés intact, but without any of the scares that those films accompany. and that's sort of the main problem with "see no evil". it tries so many of the tricks implied by its predecessors in the genre that it comes off as predictable; veteran horror fans will easily recognize some of the gimmicks ahead of time and even those who have only seen a few flicks should tell what happens next. it's too generic to be scary.the movie's gory, no doubt, but it's only there for the effect. the dark atmosphere instilled in the movie gives off that feel of terror initially, but as you get towards the end, it somehow feels out of place and gets tiresome quickly. the death scenes don't come off as gory and horrific as much as they do laughable, although some of them are pretty inventive.and the acting in this movie is pretty bad too, as the main characters aren't developed enough for us to care when they eventually do get axed. some can't even portray fear properly; they just scream and cry in a vain effort to emote. so when they die, it only adds to the comedy because you don't care enough about them that you simply consider them the equivalent of starfleet redshirts to the monster kane.as for kane, he simply portrayed his movie character the same way he portrays his wrestling character, only he uses axes and hooks instead of hellfire and brimstone. there's no doubt in my mind that kane can be a great fixture in the horror genre. he has the look and presence for it; he just needs better material (specifically a script that isn't written by someone who writes wrestling shows) to work with.now, despite what may seem like a harsh review, i actually enjoyed the film. it's one of those laughably bad movies that you can't help but sit down and enjoy. my main gripe with the film, again, is that it's simply an exercise in filming gory kills and doesn't have any frightening or shock moments. i enjoyed it, but i enjoyed because it was easy for me to laugh off some of what was supposed to be scary moments in the movie. if that happens because it was supposed to be that way, the movie would have been rated higher. but it didn't. it got laughs because it's a b-movie and it doesn't help that the director's previous experiences was porn flicks and music videos; not exactly overcomplicated things to direct anyway. nonetheless, i enjoyed it tremendously.if you don't mind a fun b-movie or funny horror film, i'd highly recommend "see no evil." if you are a true enthusiast of the genre, i'd wait until the dvd comes out before checking it out. everyone else should probably go watch something else.

eh it's not really as good as the other dragonballs. the villains are actually rip-offs of other z villains like cell, frieza, and even majin buu. with baby being frieza's clone, super 17 being cell's clone, and the shadow dragons being buu's clone(s). the story is also very bad as it deals with goku shrinking. shrinking!! it deals with him shrinking to like the size of an eight year old just to get it going. let us not forget how weak the characters become. gohan can't go mystic anymore and is even weaker than pan.(it's sad i know). speaking of pan she was so cute at the end of z now she's lost all that cuteness and become an irritating,whiny little girl whose sole purpose in this series is to get in the way. goten doesn't even have a purpose in the series and trunks... well i don't know what to say about trunks. gt is just an attempt to milk the popular dragonball franchise. if you really like dragonball then avoid this series. it doesn't even feel like dragonball. i will be fair though as the ending however was really good and is actually pretty sad (at least to me) and the theme songs both ending and opening are better (japanese, not american). might've been better if toriyama san worked on it.

there are so many logical errors in this show it's barely worth me stating. 1) mystic gohan is non existent 2) uub is as powerful as majin buu yet plays absolutely no role in the show, somehow he is easily overpowered by every bad guy 3) the whole super saiyan 4 idea is retarded and it's appalling that he loses to super 17 (which is the worst idea for a db villain ever) 4) super saiyan 4 goku is no match for super 17 but non transformed goku using a move he learned in a movie that wasn't supposed to happen, kills him with ease 5) vegeta is utterly useless 6) no character other than goku has any impact to the outcome of the battles 7) the series ends with a spirit bomb...come on 8) goku invincible? absorbs dragonballs? lame 9) gotenks?...better yet goten??? trunks??? they both suck 10) super saiyan 4 involves a magical transformation into an adult 11) goku is a kid 12) goku is a kid 13) no super saiyan level 2 (characterized by electricity) 14) no imagination with the animation of gogeta 15) gogeta utterly useless 16) big bang kamehameha is the biggest let down in anime history (not really logical but i'm going off on a tangent) 17) shortest character fights everi could go on longer if i hadn't repressed the majority of memories associated with this show. when i make enough money i am going to fund the remaking of this series.

i bought the dvd of this movie because i am a fan of william devane and i was really disappointed about "a christmas visitor". the story of the movie is so boring and slow in the development that you just want to turn off your tv or dvd player after about the half of it. the dialogues are really bad and belong to a daily soap opera but not in a tv movie. william devane was alright in his part and he was acting quite good, but he did so much better in other movies and projects. meredith baxter was horrible and couldn't really bring the warm hearted mother to the viewers. instead she was playing very cool and wasn't better than a middle-class actress. i absolutely cannot recommend this movie. spare your time and your money for this one.

this film gives a look at the suffering a family experiences at the death of a child, and the healing that can finally come to them.the family learns of the death of their son on christmas eve, 1991, ruining the christmas season for them. they do not celebrate it again for many years. there is an interesting comment by the daughter that will remind viewers to consider the needs of surviving children in such a situation.the matthew character makes a reference to jesus, but i suspect that other comments he makes come from non-christian sources. i wonder if any other viewers would recognize those comments. if so, it would be an interesting addition to the data on this movie.

i felt i had to add a comment after seeing the breathless gushing of the other comment. i was taken to see this film as a child by my unknowing parents, expecting a normal norman wisdom jolly romp comedy. instead, what you get is this insipid british sex comedy of the worst kind where norman (norman!) plays a swinger aiming to get off with as many 'birds' as possible. absolutely typical of the genre - poorly filmed and acted, no semblance of a script beyond the worst kind of double-entendre, and very vague hints of 'naughtiness'. and all seemingly on that special grainy film stock that is reserved for 1960's-1970's british low budget films. about the only memorable thing is the annoyingly catchy theme tune, which still pops up in my brain after 30-odd years.finally, in the last scene you also get to see norman naked - running across the sand and looking frozen. i think so anyway- at that point my mother hauled me out of the cinema. i saw it again, many years later, and guess what, it was still dire.if you're any fan or take any interest in the little man and his career, you'll apply the '10-foot-bargepole' rule to this. believe me, you do not need to see norman wisdom's backside.

it's a shame that someone so idolised by many kids as well as parents should demean himself in appearing in this exploitative, bandwagon-jumping tripe. i often wonder if mr wisdom in his later years looked back at his excuse for a film with any pride. at least sally geeson had the decency to retire to doing something worthwhile after appearing in this low budget rubbish. a cameo by some long forgotten pop called the pretty things cannot rescue the film from it's awfulness. if you want 60's nostalgia invest in 'here we go round the mulberry bush' instead, starring barry evans and sally's sister judy instead.

eight teen convicts are brought to the abandoned blackwell hotel to clean it out as community service. they soon discover that it's the residence of a hulking psychopath (kane) who has a thing for pulling out and collecting eyeballs. it doesn't help that the guard watching over them (steven vidler) has had a previous run-in with the beast four years earlier. a guilty pleasure of mine are slasher films. most of them are poorly directed and acted but they still hold some appeal and entertainment value. see no evil is a good example of this. it features atrocious writing and acting but the death scenes are pretty good and the movie proves to be entertaining. the premise sounds like a mixture between friday the 13th, saw 2 and halloween: resurrection. i really liked the idea but it didn't work out too well. it was really just a bunch of clichés and everything was predictable. screenwriter dan madigan just focused on the death scenes and nothing else apparently. the death scenes themselves are pretty good and gruesome. director gregory dark did a good job with them and he came up with some creative kills. the acting is pretty bland and unremarkable. this is because all of the characters are one dimensional and we don't know much about them. it was hard to feel for these people because they were pretty unlikable. kane is surprisingly mediocre. i was expecting his on screen presence to be scarier but he didn't do that good of a job. a second rate jason voorhees, if you will. the rest of the actors are relatively unknown and this film will probably neither help nor hurt their careers. while the death scenes are gory, they aren't necessary scary. there's really no suspense just some gory death scenes. because of this, the movie doesn't hold much of a repeat value. also, if you don't like slasher films then don't waste your time with this one. it will do little to change your opinion. in the end, see no evil is a decent slasher film but it is generic and forgettable so it's not exactly worth watching. rating 6/10

as i write this, norman wisdom is a very confused old man who spends most of his waking hours cackling and yelping old catch-phrases at his increasingly suicidal nurse.indeed, by the time you read this he will probably have joined the hereafter and the obituaries will record a near 80 year career of hysterical mirth-making from the lovable funster with the crooked chequered cap. what most of these obituaries won't recall is how norman wisdom had already committed a form of suicide back in the late 1960s with this staggeringly poor, yet strangely compelling endpaper to his movie career.the signs are ominous from the off  "tony tenser presents" go the titles. you scratch your head  "where have i seen that name before..?" well, on the titles of a lot of the cheapest, crappiest british films of the 1970s so just take your pick.then it says  "a menahem golan production". oh dear.from what i could make out what follows is a combination of confessions from a holiday camp and last tango in paris. sponsored by the southport tourist board.norman wisdom is very versatile at being norman wisdom (or a variation of such) here. even in trash like this, he's never off form and somehow keeps you watching through parted fingers as he paws and dribbles all over a (clearly insane) sally geeson. tony tenser and menahem golan were, between them, responsible for some true cinematic horrors but the bedroom scene in filmic atrocity reborn. sally plays the role of a lobotomised sex toy very well, by the way.i wonder if any of the crazy young cats who populate this movie's party scenes maybe thought to themselves in a quiet moment "ummold norman+sex+hippies. get me outta this mess!!" i guess it was a payday for them.a do feel sorry for the pretty things though. they probably thought "yeah! this'll do for us what blow up did for the yardbirds" and so old norman's leading man career ended. freezing his little balls off in southport.i went there once. it was a depressing place.

norman wisdom's final starring vehicle was a departure from his previous outings  bringing his accident-prone milquetoast up-to-date, this being a product of the swinging sixties! the end result is an uneasy and occasionally embarrassing comedy which mixes the star's typical slapstick (and sentimentality) with mild sexuality and even milder satire; the plot has to do with an executive on a trip for a banking conference falling for teenager sally geeson (who doesn't mind getting involved with him but doesn't take their relationship all that seriously either); sarah atkinson appears as geeson's friend who warns norman of her fickle character.the film is nowhere near as bad as leonard maltin's bomb rating would have it and, if anything, is interesting for its treatment of mid-life crisis (being in many ways similar to hoffman [1970] and 10 [1979]  both of which, incidentally, i've only just watched); towards the end, norman even tries to bring his wife round to his new way of thinking! the pretty things appear as themselves performing a number of good tunes in a nightclub and norm himself sings the catchy title track!

well acted, yes. very well, i must say, even though i don't speak chezck. nice cinematography. but the script is lame, really lame. a predictable soap opera, in which you know exactly everything that is going to happen. ok, maybe the ending isn't as predictable, but is it any good? it is one of those films that you have the feeling that have seen already, and forget about the day after.i just got a note from imdb saying that my comment was not long enough. that's really sad, because i have no idea of what else to say about this movie, which actually says a a lot about it, don't you think? the thing is.. .it has no soul and no originality. compare this movie with barrio, or riff raff, shot more than ten years ago (or the extraordinary recently shot the child). it's sad to see that this is a much worse film.

czech cinematography is traveling through dark times... this movie is a tangible evidence. slama obviously wanted to make a mediocre documentary about fictive people, characteristic of their stupidity. a young and healthy boy who doesn't want to work and prefer to live in a decaying shack with a feckless alcoholic aunt. because of the idiocy of tonik, who's just able to announce "dad, i'll not work in the factory" (i'd really like to know why); i understand the condition of his "house", but i'm really not able to digest the horrible mess around. cramped sentimentality everywhere. why didn't monika escort her boy to work abroad? young czech couples do it very often. and take someone else's children to live in a devastated barn... that's too much.irresponsible mother (badly acted by geislerová), naive & stupid boy (tonik), silly and confused girl (monika)... yes, somebody has already told it - badly directed and acted soap opera. actors like martin huba, bolek polivka, tatiana wilhelmova and simona stasova did their best, but unfortunately it couldn't save the whole piece.

okay, so maybe the acting wasn't bad, but i am typing this review as a public service to prevent anyone else who happens upon the intriguing beginning of this telefilm from throwing away two hours of their life waiting for some plot development that will never come. the chief investigator has a gut feeling who did away with the missing marine officer (guy), and few people other than uninvolved bystanders and the accusee seem to dispute her. so what is the point of staying with this drama? beats the heck out of me. i kept thinking (or hoping) there would be some sort of plot twist or new revelation, but none was forthcoming. in summary, i cannot think of a single reason to sit and watch this pointless tv movie, based on a true story or not.

jeff powers (lou diamond phillips, "young guns 1&2"), a cop with a history of roughing up criminals, is recruited into an elite clandestine lapd division. this doesn't sit well with jeff's newspaper reporter girlfriend, kelly (chelsea field) who's looking for a story on the squad. soon enough jeff's conscience gets the better of him which puts him at odds with dan vaughn (scott glenn, "the hunt for red october" & "backdraft"), the leader of the unit.this is a fairly routine, dare i say mundane, cop-action/drama that holds no surprises thanks to a cookie-cutter plot that's content to go strictly from point a to point b. the acting is all right for what the actors were given to work with however that's no real reason to watch the film. kinda sad seeing as the six previous mark l. lester directed films right before this one (from class of 1984 to showdown in little tokyo) were all highly entertaining vehicles. eye candy: chelsea field gets briefly toplessmy grade: d+

unlike what one reviewer said this is not a ripoff of magnum force. in that one lieutenant hal holbrook put together his own little squad from academy rookies to dispatch repeat offenders. in extreme justice this operation has the sanction from the higher ups of the lapd. just how far they sanction the exact methods used is open to question. this special investigations squad seems to be quite the haven for the misfits of the lapd, those that have forgotten their first duty is protection and service. which is why scott glenn thinks lou diamond phillips, a detective with more than his share of beefs with internal affairs for excessive use of force, is perfect for the squad.what should have sent him running from phillips is the fact he's got a nice live-in relationship with a reporter, chelsea field. that one certainly threw me in this film, you'd think that lou would be the last guy he'd try to recruit for his team.and what his team is, is a death squad. they target perpetrators follow them and wait to catch them in the act. then it's open season.extreme justice went very overboard in trying to make a point. there sure would have been no harm in waiting for a gang of bank robbers to finish the robbery and taking them down outside. no civilians got hurt when the citizens of coffeyville did that to the daltons. or waiting until three rapists finish the job before moving in. that's what were asked to believe here.and frankly i couldn't buy it. a lot of good players get really wasted in this one.

after consuming "human pork chop" and properly digesting it, i felt urged and obliged to inform potential viewers, that chewing on this product is no fun and its substance of low nutritive value.according to the dull nature of this film, the following is gonna be a warning more than a review. this is the first time i wished, that there is an "i-don't-care-to-rate-this-movie"-button on imdb, because the only reaction to this boring piece of trash is stasis and indifference. every possible rating would do injustice to all the other items listed here, a "10" is out of question anyway, "1" might persuade some readers, that this is one of those cases where "it's so bad that it's actually really bad and that's kewl!", and "5" is unsatisfying as well, people might think, that it's an ok-flick and alright if you wanna have some cheesy fun, which it is not... honest to god, it's neither a "10", a zero nor a 5, it's nothing, a black hole, a futile work conceived by an embryo. i bought the region 3 dvd, which was cheap (7 bucks!!!) at least and of good picture-quality, i bought it mainly because of the positive and promising reviews posted below my own entry. oh boy, was i to be disappointed. this movie is neither shocking nor disgusting nor unnerving nor... it's not even laughable, it doesn't take itself too serious to be laughed at, but still serious enough so as not to be comic. a truly unpassionate, amateurish effort. the only sequence that i found mildly disturbing is when two giggling thugs put an ugly dog in a bag and bash it against a brick wall... but even such a cruel premise only lead to a poor execution. the further down cited toilet scene is unrealistic and filmmed without any sense for suspense, suffering or humiliation - the feces look like painted marsh-mellows!!! there is a butchery scene at the end of a loooong 85-minutes where three men dressed in plastic raincoats (a setup which one finds also depicted on the front cover of the dvd) start to dispose of the female body. reminded me of "american psycho" and "shallow grave", now these flicks are worth watching and true masterpieces.let's be realistic for once and not rush to make a myth out of every asian-wannabe-scary-movie, as seems to happen lately...if you are looking out for some eastern horror then try danny lee's masterpiece of the very same (english) title "ba xian fan dian zhi ren rou cha shao bao" (human pork chop) it's from 1992 and has - not without reason i might add - been compared to "henry: portrait of a serial killer". there is also a similar film telling the same story by a different film crew called "ren tou dou fu shang" ("there is a secret in my soup") of the same year, sort of a rival production. it's available as a region 3 dvd and by most regarded as superior to "peng shi zhi sang jin tian liang". i might add a few more words on the special effects... what special effects?!?... there are a few chopped off limbs, they look awful - in a wrong sense - probably "made in hong kong".that's about all the info i can share on this subject, hopefully it will prove helpful... enjoy your meal!

ordinarily, i wouldn't waste the time on reviewing a film like "human pork chop" (the 2001 version, not to be confused with the earlier film of the same title, which is probably better known in the west as "the untold story"), but since the reviews already here are quite vague as to what it actually consists of, i figured i'd best post something more detailed, so as no one actually gets tempted (as i was) into buying it because of the film's mystique. i honestly would just say stay away.**** major spoilers are contained below ****"human pork chop", i was expecting to be like a chinese interpretation of the popular japanese "guinea pig" films. anyone who's watched enough of that series can see where its makers are coming from. there's a strong sense of humour running throughout it - you can't watch the ludicrous "he never dies" without laughing and "the making of guinea pig" is a fabulous turning of the whole thing on its head, proving it was just made, with some glee, by fairly good natured gorehounds. all the gp films have a punk rock, diy, shot-on-video aesthetic, occasional flashes of genuine artistry ("mermaid in a manhole"), an angry political agenda and a warped, deranged zeal that sets them in a league of their own."human pork chop" has none of the above.it's shot on 35mm film (with disarmingly good production values), it's 90 gruelling minutes long and it's utterly devoid of anything redeeming. the plot tells, in flashback at a police interviewing of the suspects, of the systematic torture, death and eventual dismemberment of grace, a heroin-addicted streetwalker who is kidnapped and brutalised by her pimp and his henchmen when she steals money from him.despite its fleeting attempts at being a morality play, the film possesses a detached, inhumane feel to it and one can't help but dwell on the mindsets of those behind it. although it half-heartedly paints grace as an innocent victim, the mean-spirited nature of its screenplay and the protagonist's constant, vicious dialogue veers towards a shocking, utterly unwelcome "she deserves it!" point of view which makes the whole thing almost impossible to watch. far more time is spent detailing grace's degradation and when her captors are eventually deemed guilty and jailed, it seems like a hurried afterthought on behalf of the writers who've long since stopped caring less.what makes it boggling as to why anyone would want to watch such a film is that even the kind of people who do really get off on mindless sex and violence in the movies would be severely missing out. the torture is just a continuous stream of kickings, slappings, verbal abuse, psychological abuse and then increasingly bizarre displays of power on behalf of the captors use grace's heroin addiction to make her do their bidding. and when i say that, don't get me wrong, incidentally. unlike "guinea pig" with it's frequent barrage of nudity that gives an almost teenage feel of mock-titillation to the proceedings in spite of the ultraviolence, "human pork chop" has no such sexual overtones. there isn't any actual nudity in the film and the violence is performed purely out of malice by the odious protagonists (who early in the film are seen stuffing a dog into a bag and banging it against a brick wall - don't worry, not real, just a cheap special effect!).the only actual bloodshed in the film is towards the end when they dismember grace's body and boil the bones, all very poor special fx (nowhere near "guinea pig" level) and, by that stage, you'll probably be already feeling too miserable and sick to even care what's going on.the film is depressingly bleak and uncompromising along a similar line to buddy giovinazzo's "combat shock" and i guess could even be compared, at a push. both movies deal with the gradual physical decline of an individual who exists in a nightmarish environment devoid of any social or morally redeemable characters and both movies 'climax' in a particularly visceral manner with the individual's inevitable, inescapable doom.in fairness, neither 'glamourises' it's violence (whereas "guinea pig" could easily be accused of this) but one can't help but wonder where the place is for a film like this. it fails to many any real points in its frank presentation of such brutality and with a leaden-pace, a virtually non-existent plot line and the aforementioned lack of any entertainment value, i just can't understand what would encourage anyone to watch something like this. i only made it to the end, purely for the purpose of being able to review it fairly... which i hope i've now done.overall score: 0 of of 10. welcome to the bottom of the barrel.

star rating: ***** saturday night **** friday night *** friday morning ** sunday night * monday morning as a boy, mark goddard (c thomas howell) sat powerless as his family, including his hero cop father (jeff fahey), were brutally murdered by vicious criminals he'd tried to bring down. with an inner desire to punish wrong-doers festering in him as he grew up as a result of this, mark employs tough means when bringing the suspects he's chasing down in and gets into a lot of trouble with his superiors because of this. but then he learns of 'justice incorporated', a secret group of men and women lead by a mysterious man (ed lauter) who serve to dish out punishment that fits the crime outside the law.but, then things get out of hand and getting out alive might be harder than he thought.the sweeper gets into problems from the off-set, because we've seen this exact same plot done before (and better) in films like the star chamber with michael douglas and magnum force with clint eastwood. the title doesn't make any sense either. but we also have to contend with the movie's utter ludicrousness, including a scene where a daughter's headphone manages to drown out the sound of her family being slaughtered, a finale involving a chase with a bad guy that starts on the freeway and ends on a wright brothers plane, as well as some of the most ridiculous acting ever put on screen and a very clichéd, pretentious script. but there's some cool action sequences here and there and the movie's unintentional laughs factor certainly keeps it alive with a pulse. **

all right, let's be realistic about this. nobody goes into a movie produced by wwe films (whose owner has challenged god to a wrestling match), directed by a former porn director (the man gave the world the between the cheeks trilogy), starring a wrestler named kane, and expects a little slice of art on a golden platter. if you do then you probably need to find something other than watching movies to occupy your time.so what exactly are we to expect from a movie like this? well, here's what i was looking forward to:1) bad acting. 2) a fairly non-existent, clichéd storyline. 3) kane walking around with a scrunched, sour face that indicates his nostrils just found the potato salad he misplaced a month ago. 4) tons and tons of gore. well, if you're hungry for some "so bad it's funny" entertainment then this might satisfy your appetite because it delivers on all counts.obviously, movies like this are best seen for free, but if you do choose to sacrifice box office bucks then have some fun and make a game out of it. the filmmakers are nice enough to introduce us to each of the annoying delinquents by flashing their names and legal offenses on the screen. this makes it easier for you to write down which ones you want to see killed and in what order. you and your friends can see whose predictions are most accurate.i also suggest that you and your pals write down every single moment of stupidity and inanity that you can find. tally them up at the end and see who comes up with the most. i think my grand total was 107; can you beat that? i personally want to know how after 35 years and a fire does this abandoned hotel still have electricity, running water, and a working elevator?i know, i know, the filmmakers are assuming that if you pay to see this then you obviously don't put much thought into what you spend your money on and therefore likely won't put much thought into how silly the movie is, but that doesn't mean we can't point it out and laugh at it.i also like how the city wants to turn this huge hotel (which would be condemned and recommended for demolition by any sensible inspector) into a homeless shelter and they think the best way to get it cleaned up is to give eight punks a few mops and brooms. uh-huh.i think you pretty much know what to expect, but i feel the need to provide you with a couple of warnings. first, if you hate crowd interaction no matter the movie then you might want to stay away. the people in the audience acted like they were at an actual wrestling show. shouts of "kill him, kane!" and "i hope you die first!" and "chokeslam!" echoed through the theater, showcasing what i hope is not the best of what america has to offer. i usually don't appreciate such audience interaction, but for a cheesefest like this i thought the commentary added to the entertainment value. however, i can see how others could be annoyed by it.second, and this shouldn't even warrant explanation, the film doesn't shy away from the gore. if watching a big ugly dude rip eyeballs right out of their sockets doesn't scream "fun night at the movies!" for ya then you know good and well to save your dough.i must say that i was a little surprised by the extreme lack of dialogue on kane's part. i wasn't expecting him to put on an acting clinic, but i was hoping he'd have some cute little catchphrase like "say goodnight" (his character's last name is "goodnight") right before he killed a victim. instead he uttered four words in the entire film - "nooooooo!" and "i see it." but hey, he delivered them flawlessly!if i were a bad guy in a movie then my catchphrase would be something like "place your betts!" or "all betts are off!" it'd rule and you know it. we need a new genre term for bad horror films like see no evil that induce so much unintentional laughter that you almost have to label them comedic. feel free to send me your suggestions. for now we'll just call 'em hor-larious!

i got interested in this movie because somebody had made a beautiful video for björks "bachelorette" with clips from it. so i watched the movie. and it is indeed stuningly beautiful. a masterpiece of animation.unfortunately, the story doesn't keep up. it starts out well, with interesting plotlines about people fencing for the possession of the rose bride, but suddenly elevators fill up with water and looses their walls, people float away, and finally for no reason whatsoever, utena is tranformed into a car, and a highspeed chase ensues.i like much anime for it's ability to make alternative universes, but this universe is just stupid. if you are gonna watch this movie, turn of the sound, it's better that way.

this was a first feature for clinton, i was there, while he shot this mess back in adelaide around 98...although i wasn't involved directly in the production, i was witness to the typically delusional behavior, post set, that went down,: the parties, the drugs, the illusionary glamor, really an example of what not to do when making a film, but also a byproduct of young, talented people getting caught up in classic ideologies of fame & worldly position.i like clinton, we had a curious friendship, he deserves to have another crack with a more mature script...there the problems lay, and i'm sure a much better job will be done, if there's a next time round.! because, frankly, he certainly didn't do himself any favours with this on his cv and neither did the cast...but hey, it was a paying job, in country where actors regularly starve to deathin summary, fascinating to watch 'the making of' basically, not so much fun to experience (alas!).

missed it at the cinema, but was always slightly compelled. found it in the throw-out bin at my local video shop for a measly two bucks! will i now give it away to anyone who wants it? probably! no purposeful plot, one dimensional characters, plastic world ripped off from many far better films, no decent dialogue to speak of. you know that empty feeling when you come down off ecstasy? its that feeling right here. sad thing is, the australia i know is heading in this direction, minus the melodrama and simple answers. interesting only to see the older aussie actors (who had to act back in their day to get by) vs the newer aussie actors (who have to look good to get by). like some horribly garish narrative introduction to a film clip that never actually starts... poor kylie, started her career as an actress as well...

first: the recent campaigning of this movie is a huge hoax. judging from the cover you'd think this was some kind of scandal movie about kylie playing a character having sex, taking drugs and whatever. this is just a cheap market-scheme. she's barely in it and does neither of the things. the marketing here is unbelievable, and i'm surprised the filmmakers hasn't objected. the movie itself was to me a huge disappointment. it seemed like a sunset beach episode directed sloppy-handed by a teenage quentin tarantino. and thats not meant as a compliment, mind you. i think the weakness of the movie first of all is the story. it seems to be about nothing. just about cool teenagers tripping around living 'on the edge'. the characters themselves does have some personality though, but the movie doesn't use its potential. as said, there's no story of any substance here. it seems to elaborate too much on cool dialog and ends up looking like a colorful mtv ad. it definitely has that feeling. still though, i guess some people might enjoy it, but i'd say there's far better movies like this around.

what a nasty cynical film. apparently this sad excuse for a dramatic urban look at what 20 year olds do whilst crawling through the gutter of sydney nightlife is supposed to be somehow connecting with its target market. made by some industry nobody and pals who seemingly thought they could cobble together any sleazy behavior with a young cast and pour it into multiplexes, sample people deservedly failed miserably at the australian box office. it is so offensive in its clichéd depictions of obvious and easy targets it was fully rejected by the very audience it was intended. shoddy and cruel and with no attempt to offer quality or resonance to the young audience who might have been attracted by the marketing or casting sample people might have been interesting or even informative if not botched by its exploitive view of 'what teens want to see in a movie'. the character played by ben mendelsohn is particularly offensive and kylie minogue is again wasted by poor material and untalented film makers. it is as if the producers thought teens would watch any ugly trash and just slung-together scenes and characters who were shallow and soul less. well the were very wrong. a mini budget film made in 1983 called going down got this topic right and is an excellent antidote to this poison.

there was a lot of hype of this movie and the commercials made it seem like it would be great. sadly, like bring it on 2, bring it on 3 shamed glory of the original bring it on. there is shameless stereotyping throughout the film. the lines given to the actors were humiliating for all the races involved in the film. the performance of hayden panattiere was sub-par both in terms of acting and cheerleading. there were several scenes in which i literally cringed because i was embarrassed for the cast because the scene (lines, plot, etc) were just so stupid. my recommendation to the makers of any future bring it on films is that you should hire good cheerleaders and teach them to act because the "acting" of the cast was horrendous and their lack of cheerleading ability made them completely useless to the film. only great character: kirresha.

seriously, i couldn't find anything that constituted a rational human thought in this movie. for some reason, the writer decided to have a bunch of actors in random places grunting, groveling and yelling like cro-magnon bipeds. i understand that this was about gymnastics, but seriously, what's with all the roaring and human bleating ? i also saw at least five actors with overactive terrets syndrome and stage 10 syphilis.although this movie has actual human acrobatics, i must say it is surprising that you can make a movie like this without having any intelligible form of human speech patterns. this is truly a milestone in the history of film-making because there was no conscious decision to make the characters express anything more than a timely urrrrr ! or rfff ! sound.incredible.

without a doubt, one of the most racially prejudiced films i've ever seen, with the prejudice being levelled against hayden panettiere as she has to move into a tough inner city school. she is constantly called "white girl" and other slurs based on her colour. firstly would this be allowed the other way around if a black girl was the butt of all the abuse? and secondly the stereotyping of the ethnic kids from the inner city school is also a disgrace. the writers apparent desire to show they were "hip" also extended to missing the point that the inner city school win the cheerleading competition, not through talent but by intimidating their white opponents!! these overtones to the film took it away from it's expected direction of a harmless lighthearted comedy suitable for a family audience into a vehicle that does none of the participants any credit. hayden panettiere has star quality but i would be surprised if any of the rest of the class ever get much further. all in all a charmless film that was a waste of time.

this was terrible, mean-spirited, and full of the worst clichés and racial stereotypes i've seen in a looong time. seeing hayden p trying to act "ghetto" was painful (hi, one pant leg up on yer sweats and some braids downs't make you "down with the homies"). solange knowles pretty much grimaces through the entire movie. most of the set sequences look like they were filmed in cardboard boxes...what was up with the finale??? and poor rihanna was just plain exploited to get people to watch her "act", which she can't.put simply, this film downs't even deserve one star. please put this tired franchise to rest. or at least make the next one bring it on iv: cheerleaders vs. freddy & jason.

ho humm - - - more of nothing. if you are a long-time rush fan you know what this video contains: loathsome songs from the past, the "big 3" hits from the 80's and their "last-ditch" efforts to remain contemporary. they do succeed in making fun of themselves by beating the critics to the punch by portraying themselves as "dinosaurs." unfortunately, they fail at protecting themselves from embarrassment. close-ups of their faces only add to the fact that these guys have been.if you are have been following (as much as you can stomach) the band for a couple of decades from the 70's, then you know there is no new material here. same old, same old: 1) neil avoids the press, 2) no real behind-the-scenes (geddy looses his shoes?! give me a break! even he thinks it's absurd!) 3) no new insights.a better video would have been to show the crew setting up for 3 or 4 hours  just let the camera run. and stop changing camera angles every 2 seconds! i understand the director wants to try to do something artsy. but then offer a full concert version of 2 or 3 shots the viewer can choose. we know what the band looks like  let us see what we really want to see.do yourself a big favor: rent this movie first.

the first two bring it on movies were both quite good in their own ways. the first was fairly serious, the second was successfully satirical - and the third opted for the usual idiotic low-brow comedy that we always see in the utterly brainless teen movies that hollywood has coming out of the woodwork. the entire point in this movie was that cheerleaders are total airheads who hardly know enough to carry on a common conversation, and that's the extent of this movie's comedy. ha ha. not.there is no shred of cleverness in this movie, no theme, no subtext, nothing for anybody with half a brain to be entertained by (and sure enough, i could not sit through all of it). if you're the sort of person who're entertained by fart jokes, this movie is for you. congratulations.2 out of 10.

stars: hayden pantierre.there have been so many movies that have this exact same plot, and this one is just a poor rehashing of it. populer white girl moves to ethnic school, doesn't fit in, soon becomes accepted. originality is nonexistent in this, and neither are the laughs. it uses so many old poorly executed jokes it's annoying. i don't know why they think it's a good idea to make made for video sequels to mediocre films, but it isn't. with that said, the positives in this are that all the people in it are fairly competent actors and actresses.my rating: * out of ****. pg-13 for language and sexual humor.

the strawberry blond has a great script, but i just wish errol flynn was in it instead of james cagney, he's not the person for the part. i do think olivia did a great job. this movie is also a day dream wrap around, so it's hard to follow. i don't like the male character attitude; the way cagney presented it was just off. i give it a 3 for poor acting by main male character. ( if you like tough ruff men that like to fight all the time and argue then this is your movie). the strawberry blond would have been better if the main character had more of a positve attitude, and change the script so he is happy he's with oliva.this movie points out money does not bring happiness, women right jokes. plain and simple not the best movie, but every one must decide for themselves.

from all the rave reviews, we couldn't wait to see this show. we love wacky humor and creative material, especially from australia and new zealand.i admit this may not be a fair review since we only saw the first 15 minutes. but we just couldn't bear any more misery - it was definitely the most boring and painful 15 minutes we've ever experienced watching a tv show - it felt like 15 hours. the songs may be (mildly) interesting by themselves, but inserted for an interminable 3 minutes each in the middle of a story scene just doesn't work.we're trying hard now to erase the memory. if you want some wonderful down-under humor in a delightful and engaging film, see "the dish" instead.

this show is perhaps one of the most boring, most unfunny shows i've ever seen. while the humour was subtle, and i'm all for the subtle humour; the jokes just weren't funny.the show is about two kiwis in their mid-thirties living in new york trying to start their music careers.i saw the one episode where brett leaves the other kiwi behind during a mugging. okay, the plot idea has potential; but i got the feeling that half the episode was just filler, and the other half was actually important to the story.what i mean is, they kept on explaining how the one who was left behind felt betrayed and had a lot of mistrust for the other guy. i've got one piece of advice for the writers: mention it once for the idiots who can't figure it out by the way he's acting, and move on.and i found the characters were annoying. the character who left the other behind, brett, came across as being overly innocent and naive, the one left behind walked around talking in this monotone and robotic voice.a third character, who was the band manager, was obviously incompetent, but he was the one character that i liked. he's also the one that earned the show a one-star rating.all in all, a show i have no intention of ever watching again.

i tuned into this movie not because i am a fan of u.s. high school basketball (in fact i only rarely watch nba games) but rather because i am a fan of gene hackman, who usually manages to bring an impressive depth to his performances. in this case, however, i was sorely disappointed. this was not one of the bright shining stars of hackman's career.in fairness to him, he didn't have a lot to work with. as norman dale, the new coach of a small town high school basketball team in indiana, he wasn't called on to do much acting. basically his performance consisted of pacing up and down basketball sidelines ranting at the referees. i didn't find him particularly believable in the role to be honest. i also was unimpressed with the requisite romance between dale and myra fleener (barbara hershey). quite honestly there was absolutely no chemistry between hackman and hershey. the romance never captured my attention, and neither did the basketball "action," which was altogether too predictable.there were far too many problems with this movie to make it worthwhile. i never did understand the depth of the sheer hatred that so many of the townsfolk had for dale, almost from before the time he arrived. the character development was poor and the story itself was poorly developed. too much basketball and not enough human interaction, in my opinion. how many shots of kids shooting baskets do we need to see to get the point that this is a basketball movie? there was no suspense: is it even possible to doubt that hickory is going to win the big one? i realize that this is based on a true story, but i guess it proves that not every true story should be a movie. quite frankly, it just wasn't a very interesting movie. definitely a movie gene hackman would like to forget.no better than a 2/10 in my opinion.

a poor basketball movie. a gruff coach with a dubious background comes to a small indiana high school basketball team in the 1950's and coaches the boys to victory by "breaking them down first, and then building them up."not a bad subject. photography ok. but the plot is totally predictable. no real sub-plots. nothing added to make the movie exciting. you know what is going to happen from the very beginning. suitable for 4th graders.

a coach who used to be good, but has had to move to a new area to get away from what he once did; a team of no hopers; the star player who has a row with the coach; the assistant coach with an alcohol problem, the little guy who gets kicked around scoring the winning basket; the whole town against the coach (all except for the leading lady). it's the old story - right out of the british comic books, where a team of speccy geeks and fatties take on the brazilians at soccer and win.this film, admittedly well put together, is full of these clichés. the only part i didn't predict was when at the town meeting, the star player suddenly decided to side with the coach. no reason was ever given. it seemed like a very strange thing to do seeing that everything was going his way hitherto. maybe he just felt sorry for the poor guy.gene hackman plays a locker room popey doyle. i am sure that an actor of dennis hopper's calibre found nothing particularly challenging about his role. the same can be said about barbara hershey.all in all, a film full of clichés that might have been done a lot better than it was.

if anyone thinks this is a great sports movie it is probably the only sports movie they have ever seen. there are different aspects a sports movie can take. whether it be professional or college or high school. examples of sports movies i liked (and i haven't seen many) are jim thorpe: all american, all the right moves, any given sunday, eight men out, and rocky, among others. all of those movies had a little more than just plain sports. whether it was a mans ascent and then descent from greatness, or a man losing out on a dream by the actions of a vindictive coach, or the effect of money on professional sports. in hoosiers, there is not much content. it didn't even seem as though the movie had a beginning or an end. there was no character development, all of them were forced on us. i could sum up this movie, by quoting a very bad coach: "go out and try to score more points than the other guy."

being an american service member please believe me when i say that this movie in no way accurately portrays the emotional state of our soldiers/sailors/airmen/marines returning from deployments.that being said....this movie is one large steaming pile of cliché. the acting as awful (with the exception of the little girl) the character's backgrounds are weak and laughable, and plot is ludicrous.this movie is so bad i made an account with imdb just to warn anyone with half a brain away from it.canadian writer/director francesco lucente should be really, really, really ashamed of this movie. if he disagrees with us foreign policy, he should write a letter to the us government, not punish the entire english speaking world with a monumentally crap film.

in comparison to other "sand and sandal" fare, the egyptian leaves much to be desired. the film is very loosely based upon mika waltari's well researched novel, which centers around the egyptian physician sinhue's adventures at the court of akhnaton as well as his travels throughout canaan, minoan crete and africa. unfortunately, due to the moral strictures of the time, much of sinhue's story (which is rife with romantic and sexual exploits) remains on the cutting room floor and instead, the audience is treated to reels and reels of victor mature's wooden acting. even gene tierney  a leading lady "staple" of the time  can not manage to look nor act her best in this flick and gives a rather somnambulistic performance which can only be justified by the fact that the actress was having some serious psychiatric problems at the time. there is a great deal of rhetoric and theological machinations over the idea of monotheism vs. polytheism, but michael wilding is so tiring as the revolutionary akhnaton, that one is surely cheering for someone to off him and restore the old religion before the second reel. my advice: buy the book from e-bay, rent something more entertaining like solomon and sheba and then call it a night!

badland is one of the worst movies i ever seen. most of the time this is fine and i can go on with my life, but i feel the need to warn others in this case. as a veteran of the iraq war i feel it necessary to say that the story, plot, acting and depiction of what soldiers go through upon returning home was pure garbage. it was as if the director/writer/whoever latched on to whatever cliché about returning soldiers and ran with it and ran with it and ran with it..not to mention i would imagine there was absolutely no research put into this film. the "marine" uniform looked like it was fresh off a surplus store shelf and was a pattern not used since the first iraq war. i won't go on forever, this is a horrible movie. if you are interested in the stories of returning soldiers there are much better alternatives. i recommend going to your local library.

last night, i attended a screening of badland with my cousin. we were kind of excited to learn once we got there that the director/writer, the producer (his wife), and several cast members were also in attendance and that there would be a discussion and q&a after the movie. but once the movie was over and the credits started rolling (and the film really was not edited well enough and is too long), my cousin and i, without consulting each other, immediately got up and left. we found out once we started talking outside that we were both feeling so angry that not only did we not want to stay for the discussion, we couldn't even look at the cast and crew who had been standing near the exit and who we walked right by as we left.i have figured out that the roots of my anger were planted during the scene in which jerry slices his daughter celina's palm with a big knife so that her blood could be used to leave a fake trail. it was unavoidable to connect in my mind the physical pain he inflicted on her body with the emotional pain he inflicted on her spirit by murdering her mother and two brothers in her presence, sparing her, and taking her with him when he fled. i've sliced my palm before (accidentally); even a fairly superficial cut is incredibly painful because the palm is so sensitive, and it is very slow to heal if you don't keep it immobile because you just keep opening it up trying to go about your life. but after a very short time with only a narrow strip of cloth tied clumsily around her palm and one scene with a big band-aid, it was as if she'd never been cut. my anger reached its peak--i won't spoil this moment for you--in celina's final scene.i got angry because celina is by far the most sympathetic character in the film (the actress portraying her is a good one); i wasand you can't tell me a good screenwriter wouldn't know thisimmersed in feeling both her physical and emotional pain; and the screenwriter, by treating celina's emotional pain so cavalierly and with such disrespect, also treated me, the audience member, cavalierly and with utter disrespect.sure, the script has moments of tears for celina, and some dialogue that tells us she's hurting, somewhere, somehow. but by this time, we the audience are feeling so manipulated that we've shut down. the manipulation starts very early on in this movie, when jerry's family's dialogue spells out for the audience that jerry had psychiatric problems. rule one, screenwriters: give your audience some credit. let them do a good bit of the creative work on their own. tell the story; don't explain to us everything we're supposed to think and feel. we don't like it.my cousin also knew she was having trouble with the movie early on, dialogue-wise, when jerry and his wife had little to say to each other besides f*** this, f*** that, f*** you. some couples do indeed find themselves in relationships so bad that the f-bomb ends up being every other word out of their mouths. but it's like watching comedians who curse a lot. some of them are really funny; the cursing is ancillary. but some of them substitute cursing for humor, and this screenwriter, to carry the metaphor to its conclusion, is no chris rock.this husband and wife team bravely chose to tackle an awfully complex story with awfully complex characters. but they seem not to have realized that the meaning of a story, especially a complex one, will vary for each member of the audience. successful storytelling requires paying attention to important factual details, not working desperately to interpret the meaning of the story for the whole audience.i worked with vietnam veterans for five years, i've heard more stories than most, and i'm always happy to see films released that bring their stories to a broader audience. it's important, on all kinds of different levels, that we hear them. but i am less than thrilled that this storyteller decided before the film even began what jerry's story meant and proceeded to spell it out for us with a very heavy hand. next time, pay more attention to the details.

i'm assuming the filmmakers heart was in the right place but, frankly, this movie is truly unconscionable. i was offended by the tone and the total cop out ending. you cannot take issues like this so lightly! without knowing the final caveat of the movie... we watch as a guy guns down his 9 month pregnant wife and two sons and are supposed to follow him for the next 2+ hours as he tries to establish a new life?? you cannot have sympathy for a character who does this. cannot! not to mention, we're given nothing until the last say 1/2 hour of this unnecessarily long movie, as to why this guy is suffering so much. no flashbacks, no sudden reactions to noise or movement - stuff that real vets are suffering from. all we know is he has a pain in the ass wife and can't financially take care of her and his 3 kids. there really didn't seem to be any research whatsoever into what current iraq vets are going through.additionally, the movie suffers tremendously from a heavy handed and totally inappropriate score. its a catastrophe. it is truly harmful to some actually good acting on the part of the male lead and at times joe morton. it foreshadows everything you're supposed to feel, and sometimes gives you the wrong clues entirely! again, this was a brutal thing this guy did, and so seeing him get a new job, meet a new blonde, struggle behind the counter making toast is not appropriate! and really, the ending? what a freakin cop out! how dare you.there are far richer films dealing with the affects of war on returning soldiers, please don't bother with this one.

hi guys, this is my first review and i would had to have picked the worst movie to review. as i only watched 5 minutes of it but trust me you could see this movie was going nowhere. the acting was deplorable, the camera work and lighting looked as though it was shot and run by a pack of 10 year old's. no offence to 10 year olds.i just couldn't take anymore i got off my couch, took the the house of adam dvd out of the dvd player and threw it in the garbage. maybe if you are a colin farrell fan this movie may interest you, because the character in the movie, anthony, is a colin farrell look a like. but that is as far as it goes, he certainly will never have col's acting abilities. i gave this movie a rating of 1 (awful) only because there were no minuses in the drop down list cheers.

first and foremost i am a gay man, although do not live my life within the so called "community", and it's because of films like this that gay themed movies are not my favorite genre because 90% of them are crap. like this one. f i could give this a zero i would. (i do not understand all the positive comments, unless they were all made by people who made this film) i actually stopped this at the 24 minute mark when the so called straight "anthony" kissed adam outside the restaurant for no reason at all. and how is the son stealing from the diner if he doesn't even live in the town? wire transfers? the acting was horrendous! the sound editing? (listen to "anthony" and adam when they are sitting on the fence eating their lunch. every time the camera switched between the two so called actors the sound changes, like there was not a filter on the microphone)seriously do not rent, or god forbid, buy this movie.horrible horrible horrible acting and just a stupid storyline.

notwithstanding that "the house of adam" is meant to be a mainstream gay movie; that anthony (john shaw), who is gay curious and a major cutie-hunk and adam (jared cadwell) who is openly gay, and a close second in looks; that there is a whole minute of wonderful, convincing, and naked lovemaking (sorry, no frontal) between anthony and adam 41 minutes into the movie (that alone may be sufficient for many of us) --- notwithstanding all that (to which i give a thumbs up), "the house of adam" is a horrible movie by most any other movie making standard. a big thumbs down.shaw's and cadwell's acting abilities are either sophomoric or else truly suffer from the bad script, direction, and editing, or rather the lack thereof. their lovemaking scene is nevertheless convincing, and may have more to do with their really being into each other, considering the rest of their scripting and acting.writer-director jorge amer's (bonus feature) self-congratulation as to his movie making skills is off the wall.so, the script and lack thereof is a thumbs down. overall, the acting is thumbs down with just the slightest exception for shaw and cadwell. alexis karriker as nina might have been the best except for the limitations expressed above. far and away the absolute worst, and insufferable, acting was by thomas michael kappier as albert ross, anthony's father having not even of elementary school acting quality. he truly represents a colossal casting failure.the actors playing the new cabin owners are worthy of truly bad acting nominations as well.if only the production, editing and post production were as good as the trailer, this movie would have been quite something else. the trailer presents well put together clips of scenes that drew me into renting the movie in the first place. that, and the hope that this gay-centered movie, was supposedly prominently played and touted at gay film festivals.overall, the movie is a big thumbs down.is it worth buying/renting and watching it? only if you have an irresistible yen to see the naked love making scene, and a few minutes of semi-convincing dialogue between anthony and adam. or if you truly just enjoy watching bad movies.

corridors of blood aspect ratio: 1.66:1sound format: mono(black and white)london, 1840: whilst attempting to formulate an anaesthetic solution, a dedicated surgeon (boris karloff) becomes addicted to narcotics and is blackmailed by local bodysnatchers.riding the coat-tails of a gothic revival occasioned by the recent success of hammer's the curse of frankenstein (1957), robert day's corridors of blood is an odd mixture of historical drama and grand guignol theatrics. producer richard gordon lured karloff away from hollywood - where his movie career had become stalled in a b-movie rut (voodoo island, frankenstein 1970, etc.) - for a couple of lurid shockers in which good men are thwarted by circumstances beyond their control. in grip of the strangler (1958), he played a novelist who stumbles onto a horrific secret whilst researching a series of murders from recent history, while in corridors of blood, he's a drug-addicted surgeon who falls prey to a gang of criminals masterminded by east end pub landlord francis de wolff. less a horror film than a melodrama with ghoulish trimmings, the movie hedges its commercial bets by including a number of gory thrills (a leg sliced open, a face destroyed by acid, etc.), but the narrative is motivated chiefly by karloff's altruistic pursuit of an anaesthetic formula that will alleviate the terrible suffering of patients during surgery.produced under the title 'the doctor from seven dials', the finished movie went unreleased until 1962 due to indifference by distributors mgm, by which time co-star christopher lee had earned a prominent screen credit, despite playing a small - but significant - role as 'resurrection joe', a sinister cockney thug who murders carefully selected patrons of de wolff's squalid pub and sells the remains to local doctors. lee filmed this glorified cameo before the curse of frankenstein catapulted him to international stardom, which accounts for his limited screen time, though his intense performance is one of the film's highlights. adrienne corri (vampire circus) distinguishes herself as de wolff's partner in crime, and there's a feast of familiar faces in supporting roles, including francis matthews (dracula: prince of darkness), betta st. john (the city of the dead), finlay currie and nigel green. superb art direction (by anthony masters) and cinematography (geoffrey faithful).

simply put, i was amazingly disappointed. i'm a huge fan of asian horror, and i can watch unoriginality (i myself enjoyed "the red shoes" and "phone"), but this was just poor.the movie has a lot of elements that are very high-quality: the photography is eye-catching, the visuals are cool, the directing is inspired, the acting is pretty good, the music is easy on the ears, and the cgi is incredible. but, since this is a horror film, we are expected to be scared, which just won't happen with this film. as with most south korean horrors, this is unoriginal almost from beginning to end: there's the trademark long-haired vengeful female ghost, ominous clumps of thick, black hair and puddles of water, and near the end, a twist that *almost*, but not quite makes sense out of the whole thing (the twist is easily one of the best qualities). and to the viewer's irritation, when the film isn't recycling (at times, so exact that it could easily be dubbed plagiarized) imagery from other movies, it's making you jump. a lot. and by jumps, i don't mean things jumping out or anything, just very loud noises and screeches in the soundtrack used to make the audience jump six feet in the air (there's even a few "made-you-jump" moments that are simply infuriating). and when it is not ripping-off other movies, it's boring, and hard to sit through.and it's a shame, because "ryeong" could have easily been really good, and it has everything to make it good, but its the annoying overuse of completely predictable loud noises and jump scares that eventually ruin the movie. a perfect example of how good it could have been: there's a moment when one of out characters is looking at a corpse, and without a sound, the corpse looks back. it's wholly predictable, but the use of silence in that scene is brilliant. and unfortunately, that's as scary as the movie got for me.admittedly, "ryeong" has a few good features, and even a couple jumps that aren't as predictable, and do work. there's a very good and sad back-story used to explain the events, and the twist is pretty unpredictable. those are the only things that separate the film from any other asian ghost/horror film. but the problem with these is, even though they do work, they have been used before (j-horror fans will easily realize the big reveal was inspired by "a tale of two sisters"), and it takes the back-story a good fifty minutes to get going.so in the end, "ryong" really seems like a truly wasted opportunity. tae-kyeong kim hoped that the plot twist and other good features act as diversions, so the audience won't notice the huge flaws. but he failed, and well... we noticed everything.my rating: 4/10.

this movie starts out with this creepy song that gave me some chills like the song used in "nightmare on elmstreet"! it immediately sets the mood! the sequence that follows also shows what to expect! we are made aware that a ghost is present! the mystery concerning this ghost is what keeps this movie together! but the structure of the plot is so complex that it is difficult to make sense of it! the ideas behind the plot are quite interesting! only the way it is told to us is far too abstract! i understand that the director believed that he had to maintain the mystery as long as possible! the problem is that when certain matters get revealed you never get a satisfying explanation! the motives of the important characters are left out and some questions raised in the movie don't get answered at all! since we don't learn enough about the characters it becomes hard to care for them! and as a consequence you will loose interest! only some scares and a twist save this movie from becoming a total failure! the twist is interesting but no real shocker! the experienced viewer will see it coming! some reviewers complain that this movie is too much like "ringu" and is not original at all! well it is true that some of the effects and scares are borrowed from that movie! but there is a main difference! the suspense in "ringu" mainly was based on this one twist where the viewer finds out how the characters get killed!! in "ryeong" (the "ringu" like) twist is used as a creepy effect to accompany another crazy twist! "ryeong" heavily depends on a complex structured plot and twist that doesn't contain enough scares to hold your interest! simply put: this isn't a scary movie!

to call a film boring is not something i would usually count as a valid criticism. however, when a film is crassly made of spare parts from other films that weren't that good to begin with, and it is slow as molasses with no real payoff, i think it's fair to call a spade a spade. and the ghost is a very boring film.a movie that is about as original as its' name, the ghost tells the story of a young girl with amnesia being haunted by a ghost that holds the secret to her past. only, it's a whole lot more complicated and less interesting than one would think.the plot line is almost incomprehensible for most of the picture and the hook, the amnesia element, only makes things worse. it seems that no one, including the screenwriter and director have any clue what the hell is happening at any given moment. instead they chose to do what roughly amounts to the filmic equivalent of a sitcom clip show. there are scenes taken directly from ringu, dark water, shutter, the grudge series, and a smattering of pulse for good measure. making matters worse, the half dozen female leads all dress and read their lines alike, making them impossible to tell apart.there is just nothing to grasp onto with this film. the story isn't all that well thought out. the amnesia gimmick is lazy. the mystery element is un-involving and handled with little grace. the characters never deduce anything, all the information is just handed out through the lead remembering her past whenever it is convenient for the plot.the cinematography, full of reflections and shots of water at least attempts to add to the subtext, a thematic link with the amnesia and the final twist (which i won't reveal) is nice, but often overwrought. even the score feels borrowed and cliché.worst of all, the inciting action for the curse isn't very interesting and the final twist is predictable and lame. "wait, you mean that one character who has 15 minutes of screen time but appeared to have nothing to do with the plot comes back in the end? no!" audiences are too savvy for this kind of tripe. anyone who has seen any of the films that this rips off will find very little to even keep them awake with this feature. i used to think shimizu was the bottom of the barrel for this kind of crap (remaking his grudge film no less than 5 times) but even his second rate work like reincarnation, a film i couldn't even bring my self to finish, is miles ahead of this.for more reviews please visit www.collider.com

i am surprised that so many comments about this film are positive. having read the book several times (and all the other historical novels by mika waltari) there is no way to say much good in this film. if i forget the origins of the story i might consider it a reasonably good epic. of course to bring such a brick of a book to the big screen is a task not to be envied, but it could be done with class. i can't understand why even the name of nefernefernefer had to be shortened to just nefer. i love peter ustinov as kaptah and marlon brando probably would have made a better sinuhe but the overall attitude is too hollywood to ever make justice to the book. mind you mika waltari left the premier of this film in the middle of the showing. that's how much he liked it.

the authors know nothing about russians prisons, the movie is absolutely cockamamie, has nothing common with the reality. they also don't that the foreign prisoners in russia have a special prison so the foreigners never live together with russian criminals. the uniforms in this movie look if they were stolen somewhere in latin america. prisoners in russia also don't work outside the prison. each kill in russian prison is a subject of investigation so the prisoners kill each other only if there some very important reasons. playing soccer is also forbidden in the prisons, contacts between the prisoners are very restricted, no chance for bloody combats etc etc etc. so this movie has nothing common with the reality.

two things are changed from then.first of all i am not a kid anymore,and second most of new seagal movies are just terrible.this is on my opinion the worst movie ever made with derailed starred by jean claude van damme.there is no plot in this movie,the plot is just an excuse to shoot some terrible action scenes which are painful to watch.i love action movies,but this is not an action movie....this isn't a movie...this is a group of irritating scenes which are connected in annoying way to kill the viewers love for the action movies.i am sorry but i don't have any respect for anyone who liked this movie.he has a serious intelligence problem then.i hope that seagal will make some new good movies in the future.good luck for him !

why on earth does five us keep repeating this one? the title actually says it all: the plot is as clear as a book read in a language you never heard of and that resembles to nothing.you'll see ninety minutes of changing locations, most of them will be blown up later on in the movie. right in the beginning you see a nice little farm typical for the berry, which is in the movie moved close to paris but then it does not survive the "transport" to the isle de france very well: it explodes 1 minute later. there are also two gangster who have no tongues, as if that would make sense in the world of sms and internet, let alone pencil and paper.it just goes on like that, nothing makes sense in this story. my only credit goes to the cameraman, the camera is excellent.

i believe cockpuncher to be the best piece of work that has come out of the steven seagal factory in a long time. this movie was the first one i have seen since that fine film preview. my point? he is done. every movie is the same. maybe he will be good in machete because he won't be the star. we can only hope.p.s. thanks for speaking to ucsb when i went to college. it was an amazing speech. you really influenced some people out there.so i have to write ten lines about this movie? umm....i like the smoker guy who killed a bunch of fools. whenever anyone smells menthol's look out. because there could be a killer with a silenced glock (and another loud one) who wants to kill you.is that ten?

"the foreigner" is a tale of foreign intrigue with seagal at the center as a deep cover operative who has a package which everyone wants and are willing to kill to get. the flick is uninspired with less of the usual action stuff which put seagal on the movie map (fire fights, hand-to-hand combat, pyrotechnics, stunts, etc.) and more of a story which is convoluted, uninteresting, and full of meaningless filler. what action there is seems token and gratuitous while seagal, looking more and more like a pork chop, meanders through this insipid flick expressionless and bored while manifesting no improvement in acting ability. somewhere around "the glimmer man" or "fire down below" seagal flicks took a nose dive and "the foreigner" is just an continuation of that trend. nothing here worth watching except for the most die-hard seagal fans. (c-)

sigh... what can i say? why does a horrible script such as this gets approved in the first place. its not wrong to have a complicated plot but its not explained to the audience properly!to have the wife explain the plot via flashbacks is bad bad bad. to have such a tight editing for the fight scenes is bad too! such fanciful editing only appears in trailers. it cheapens the whole look!and who are the russian guys at the top of the movie? who is the guy being tortured? is he with the cia? this film deserved not to be released in theatre. but it doesn't deserve to be produced in the first place. its a joke to hollywood.

the cinemascope color cinematography of leon shamroy is quite remarkable here,including his use of colored filters forvarious scenes. the alfred newmann score has to be the most sensual and seductive score hollywood ever produced. it's a shame it is no longer available on cd. the actors, however, never rise to the occasion. the accents are so varied, from the subdued british of ustinov and purdom to the hollywood of baxter and mature that it seems a true hodgepodge with no central vision. tommy rettig is jarringly american. acting styles span the range from zombie-like to stilted. only ustinov as a conniving one-eyed servant steals the show - what there is of it to steal. the premise - the story of a young egyptian doctor, seduced and abandoned by the rich - and the parallel theme of the cult of the single god, ra - persecuted by the authorities, has its interesting points. but when the film's plot fades, it is the haunting music and visuals that remain.

i would like to comment on how the girls are chosen. why is that their are always more white women chosen then their are black women. every episode their is always more white women then black one's. as if to say white women are better looking then black women. i would like for once see more black women then white. and it not just your show it's like that in a lot of shows always more white's. but i would have thought since you as the head honcho of the show you would see this yourself and have more black women on your show. but you are just like the rest trying to act like you are so fair and nice. you are just a big fony hypocrite.

tyra & the rest of the modeling world needs to know that real women like myself and my daughter don't care to see all the ridiculous modeling to sell something. weird locations, too much makeup & too much skin is not necessary. sex does not always sell when you are selling to women. the same goes for the horse stomping runway walk that looks unnatural. people come in all shapes & sizes & they need to have that on the show. my daughter has a 36" inseam, is tall & slender & a size 5, i am more average at a size 12. we would like to see both- i can not picture how something would look on me when a size 2 is wearing it, it will not fit the same way on me. i do not buy magazines anymore because they are one sided on this matter. we would really love the show to consider women of all sizes. thank you.

in watching this off and on for a few seasons, two things come to mind: one - wondering what kind of girl wants to be a "model" and two - run to the nearest ice cream store and have a low fat sundae.i tried to be a fan because i liked the idea of this reality show competition. no other "famous" model thought of this, and it is very admirable for tyra banks to do so. but as the series goes on and on i've come to the conclusion that this is a sorry lot of folks trying to make a mountain out of a molehill. women shouldn't watch this, teens should stay clear of it unless they're doing book reports on the subject.many women try out for slots to compete for "americas next top model". they live together, cat fight together, cry together, get put through pointless modeling shoots with pointless modeling people and fashionatas and get eliminated and almost all of them claim, "you will see me again". heck, i'm trying to see what happened to the ones that did win, actually.this is the dream of some girls, and good for them. in watching this i hope the other girls that see this and run like hades the other way - like to college.i just happened to watch more of this recent season because of the "ploy" of full figured models joining the group. that even made me think more of this as a sorry lot of folks. the "full figured models" were no more than average sized ladies competing with what i think is the thinnest group of models they ever chose - so of course that would make them look even fatter - a "ploy" fashionatas use all the time. bad, bad, tyra and crew.but to be fair, "americas next top model" is not about "full figured" models, it's about projecting an imagined image a beauty that can be mass marketed and sold as the ultimate in beauty - and this show is just looking for the next fresh piece of meat to add to the mix. hence the name of the show. hence the sorry lot of judges, photographers, associations. hence tyra and her consistent "this was me" plugs every camera angle you can get. but then again, that is the one thing i like about this show - the ex-model giving others who wouldn't have the chance -- a chance to enter the doors. but after that...everything else is status quo for that industry which is why there are no surprises or week to week interest in the program.

tyra banks needs to teach these girls that it's not all about being beautiful on the outside. the inside counts for something too. a lot of the past winners have looked semi decent but are horribly cruel and starting trouble for the other girls. i see tyra less involved with the girls in every season. about the only thing worth watching top model for is mr. jay manuel. recently, tyra had a contestant who was a pre-op transsexual. i felt that she should have done more to encourage her. it was obvious that she had insecurities about her original anatomy showing through her feminine look. tyra should have given her tips or perhaps she could have sent resident trannie ms. jay to help the girl out. instead, the contestant was met with harsh criticism and not enough positive criticism. it's a shame because i truly enjoyed the first 3 seasons. there's a reason why project runway has all 4 seasons out on dvd and top model only has 1 season on dvd. it's called taste. top model seriously needs a lot of revamping an some more humanity.

this is by far the most vapid, idiotic, insanely stupid show that has ever been on the air, and this is coming from someone who remembers "san pedro beach bums".my wife loves watching reality shows--and there was one episode of this drivel where the wannabes had to develop a "walk". the end result was straight out of monty python's "ministry of silly walks" sketch. i couldn't laugh hard enough.and then there's the ubiquitous ms. banks (as in laughing all the way to the...). she has to be the most annoying self-important woman on tv since rosie o'donnell left "the view". as if modeling was doing great things for mankind. please. i've never found her attractive, and i don't find her intelligent now that she has the temerity to open her mouth.someone needs to tell these human clothes hangers to eat a healthy diet and actually look like real women.

i was wondering what possessed the organizers of the victoria film festival to include this film in their program. i guess they must have agreed with the others who have reviewed this film. i, on the other hand, consider it the worst film i have ever seen. it starts with a bad script, full of holes, and dialog so unlikely it's embarrassing. ideas are introduced, then dropped with no development. the acting left me totally cold and uninvolved. the set decoration was appropriate for the time, but a decorator's nightmare. the only way the characters could love this house is if their previous homes had been ghastly. the attic looked as if the items had been thrown in for the scene with no attempt to create the look of a real attic that has been filling with junk over the years. the photography was leaden and lacking in variety. save your money for something worthwhile.

this has got to be the worst show i have ever seen. i always liked chuck norris in films, but why do we need to make these shows politically correct by adding a black side kick who is as threatening as shirley temple in little miss marker. i also thought the show was limited because how many times can you kick a guy in the face and make it interesting. i know an african american who looks like this trivette guy and he gets his butt kicked about once a week he is all attitude.chuck norris is the man and he deserves all the kudos he gets, i think this show started great but lost steam as time went onthey should have dumped chucks side kick

i'd never thought that i would be caught saying this: but i think "dog the bounty hunter" is more entertaining than this 90's era cop drama. walker is very melodramatic and actually set a standard of the genre of "high octane" cop shows such as csi, csi: miami, and so forth. i'm not saying all these shows are bad, but they aren't good either. i like the karate chop action that walker dispenses on the enemies of justice, and the diverse cast of characters as much as the science tech of the csi series. but there are some elements that i hate in a show like this. stereotypes/countertypes! that's right, stereotypes/countertypes! unfortunately, this is a show for the moderates of red state america who refuse to part with the old prejudices of yore especially when it comes to crime. for example, there was an episode in which a kid with psychic powers ventures into dallas where he encounters group of kids in goth/punk clothing and they start harassing him. now! this is exactly what middle america perceives the goth/punk culture. i mean come on, how often do people that dress like that rob and steal from people just minding there own business. whenever there are blacks and latinos in the plot it's always about gangs in some impoverished neighborhood. okay! not everyone who's a minority is a desperate recruit of a gang surrounded by crime, drugs, poverty. again, this is what middle red state america sees of these people. finally, why is the trivette the bumbling sidekick, can't you make the sidekick an equal ass-kicker?

tamara anderson and her family are moving once again, as her itinerant painter father chases his next landscape. fifteen years old, she is in her rebellious stage. already angry at her father for their frequent relocations, her anger is exacerbated when her mother is suddenly confined to a sanatorium for tuberculosis. her mother's absence causes tamara to lash out at her father and seek comfort in religion, the boy next door, rusty, as well as the spirit of the dead teenager who used to live in her rented house.the story is modest to a fault. it's oddly paced, and even during its emotional scenes there isn't any tension. the actors portraying the parents are fine. alberta watson is incredibly charismatic as the sick mother, and maria ricossa is particularly effective as the guilt-ridden mother of the dead teenager. but katie boland, as tamara, is too amateurish to carry the movie. the dialog is very natural and boland can't quite pull it off. she has her moments and when she hits them she can be good but there were too many times when she came off awkward. one can see her thinking 'ok this is what my line is and this is the face i'm supposed to make' rather than actually reacting to the other actors. she's not the only one, kevin zegers as rusty and megan park as his sister brenda also suffer from stilted delivery but at least they're in fewer scenes.if done right, the screenplay could have made her an affecting movie. and it has it moments but much of it is bogged down with an amateurish lead performance and flat directing.

this series is formulaic and boring. the episodes are the same thing every week, simply with slightly varied settings. some purely evil character does some dastardly deed, walker goes after him, and it ends in a karate match. the villains are super-cliché super-stereotypical evil villains, the good guys are all pure, honest and saintly, and the story lines are simplistic and unrealistic. after about 2 episodes, the show becomes totally unwatchable by all but the least discerning fans. certainly not norris's best work. his other work may be cliché but it usually does not drag on for weeks. if you enjoy formulaic,boring, repetitive clichéd snooze-fests, then this is for you.

walker texas ranger is one of the worst shows produced in the past 10 years. the script for james 'jimmy' trivette, walker's sidekick, is about as pathetically written of a part as wesley crusher on star trek tng, and is played with about as much conviction.on this show, people don't respond the way people respond to things in real life--everyone is polarized--everyone is either a completely good guy or a completely bad guy (unless walker himself has a 2 minute talk with them and then they change instantly). that's not how life works, that's not how people are. this show doesn't take place in this reality.the plot lines are about as realistic as murder she wrote, a show where an arrogant old lady can just walk into people's houses without them getting angry, and she can demand that police officers do what she wants and they bend over backwards for her. with walker, everyone on the show, including the "bad guys", act like he's the sort of hero that myths and fairy tales are made of, and time itself bends to his whim. the lines that sometimes come out of people's mouths on this show are beyond ridiculous. it's as if the scriptwriter for the part of wesley crusher (for the "serious" parts) and the scriptwriter for bob saget's funniest home videos (for the "humor" parts) got together and wrote all the scripts for this show.this show is for people who think that good always prevails over evil. it's for the elderly. it's for wishful thinkers. it's for people who want to be guaranteed to always have a happy ending. it's for people who want to drift away into oblivion. it's for people whose drug of choice is their television.i cringe every time i see even a commercial for this show. my opinion is that it is the worst show to be on television in the last 10 years.i used to like chuck norris, but this show has forever tainted him in my mind. i can't even watch his older movies without thinking of this show.

this tv show is possibly the most pathetic display of crap on tv today. horribly predictable, obscene usage of slow motion photography, cheesy story lines. chuck norris is an abomination who should never have been allowed to be filmed in anything. the way he chooses to make each episode into a public service announcement is really annoying. his acting sucks so bad that it makes a person cringe with embarrassment. i will give the series some credit though...it does get entertaining at times, but not enough for it make any difference. with all the negative points this series has, i still prefer it over reality tv, it can't really get any more worthless than that.

this show is the worst show ever! norris and his family write it, produce it, direct it, etc etc. the only reason i ever see it is because my goofy wife likes it. how many times can norris fly though the air from plain sight to land a kick on an obviously blind villain? no trees, no building, just whoosh.....thin air. he always solves the case or is the best at whatever skill there is. no co star ever gets the glory. its all norris. its truly apparent that norris is awful stuck on himself and will not allow anyone to one up him in any scene no matter what the content. terrible acting, terrible script, terrible series.

the director seems like a good, solid man. his parents struggle with the same issues we all cope with. they strayed from each other. they loved each other. they misunderstood each other. and the poor audience has to sit through ninety minutes of what is possibly the trials and tribulations of one of the most boring families ever to come out of long island.there are few interesting choices in this documentary--the music is banal, the filming uninspired, and the story is the same story that has played out on every birch street in every town in america. i don't mean to sound too harsh--seldom has a sweeter, more well-intentioned documentary been made. the director is the kind of man with whom you'd want to be friends. you just wish he had struggled as much presenting the material as his parents did keeping their marriage alive.

this documentary is rife with problems.how arrogant is it to make a documentary about your own family? i understand you think the subject is interesting. i was bored with it. this isn't a fascinating story to me, and i don't know why you would think it was.i don't want to come off as mean, but i have to say: most of the people in this film are just not attractive. and that's ok, not everyone is pretty. but your camera technique, to stick the lens in their face so you can't help but be overwhelmed by their unpleasant appearance because it is filling your 47" tv, is not enjoyable. i had to put my hand up half the time to shield myself from the warts, wrinkles, bags under eyes and yellow teeth. really, i'm trying not to sound inhuman, but pull the camera back so its not like total strangers are breathing in my face.the camera work in this "film" is rank amateur level. it's the kind of camera work you see from everyone with a camcorder at a family picnic. uninteresting framing, unsteady, even static shots are done carelessly. put a little effort into it, if you're going to do this for a living.i honestly can't see what the big deal is about this thing.

after seeing the movie, i feel the father and the mother are both reasonable person, although not perfect at all. on the contrary, i don't like the author, and his two sisters.is a person's journal an accurate portrait of herself? no. most of time people only write problems in her journal because she want to solve the problem. so a journal is always a more negative side of a person. in this movie, the author judge his mother's life by her journal. not a wise choice.the author's elder sister is so ugly, external and internal. first, she said her father's second marriage is "not fair" for her mother. then, she said she doesn't love her mother. so, she don't love both father and mother. i doubt she love anybody in the world. her face is so ugly, just a reflection of her heart. through out the movie, i feel the author and his sisters are lack of love and respect to their parents. however, i feel the father are mother are very loving to their children, even the author try to portrait them as cold, deceitful person.

the film's title makes it sound like a porno but it's not even a sex comedy. instead, hot summer in barefoot county is about an official sent from a southern state to a small town to locate and arrest moonshiners. the moonshine though is coming from the farm of an old woman with three beautiful daughters. almost anyone can guess what happens next but oddly, the film is very tame. it hardly even qualifies for a pg rating. what's more, the low budget is obvious in pretty much every shot and the acting is sooooo amateurish. this film was probably intended for the drive-in crowd but it's unlikely that it satisfied them, even in 1974.

'nuff said. an undercover cop from the state capital is sent to a small county where moonshine running is rampant. he ends up getting run off the road by some local hicks who have no idea he's an undercover cop (so they just drive away as blissfully dopey as ever). he is soon being taken care of by a woman and her three daughters who all wear low-cut tops and short shorts (gotta luv the '70s). he falls in love with one of the girls but in the meantime he still has to find out who's making all the moonshine and driving it to all the local bars and restaurants. he also has to contend with a fat sheriff and his incompetent deputy who think he's the moonshiner 'cause he's new in town.life in small town america, 70s style. yee haaaaaaaaaaa.

one of the most pleasant surprises of this early 3-strip technicolor short was that a ballet dancer that appears here was named maria gambarelli! i half wondered if blake edwards was naming the character played by elke sommer in a shot in the dark after this now-forgotten performer (though the spelling of the sommer character's surname was actually gambrelli). i watched this on youtube mainly to see an early judy garland appearance as we watch her in profile with her two older sisters singing "la cucaracha". that was the highlight for me which otherwise showed some dances (like that of ms. gambarelli) that were enjoyable and some lame comedy between andy devine as a great bull-fighter (yeah, right!) and buster keaton as a bull owner who provides one that is obviously a man in animal costume. only funny part of those two is when they cry-with buster providing handkerchief to "bull"-during the sad part of "la cucaracha". also lame was seeing ted healy without his stooges dealing with a crasher who keeps mistaking healy for other movie stars. (healy himself didn't know zeppo had left the marx brothers since he puts "four" between "the" and "marx"!) speaking of a marx, it was interesting seeing harpo without his wig though he is wearing a hat to hide his bald head. also interesting was seeing ida lupino among the cowgirls in the beginning though i also recognized toby wing from her part in murder at the vanities last year (at least when announcer pete smith identified her). oh, and smith himself wasn't funny with his wise-guy narration. other famous stars you may or may not recognize are also in cameos and not all are m-g-m contract players either! so with all that said, la fiesta de santa barbara is worth a look for anyone curious about judy garland's early film appearances or the early use of 3-strip technicolor.

when i was 13 or so i was lucky enough to find this film. it was part of an endless danish series of really cheesy stuff. this however was the cheesiest i ever owned - but i guess i sold it, too bad. well what to write... better than "manos: the hands of fate" and worse than "critters 4". but it's definitely worth an hour and a half since this was made by people who wanted to make it. the acting isn't that terrible compared to several other eighties trash - in fact i kind of like the old man even though he did'nwt look that indian to me. but i guess you can't have everything... do yourselves a favour and look this up...

it didn't take too long after halloween had kicked off the slasher boom for the category to be cursed by continuous mediocrity. as early as 1983 the genre was already struggling to release more than three decent offerings per year and by '88 the stalk and slash flick had become pretty much the whipping boy of horror cinema. by that time major studios were all aware that repeating the tired formula was no longer a lucrative direction, which left it up to independent and mostly inexperienced filmmakers to continue the legacy that john carpenter had created. although there was still an impressive number of features hitting shelves in 88, most of them were weakly produced and taken as a whole they were eminently unappealing. with that said there were a couple of gems amongst the rubble. scott spiegel's intruder in its uncut form was a superb gross out classic, whilst evil dead trap proved that the cycle had not yet completely run out of style and panache. william lustig's maniac cop was successful enough to launch a franchise and two years later dead girls and mirage proved to be the last beguiling breaths of life in the ailing category.it was the continual release of schlock like berserker, blood lake and rush week that cursed the slasher movie to eight years of obscurity. it finally took the big budgeted flamboyance of wes craven's scream to provide the necessary resuscitation. having not heard anything about demon warrior before i came across it unexpectedly, i instantly assumed that it was part of the low brow trash that led to the downfall of the slasher phase. but with that said the movie boasts an intriguing premise that sits comfortably beside scalps and camping del terrore as another welcome addition to the native-american influenced catalogue.a truck pulls up on a woodland road and out step two laughably dramatised rednecks. the hillbilly lumberjacks are only on screen for around for ten seconds and then they are murdered by an unseen menace. next we meet a troupe of five young adults that are heading to the same location for a spot of shotgun-target-practice on some of the local wildlife. the area is owned by neil willard and has been passed down through three generations of his family. his grandfather stole the land from an indian medicine man that was rumoured to have left a curse on the property. according to legend, every ten years a demon warrior with an extreme hatred for mankind stalks the forest reaping revenge on those he deems responsible for the pilfering of the tribe's home. it wouldn't be much fun if those myths were a falsehood, so regular as clockwork a maniacal assassin turns up with a taste for blood. will the kids be able to stop this phantom killer?demon warrior is best described as a bigger budgeted (but still woefully cheap) re-imaging of fred olen ray's scalps. the bogeymen from both films are virtually identical and the director even throws in a scalping sequence to confirm my suspicions. things start promisingly with some crisp friday the 13th-style first-person cinematography and a couple of shock-jolts that were composed with finesse by director frank patterson. thomas callaway did a good job with the photography and the tribal-drum score makes a refreshing change from the more traditional late-eighties synthesizer rubbish. flourishes of suspense are juxtaposed with a couple of credible directorial embellishments and there are even a few attempts at humour. the killer looked successfully creepy in demon attire and the inclusion of a bow and arrow as the main murder weapon was a deft touch from the director.fred olen ray's notorious slasher was notable for its stark and credibly unsettling atmosphere. unfortunately despite being produced on twice the budget, demon warrior never comes close to the film that it so desperately emulates. rumor has it that the majority of the actors were drafted from the texas baylor university and were not even paid for their inclusion in the feature, so of course it goes without saying that the dramatics are appropriately abysmal. i especially enjoyed the hilarious john langione  an 'italian' native american (don't ask) that portrays about as much emotion as the trees in the forest that surrounded him. warrior started with some credible glimpses of panache from the director that actually led me to believe that this could be a welcome inclusion to the slasher index. unfortunately, the poisonous cocktail of heinous acting and an ending plucked directly from stupidsville seriously changed the initial plan i had in mind for a rating. it's a shame that the dramatics were so scraped from the bottom of the thespian barrel, because at times demon warrior showed flashes of potential.all in all, patterson's movie is a mixed bag of ideas  some of them were good, but mostly they were staggeringly mediocre. because this was released at a time when the slasher genre had been watered down to avoid the scissor happy censors, there's really no gore worth mentioning. even the scalping sequence is relatively tame compared to olen ray's graphic depiction. demon warrior has the odd moment of credibility, but not often enough to warrant a purchase. not as bad as the aforementioned berserker, blood lake et al, but not really that good either..

i like a lot of myrna loy movies. this film was produced before her character actor personality was developed. it would be an okay short film but seems to go on forever in it's complete form.myrna loy it seems is told what to do with her acting and does the job. that is about all you can say about her.her gypsy character is shoddy and the film has many flaws, such as the jewelry shop scene.this film will probably be interesting to myrna loy fans but even as such is something of a disappointment.

into a happy household comes the gypsy girl, played by myrna loy. with her amazingly wild hair and voice that sounds very high-pitched and weird, it's hard to believe this is loy!! she bears no similarity whatsoever to the refined and funny character nora charles who she played in the thin man movies. instead, she overacts so badly that you'd almost expect her to be in an ed wood movie. what a huge difference a few years made in the quality films she got as well as her acting ability!! on top of the horrendously silly character, the film also fails because it just isn't interesting or exciting--just very, very stagy and stupid. the only thing good about it is the vitaphone sound system--making the sound quality of this turkey about the best i have heard from 1929. heck, it was even better than most 1930 films, so the sound technician at least has something to be proud of--all others, forget it.this is a movie that even the host of turner classic movies referred to as a "guilty pleasure" because the movie is so bad! and, after having seen it i disagree...slightly. the movie is simply bad.

i wish i could find some good things to say about this animated sequel(but not really a sequel)to "atlantis:the lost empire"but this would be a very short comment.the magic that the first one had is nowhere to be found here.the animation is pretty poor all over,the characters themselves are not very well drawn.the backgrounds and the foregrounds are also not good.there's very little attention to detail here.and instead of a compelling and engaging story,we have 3 short stories which are boring and don't make a lot of sense.i swear,even the characters sounded like they were bored,and would rather be somewhere else.which says that the voice actors were bored and wanted to be someplace else,at least that's the impression.some of the same actors return for this dismal effort,but an integral par of the success of the first one was michael j.fox as the main hero, milo thatch.i get the distinct impression this movie was just thrown together to capitalize on the success of the first one,without much thought or care.but at least cree summer returns as the voice of "kida".that's probably the only good thing about this movie,and even she doesn't seem to have her heart completely in it.mind you,i guess you couldn't blame any of the cast for not giving their all,considering what they had to work with.or rather not work with.this is a straight to video movie(and i use the term loosely)which should have went straight to the nearest landfill.anyway,shame on disney.consumers deserve much better than this.this one gets a 0/10 and a well deserved one at that.p.u

what the (beep) is going wrong with disney the last years? are there totally run out of good ideas? where is the magic? where are the good animators, the good songwriters, the good directors, the good... okay, i know, walt himself and the famous "nine old man" can't come back. but is this a reason to crank out countless of those cheap sequels and slowly but surely destroying the ideals of walt disney? i never rent or bought a disney-sequel of what movie however. because i had read much enough about its (absence of) quality. but "atlantis: milo's return" was aired today on tv in germany and so i watch it. it confirmed my doubts about sequels. it was absolutely boring. flaw animation, primitive color-rotation, simple characters, some unsuccessful tries to simulate the famous multiplane-camera with cgi, mediocre music and a patchwork of different, simple stories. it looks absolutely not like disney! not like disney i know! it looks like one of the countless, cheap and simple animation-series like "dragonballz", "beyblade" etc. that aired every day on tv for children.my first reaction after showing this crap, was to load "bambi" in my dvd-player, to see disney's immortal magic, depth, spirit and charm again, to see disney on its climax again, to see the awesome art of handmade animation again. "bambi" was the first (and until today the only) movie that i give 10 out of 10 stars. but "atlantis: milo's return"? no magic, no depth, no charm, no spirit... it deserved only 3 out of 10!

when i put this movie in my dvd player, and sat down with a coke and some chips, i had some expectations. i was hoping that this movie would contain some of the strong-points of the first movie: awsome animation, good flowing story, excellent voice cast, funny comedy and a kick-ass soundtrack. but, to my disappointment, not any of this is to be found in atlantis: milo's return. had i read some reviews first, i might not have been so let down. the following paragraph will be directed to those who have seen the first movie, and who enjoyed it primarily for the points mentioned.when the first scene appears, your in for a shock if you just picked atlantis: milo's return from the display-case at your local videoshop (or whatever), and had the expectations i had. the music feels as a bad imitation of the first movie, and the voice cast has been replaced by a not so fitting one. (with the exception of a few characters, like the voice of sweet). the actual drawings isnt that bad, but the animation in particular is a sad sight. the storyline is also pretty weak, as its more like three episodes of schooby-doo than the single adventurous story we got the last time. but dont misunderstand, it's not very good schooby-doo episodes. i didnt laugh a single time, although i might have sniggered once or twice.to the audience who haven't seen the first movie, or don't especially care for a similar sequel, here is a fast review of this movie as a stand-alone product: if you liked schooby-doo, you might like this movie. if you didn't, you could still enjoy this movie if you have nothing else to do. and i suspect it might be a good kids movie, but i wouldn't know. it might have been better if milo's return had been a three-episode series on a cartoon channel, or on breakfast tv.

because disney more often than not, ignores the animation quality and a need for a good plot in their sequels, this was actually a nice surprise. i don't know why disney does not pay more attention to their sequels. the graphics quality is always inferior; no backgrounds worthy of the name disney, inane plots, and worse dialog, with little or no attention given to the actual story, and the caricature drawings are almost always worse than saturday morning cartoons in detail and quality.the animation quality is still poor when compared to disney originals, and the dialog is quite trite, the story line and overall execution was really quite enjoyable. while it is not as captivating, it does not completely fail to capture the charm and/or mystery from the first. there is some hint of it, tucked away here and there.the children will like it, at any rate.it rates a 4.5/10 from...the fiend :.

i will not say much about this film, because there is not much to say, because there is not much there to talk about. the only good thing about this movie is that our favorite characters from "atlantis: the lost empire" are back. several of the bad things about this movie are that it has horrible characters, it has horrible comedy, horrible animation, and james arnold taylor trying to copy the wonderful, one and only michael j. fox as milo james thatch. the reasons for my criticisms are that all the characters are changed into something that they never were, and never should be, animation that has been downgraded to the lowest extent possible, and finally, why would somebody who did wonderful voice-over work for obi-wan kenobi in "clone wars" want to copy michael j. fox? i happen to have an answer to this. because they are the same person who thought he had to copy eddie murphy from mulan in mulan ii. yes, sadly, it is true..

if you've seen atlantis 1, then you'd know that what made that film truly great was brilliant animation and a good script. this movie was so sloppily drawn and animated. the story is also dopey. i was so disappointed in this half-baked drivel that i couldn't make it past the first hour, and man did i try! the one thing this film had was that it expanded the "mole" character, making him both more sympathetic and three dimensional. take it from me, judge this junk from the cover on the video box. the cover is poorly drawn disney schlock, clearly grabbing for an easy buck from an unsuspecting parent. if this was a stand alone flick, it wouldn't be so bad, but riding on the coattails of a brilliant piece like atlantis makes it utterly inexcuseable.

well,there isnt much to say about this movie. its simply trash. very poor acting, poor script, and lame story.... well, the actress,(i odnt even know her name) who played mainrole,(not the blond one,but latina one) was acting fine,but the blond one who played the friend of main charactor,,,her acting level is just like highschool play,so as most of other actors in the movie. also,zombies,,,,very bad acting as well. and,,the story itself has really no point at all. well, if you are really bored and really got nothing to do,but wanna kill time somehow, maybe you may wanna watch this movie,but eventho,there are still millions of better b movies than this crap. its total waste of money and time.

very simply, they are all the syndicated episodes and not the original uncut/unedited nbc episodes. it is not the complete first season, all eps are edited to conform to 21:00 for syndication meaning jokes are cut, an extra commercial fade is included, all of the harvey korman intros are not here...very poorly done! shame on a series i've been waiting for....booooooooooooooooo! if you're a true die hard mama fan, don't buy this and go to http://www2.warnerbros.com/web/main/help/whv/customer_service.jsp and send them comments on why we're unhappy on this butcher job to a classic sitcom!

this guy is a real piece of work. an angry, immature boy in a grown man's body, packing all the charisma of a rock, he goes around to places most people would only wish to visit and does his best to be as miserable as possible.give this job to someone else who actually appreciates it.i could go down an endless list of all the stupid things this guy does in his "episodes," though i'll just highlight the worst: crete. while the locals are putting up seaside picnics in his "honour," this clown has the gall to act like a petulant, spoiled child. he complains about everything, including the fashion sense of the people who live there. what an imbecile.when he went to sweden, he spent at least five minutes feigning incredulity at a bunch of chefs (who probably had better things to do than talk with some dimwit american, like work) because they didn't think abba was horrible. everywhere he went, he brought up abba. this is the kind of talk you'd hear from 13-year-olds who watch too much mtv.when he was in new orleans, he got upset that a certain restaurant had better-tasting fries than his, so he "accidentally" spilled some wine on them in order to ruin them. what a strange, emotionally unstable person.the worst of it all are his clumsy voice-overs, where he attempts in vain to add some kind of perspective on a situation he was too thick and ignorant to appreciate. he tries to use all these "big" words in order to sound like an author, but he's really just a pretentious hack whose lack of awareness has convinced him he has something to say. that, by the way, is probably the one good thing about this joker's tv show. it goes to show you, no matter how inept you are, as long as you take yourself seriously enough, the world will as well.then there's the way he speaks with local guides whose english is obviously only rudimentary. he'll use vocabulary any writer--as he believes himself to be--would instinctively know will most likely not be understood by these people. does he care? no. self-important schmucks like this bourdain clown do not use language to communicate; they use it to make themselves look important.mcg13jthm's review on this same page is a perfect example of the kind of mind bourdain attracts--that of a low iq social misfit. observe how the reviewer attempts to justify bourdain's sociopath nature with simple-minded, childish excuses that hardly make sense. "bourdain may complain but he goes through 'a lot' and, not only that, he was 'forced' to do this show but is trying to redeem himself." a dolt attracts dolts, and reading mcg13jthm's review should let you know perfectly well whether or not you are the kind of person who'd enjoy this utterly useless, pointless show.finally, to add a bit of "fairness" to my diatribe, i admit bourdain would have been momentarily amusing had i met him in a bar. but as a tv host of a travel show whose purpose is to show the viewer the beauty of other places and cultures, bourdain is a miserable, abject, hopeless, grim and depressing failure.a failure.

a man wonders if his hunky co-worker is gay. at a yard sale he finds a ray gun called "gaydar". you point it at a person, pull the trigger and it tells you how gay they are. he tries it out, it works and he sets out to find out if his coworker is gay like him...promising idea ruined by an unfunny script (after a promising beginning) and terrible acting. the entire cast overacts and basically scream their lines at each other constantly. it gets annoying and really embarassing after a while. the saving grace is that's it is short, there's a scene stealing cat (love her fall out of the kitty bed) and charles nelson reilly is hysterical in his brief bit. but none of this saves the movie. i can't recommend this at all.

the fun that was present in the other 'movies' has all but disappeared with this third effort, which means the rubbishy production values show through more than ever. another 2-parter ('the chinese web') cobbled together, this one suffers from too much padding, not to mention weak spidey action taking place in such uninspired locations as a car park, apartment and printing press. nicholas hammond is as endearing as ever, struggling valiantly against the drab production and lame performances of the rest of the cast. the plot, in which peter and spidey help a chinese official defeat charge of corruption during world war ii by locating three marines who could testify as to his innocence, doesn't exactly scream 'comic book sprung to life', does it?

the film starts out great, with a mock instruction film about the habits of swedish housewives. after that we get a detailed reconstruction of post-war scandinavia with lots of amazing cars, electronic equipment and interior design; a minimal jazz score, nice cinematography and stylish titling. also there's some funny scandinivian rivalry like in von triers 'riget'.sadly, after the set up, "kitchen stories" collapses like the twin towers on 9/11.actors who try to portray the emotion 'jealousy" by just staring in front of them. corny dialog filled with stale gay symbolism in the vain of: "i don't like white swans, i prefer bears and wolves... u ever tasted bear meat?" the music becomes cheesier than yann tiersen at his worst.it's a pity the director put all the effort in this great set-up, just to screw it up after-wards.

first, let me mention the fact that, in spite of its title («stories», in plural), there is only one kitchen story. as to whether isak died or not at the end, i'm not so sure since, in one of the very last scenes, his pipe is seen lying on the table next to the two cups. on the dvd cover, there is a reference to tati. it claims that the film is «très drôle: rappelle tati !» («very funny: reminiscent of tati!». the great jacques tati relied mainly on mime and silent deadpan attitudes to achieve his comical effects and to offer his critically satiric views of his 1950’s french «modern» society. of course «kitchen» does take place during the 1950’s and it does offer some (rather faint) satirical references to the absurdities of bureaucracy and there are some long moments were no words are uttered -– but they are not really funny. are all these small details enough to make «kitchen» a «tatiesque» movie ? this being said, i have to admit that «kitchen» does deal with the sometimes false objectivity of scientific research versus the «truth» of human subjective emotions. generally speaking, the movie was agonizingly slow, with nothing much happening -- with barely any «dramatic impulse» : the involving parts were the set up during the first 15 minutes or so, and during the last half hour or so. indeed, the last segment was -- finally !!! -- interesting and moving. it might seem that it was a short subject, of less than an hour, unduly stretched to some 90 minutes. now, about the set-up (a «scientific» observation on the behavior of single males in their kitchen): at first it seemed very promising –- with the charting out of the comings and goings of bachelors in their kitchen as a means to determine what new inventions would be most useful to come up with. but very quickly this premise turned out to be just a prologue, an «excuse» to introduce the real subject which was only fully developed towards the end and which was about loneliness and the invaluable bond of friendship. pity ! i honestly wanted to like that movie. yes, it seemed so promising when i heard about some of its unusual little «anecdotes» -- which were indeed there and which i enjoyed -– such as the burning of a man’s nose hair (instead of using scissors to cut it off), the «investment» of having a huge quantity of «valuable» black pepper stacked away in a barn, the role reversals (the observant becoming the observed), a man’s mouth emitting sounds from a radio program. and there is also a sick horse becoming the catalyst of half-hidden human despair, the relative importance of right or left side car driving in sweden and norway (a reflection of the importance for each of these very close neighboring countries to affirm its individuality ?). am i the sole person who did not fully enjoy that film ? does this necessarily mean that i'm wrong ? perhaps it’s almost generally praised «fine points» were, in fact, «too subtle» for me ? perhaps... could my individual views on this movie ironically reflect the very essence of the film itself -- which would be the vital necessity to have the right to differ, to affirm one’s individuality and not to follow blindly society’s trends and opinions ? each one of us has the right to have different personal views and not to be a slave of the demands of one’s bread-winning «dictatorial» demands: often, we do have other alternatives that would allow each one of us to be useful to our society while respecting one’s inner principles. in short, being true to oneself -– the way that in that film folke (isak’s «scientific observer») ends up by giving up his job while preferring to stay in his new friend isak’s house and help his out with the tasks of his farm ... and so, «vive la différence», as the french say !

is it just me or the fact that the evil racing team is japanese and that their arrogant star racer is german seem a little over the top? maybe that is how it is on the international racing circuit but if all america had representing them are chumps like cody and his mechanic chris (peter berg, who must have been still learning how to act) then i would be rooting for another country. formula movies can be good but the characters have to be likeable and no one meets that criteria in this movie. to put it succinctly - a very bad movie.

what a dire film. i cannot believe that i actually sat down and watched it. a very, very, very, very, very, very pathetic effort, with no redeeming features whatsoever. hateeeeeeedddd ittttt! the so-called "racing" sequences are laughably awful, and the plot was so bad, i've forgotten it. part of the film was made at the spa-francorchamps course in belgium in, i think, 1988, during the actual grand prix there. i was there and am glad i didn't appear in any of the paddock scenes shown in the film. it could have been good...what a pity.

i love the book. it's full of passion, romance, tension... and the movie drags along taking two spunky stars with it. kylie minogue was already a major star in australia, having starred in neighbours and releasing her first single. the decision to cast her in the delinquents was surely a marketing ploy. for me, it didn't pay off.kylie may have been great in neighbours, but she was far too sweet and innocent to play the feisty lola... and, she wasn't of asian descent as lola was. charlie schlatter was an excellent brownie, but there was no chemistry between him and kylie.by and large, the movie was boring. it dragged on, it lacked the passion of the book, it focused heavily on kylie and in general, was completely disappointing.

i was living in barstow ca. in 1968 when the movie the killers three arrived at the local theater. the trailer was enough to get me to pay my hard earned money to see this movie. i was really expecting a bonnie and clyde movie and i got dick clark playing a shy nerdy guy while robert walker and diane varsi played an poor attempt of reinacting bonnie and clyde. needless to say it never went over well. maybe this is why it never made it to video. even as a kid i was left some what ripped off as i left the theater. after all the best parts where in the trailer of the movie. the movie was dull and pretty much pointless. by the way, dick clark gets killed so it wasn't a total let down.

this film was shot in randolph county in central north carolina in 1968 when a film crew in the state was a rare thing. the locations were the municipalities of liberty and ramseur and the surrounding rural countryside. it is not a particularly good movie. it did have merle haggard and it brought life to the hinterlands for a few minutes.the plot is standard shootemup. the cinematography is that fuzzy stuff that came out of the late sixties and early seventies. the local folks were thrilled to be a part of the enterprise.if viewers have difficulty finding a copy of this film, a record copy is available in asheboro, nc.actors not credited include ben jones, mimi pravda, tommy hull, bill nunnery.

i am shocked by all the good reviews on the cover of this movie and on imdb. it belongs in the $2 bin at your local video store. to say that this is a b movie is extremely generous.besides lacking a single redeemable character, only slightly better than average acting, and an ugly 80's style picture quality, the script for this film is dull and lifeless. this film is not only boring--it is pathetic. (admittedly, there is occasionally some mildly interesting chemistry between the two main characters.) even the final plot twist--rather, the only plot twist--does not save this film.rent "diamond men" if you must, but do not hesitate to turn it off once you become appraised of its worthlessness. 2 out of 10.

man alive, is this game bad or what? the graphics are way below par, even if it were on a playstation 1, never mind a gamecube. the gameplay is pathetic and the camera movements disorientating. what a worthless game!i totally love warner's batman animation and it's cool that they do all the games in this way. batman: vengeance could well have turned out great as they got off to a good start by keeping all the gothic visuals and voice actors but they seriously stumbled when it came to playability and graphics. the result is a boring game that looks incredibly cheap and is no fun to play whatsoever. i really must stress how bad the graphics are. don't let the color schemes fool you. i've seen better stuff on a commodore 64.

was the cast and crew on drugs before they started filming this? there was a hole in the plot...so big...nothing could have filled it up. from the first scene when the co-star is late for dinner, was there any doubt where he was and what he had just done? the suspense was over from there. now, it was going to take another 85 minutes before the mystery was solved. i must confess that the biggest hole in the plot kept me awake for hours, wondering how dumb the screenwriter, the director, chrisian slater, molly parker, and stephen rea could be not to at least explain how our murderer, who was not a lawyer, or a policeman, could go into a locked cell at a jail, kill his second victim, and tie him up from a noose to make it look like suicide??? i kept wondering if i had fallen asleep out of sheer boredom and missed how that happened. if someone can explain it to me, please do...and then, why, for god's sake, did he kill the third victim? nothing made sense...and yet, someone thought this film was worthy to be an official selection at a film festival. perhaps it was a comedy and i failed to laugh.

the story is shortly about the faith-lacking business man priest, daniel clemens (christian slater), who is looking closer on a case where another priest is suspected for murder. the priest denies he's guilty but at the same time he is not able to discuss the matter due to confidentiality. enter daniel clemens who starts playing cop...while the plot isn't ridiculous, everything else is. let's start with the visual side, the cinematography is dull, it looks more like a tv-series than a movie. the camera angles are boring, in fact, there's not a single memorable camera angle in the entire movie. there's no interesting closeups revealing details. and the scene transitions, well, there's not much to say about those, they aren't smooth at all, there seems to be no connection between the scenes than the actual plot. okay, they did use a transition with music in between two scenes, but there are no interesting visual transitions in the entire movie, the times dissolve was used there was no visual connection between the scenes.the boring visual part could be forgiven if the film would offer anything else. unfortunately the film only offers forced wooden acting and clumsy dialogue with no punch. on top of that the film suffers from audio problems, the sound volume is lowered several times in the movie as if the microphones would be too far.i didn't predict the solution of the film. it could be because the film never gave me the opportunity or it could be due to the presentation, which was so boring i never even tried to figure it out.put two plus two together and it equals a b-movie where 'b' stands for boring.

isn't it depressing how the most violent cartoon on cartoon network is aimed at girls? while i'm not watching soldiers getting shot and blown up on saving private ryan or band of brothers, it would be nice if there was a cartoon or at least something on tv i could watch to satisfy my violent urges. and something that i would not get made fun of for watching. i did see some episodes (i should really be shot for this) and had to sit through the movie (now, where do i find a gun?), and it is quite clear that this lost its spark after the first few episodes. if you like seeing 500-foot monsters that can destroy huge cities in seconds getting slaughtered by toddlers about one foot tall, this is a must-see. but it does get very boring after a while, and with a show like this, even original ideas become chiefly dull. the movie just felt like one overlong episode (i can't remember any of it), and the villain should have been far more intimidating than a green monkey. this show is a laughing stock. it churns out the same basic premise episode after episode after episode, and though it may try to have some mystery and intrigue once in a while, the ending will always be the same - "the powerpuff girls save the day!" all is good and nice, but all is very, very repetitive... i give it 3 out of 10 for being the only danged cartoon on cn to revolve around violence, although it is aimed at girls, so i won't be tuning in for it ever. i've established myself as a fan of war and violence films and i won't have that reputation destroyed... 3/10

when i first watched this show on cartoon network, i found it uninteresting. then i read a lot of good messages about this show, and i decided to watch it. the show was so boring. each episode was predictable. more, this show has no logic. hypersmart girls, who are going to school and sometimes do such stupid things, 99% of episodes start with a monster attacking townswille, then mayor (he is a real fool, he is not funny, he is so stupid, that i can't imagine how he became a mayor). professor, yes, supposed to be the smartest person in this show, but actually... he even found no difference between monster and his brother. narrator's comments also make this show boring. because they also have similar lines in the beginning of each episode and in the ending. also the animation is very strange. everything except main heroes is shown in an ugly way. also in every epsode this show is giving you some life-lessons, and it means that it is oriented on little children, but if you look closer, you will see, that there is a lot of violence and even blood(!!!) during their battles.

that's the worst film i saw since a long time. historic accuracy is totally non-existent. for example, james wolfe, who his depicted as an anti-french canadian, is shown in london during the summer of 1759. natives are like indians of a bad hollywood movie of the 60's : they wear deerskin clothes and ride horses (the montagnais had never ride horses). the film is taking place in quebec city, but footage is set in louisbourg, showing the atlantic ocean.the original scenario was supposed to include the battle of the plains of abraham, but the producers drop this idea saying that costs for uniforms and participants would be more than 4 millions dollars ! i think they never heard about re-enactment.all the movie is planned to be a new titanic : an impossible love during an historic tragedy (the fall of new-france). there's even a song performed by celine dion at the end of the movie (yes, i stayed till the end of the movie, but i deeply regret). but the worst thing of all is that this movie cost 30 millions dollars. i just don't know how they spend all this money.sorry for my anger, but i'm just too irritated.

i absolutely could not believe the levels of ineptitude on display in this production. i honestly thought gay men had better taste than this. i know i do.the bulk of the blame doesn't lie with the cast, but let's get them out of the way first...the only one with real talent was joe souza (plus he had the best bod in the cast). he had a nice, clear theatre-style voice. okay, and jaymes hodges' voice was so-so, but he had a vacant expression in every number. the rest couldn't hold a note in a bucket, even though the music was obviously dubbed in after the fact. must have been really dreadful hearing them live. they were also all girly-boys except for maybe three. if i wanted to see naked women onstage i could go to the titty bars. not sure why anyone would choose to film the l.a. production instead of new york. i would imagine ny has more readily available singing talent, though one would think in l.a. they would be able to find better-looking guys. apparently not.but i digress...the real blame here lies with the creators and producers. this score was the most banal, insipid tripe i have ever heard. it sounded like some theatre queens took all their musical cd's, threw them in a blender and poured the goo onto a page. sadly, i'm sure there are many who can't tell the difference between good theatre writing and whatever this is. i mean seriously, i was laughing my ass off through the whole thing but not at the lame jokes. i think the morbid 'my-lover-has-died-of-aids-song' entitled "kris, look what you've missed" was the most hysterical thing in the whole show. genius writing...kris / missed...wow...they almost rhyme...must be a good lyric. and jesus...the end of that song..."oh kris, ohhh kris, ohhhh kris..." over and over!!! my other favorite was "you gotta be a pumpy junkie boy to be a humpy hunkie boy"...wtf??? the whole show was full of the most arbitrary lyrics just because they rhymed. where did these people learn to write songs? apparently they listened to sondheim and said "he's not so great, i can do that"...as evidenced by the retarded "bobby, bobby, bobby" reference from company in one song. another irk: why are 20-somethings singing about robert mitchum and tab hunter? obviously coming from the mouths of the lyricists and not the actors...again, bad writing.if you love torture and pain, and i know many of you strange fetishists do, go ahead and watch it. but you've been warned.

i'm writing this as i watch the dvd. i grabbed for the laptop and went to imdb during the first song. i didn't know anything about the movie except that a friend said that the show was supposed to be good. it has a decent netflix rating too, so here i am.maybe on the stage this worked. but i have to say that the sight of chorus boys dancing and singing completely naked just seems silly. and the lip syncing to a prerecorded score adds to the strangeness.most of the songs and routines are about aspects of male nudity. this is my idea of nothing, sorry. the score, so far, is generic show tune music. nothing memorable, or particularly melodic. everything is to serve the lyrics. which, i have to say, sound like they were written by a committee. each song is essentially one extended joke. if the jokes were ten seconds, they might work. these single several-minute-long jokes don't.i'm now watching the movie by chapters--a few minutes until i get the gist. kind of in the hopes that one of them will be different, or entertaining enough to keep me from going on to the next scene. nope.okay. i'm finished. so here's what i think. if you have any experience or long-standing appreciation of musical theater, avoid this--it's just not quality. if, however, you're a gay twenty-something and have never seen or heard a musical comedy, you might be entertained. or maybe this would hold your interest if you've never seen a lot of attractive naked men. i have.

this show has been performed live around the country with a wide variety of casts. i saw it first in the provincetown production the first summer it was in p-town (2001)--before it was, curiously enough, banned in that overwhelmingly gay resort (the codes which resulted in its closing have since been amended). i saw it again later in the off-broadway, long-running production in new york. oddly enough, the p-town production was far better than the new york one--fresher, cuter, more spirited and funnier--but that was only in the 2001 showing; subsequent attempts to clone the production ("bare naked lads" in 2007) were definitely third-rate. this filmed production features a los angelos production cast, and it is, as other comments have suggested, not the best. i would rate it somewhere in between the top-notch 2001 p-town production and the third-rate "bare naked lads" p-town show from last summer.

first off, i'm in the u.s.when i first saw this, i thought it was an obvious - and loathsome - rip off of "the office" (uk). i would have thus awarded it zero stars, but lo and behold, it came out long before the ricky gervais series.still, it's hard to watch this or any other show with a similar dynamic (including the american "office") without comparison. it just isn't even close to being the same thing.i will give it some credit for being original, and ahead of its time. i'll also say that it - and the u.s. "office" and "larry sanders" - are actual satires. the uk "office" is something grander and more transcendent, as if populated with real people in events that felt like they actually happened. however, unlike this or the shrill christopher guest "mockumentaries", it isn't really a satire, while "the newsroom" definitely is.be that as it may, "the newsroom" still isn't very funny. it's aloof, and self-aware, but with a cast and crew not nearly smart or talented enough to heft the goods. it's weighty comedy being carried on weak shoulders. commendable, but ultimately not recommended.--- and what's with the lack of an anamorphic dvd?! i know it was shot in anamorphic widescreen, because i saw the pilot episode on one of our hd channels. cbc, get with the programme. ; )

before seeing this film, the 1998 version was my only experience of this dickens story. i didn't enjoy that film very much, but this 1974 adaptation moves on in a particulary tiresome fashion.the actors don't shine, the main couple michael york and sarah miles are especially wooden cases. the only character of real interest for me was anthony quayle's intelligent jaggers.the so called plot is ridiculous, but the story itself is a great one. it's a real lesson on how your distorted values and obsessive principles can destroy you. live with an open mind and don't care what other people say, you are what you are, if others can't take it, **** 'em. pip was told this early on, but he didn't listen.the girl adopted by the weird old lady reminded me a little of the old kaspar hauser story, not in that same horrible level, but in the way she molded the child to create the executor of her personal vendetta against the entire opposite sex she thought had deceived her. pip's childhood didn't appear much better. the ending didn't seem to fit the rest of the story's style. the sets looked cheap, and coming to imdb i'm not surprised to see that this was indeed a tv-movie (which i had no idea of when i borrowed it from the library).live and learn. so many good movies, so little time. that's why the reviews are here. so you wouldn't have to waste your time on this sort of movies.3/10

no,i'm not a radical feminst bashing the hentai and yaoi genre,i just find it really boring and pointless.my god,i was made to watch this for initiation from some stupid punk and my my,even an mst3k movie has a storyline,not to mention that this hentai crap is what's giving anime a bad name world-wide (watch out sailor moon!).sadly,people don't realize that not all anime(or any other asian style) is sleazy porn.death to the stereotype!!!*starts casting ultima*

oh, i'm mostly not the kind of person to give a movie less than 5 points. mostly, just because of the effort from actors and directors.3/10 for keyman from me. if anyone thinks the main character (or whoever) deserves an oscar, i deserve the nobelprize for peace.seriously. i can't believe this movie made it to europe. the acting was horrible, the plot was awful and what about the '70's horror-music. give me a break."popeye" eg. what about him? why is he there, he has nothing to do with the movie.and what about the keyman's talking. one time he can't say a decent word, the next time he's getting all talky-talk. he also nearly dies when he wakes up and some sunlight shines thru his bunker. but when he's walking down the street, the sunlight doesn't seem to do anything.watch this movie only of you're on the edge of dying of boredom. i regret myself for not watching my roses grow, which are in anyway more entertaining than this piece of...

slow, odd film that drags and plods (i mean really plods) along to its disappointing climax. you may expect some sort of punchline at the end, but there is none. both milland and snodgress give awkward performances; in fact, the film's weirdness may actually be the only thing it has going for it. the generally atmospheric score has some absurd parts (like the music that plays during the first appearance of a monkey), and there is a truly awful fantasy scene involving....a gorilla. (**)

the attic starts off well. the somewhat dreary story is helped greatly by the two main actors and there's a semblance of a character study going on here but the film goes downhill fast when carrie snodgress' character buys a monkey. not one of those cute little monkeys. she buys a real big chimpanzee!!!this sudden plot device basically kills the movie. it's just not conceivable for a woman like the one snodgress plays, who has a hard time doing anything because of her domineering father, for her to, out of the blue, buy a chimpanzee. i mean, come on! forget about it!

linda lovelace was the victim of a sadistic woman hater, chuck traynor. i don't understand how having sex with a dog (which is animal abuse, as well) can be found to be entertaining or funny. linda lovelace was a virtual prisoner who was coerced into making these films. i know some people will criticize this comment but i feel strongly that these types of films fuel the fire of hatred and further misogynistic feelings towards women. this society continues to portray women as sexual objects as opposed to human beings. we call ourselves "civilized" however i feel we have a long way to go before we can ever scratch the surface of being civilized.

what can you say about a grainy, poorly filmed 16mm stag film, where the best and most attractive performer is a german shepherd? nothing that would be positive. avoid this travesty at all costs. in any case, it would be difficult to find, since bestiality remains a taboo and illegal subject in the usa. i strongly suggest imdb to re-visit their weighting formula for establishing ratings, since an 8.8 rating for this piece of fecal matter is absurd! i am, by no means, a prude and have spent many hours enjoying the classic porn movies of the 70's & 80's; but this is inferior product even by the looser standards of the (then illegal) stag loop.

antonio margheriti, director of the enjoyably cheesy cult horror cannibal apocalypse, helms this gothic-flavoured giallo starring gap-toothed 70s icon jane birkin (as well as her massive-conked french lover of the day, serge gainsbourg).unfortunately, despite the inclusion of such treats as a tasty bi-sexual french teacher and a terribly unrealistic killer orangutan, seven deaths in the cat's eye ends up a dreary mess which is a struggle to endure.pretty schoolgirl corringa (birkin) returns to her family's scottish estate after many years away, only to discover that a maniac is murdering her relatives one by one. using the whole array of 'spooky old house' tricks (hidden doorways, dark corridors, creepy graveyards, candlelit cobweb covered rooms), margheriti cobbles together a confusing tale which at times promises supernatural goings-on, but ends up with a lame cop-out ending that is unimaginative in the extreme.'and where exactly does the cat fit in to all of this?', i hear you ask. well, a rather pudgy moggy witnesses each murder thus justifying margheriti's rather cool sounding title.'gory, stylish fun' claims the dvd cover; 'boring pile of dung' says i.

not a terrible film -- my 10 year old boy loved it, and he would be the target demographic, so i guess they hit the spot. pretty dull for an adult though.hard to relate to animated lego characters, even mod high-tech ones.i thought the choice of the three great virtues of the bionicle world was a bit odd -- unity, duty, and destiny. am i the only one who thinks those sound just a bit fascistic? especially destiny. what about freedom, equality, justice, etc.?oh well, it will sell lego. kind of dull for a movie, but not bad for a 74-minute advertisement. could have been a lot worse.

i saw grande ecole at its world premiere on the rotterdam film festival. i had no idea what i was entering and if i'd had any idea i wouldn't have entered. this is the most pretentious film i've seen for a long time. it tries to be provocative, yet deep, with its full frontal homosexual sex scenes - it doesn't succeed! it's nothing but another bad excuse of showing naked persons on the big screen. 4/10

i saw this film at the new festival in new york. it was by far the worst film there. it's use of uncircumcised full frontal nudity and a wishy-washy script and direction that neither commits to a re-make of 'maurice' nor decides it's a neil labute flick, left me feeling 'why would anyone ruin a perfectly good cast like this?'. it lacks irony and fills the vacuum with sentiment, which causes the times when the movie turns on itself to make you want to wipe your face as your mind and heart search for what could be going on in the film but isn't. i wish the director and editor had re-edited the film because maybe there's more story there that could be released from an otherwise unpleasant experience.

this film was nothing more than exploitative gay cheesecake. it was not an "art" movie; just an excuse to show several gratuitous, exploitative, over-the-top scenes with extensive male genital nudity. there was a locker room scene involving over a dozen naked men. the camera zooms in on the men's asses and penises as they are portrayed for several minutes with their dicks in full screen view. there are several scenes in this film showing penis after penis. it gets redundant real fast and makes it impossible to take this film seriously. i was wondering if i was watching a playgirl video by mistake. if these same scenes were filmed using women (ex: totally naked and showing their vaginas repeatedly) it would be quickly dismissed as just softcore porn and an excuse to show a lot of eye candy...which is all that this film is. any artistic merit got flushed down the drain of the gay ghetto mentality. the themes of class distinction, homosexuality, longing-desire, etc. were simple and superficial; no more developed than what one would expect from a first year philosophy student. just cut to the chase and rent a gay porn instead.

"grande ecole" is not an artful exploration of mixed sexuality but, if you're in need of it, a movie for an x-rated channel. although i suspect there's nothing in this movie to spoil for a willing viewer, the plot is simply an excuse for male-to-female and male-to-male couplings set in the unconvincing context of a competition between a parisian school for future ceos and a major school for those seeking higher degrees in the liberal arts. there's likewise a frisson of cultural clash between high status and lower status french youth, plus a societal conflict involving native frenchmen and arab immigrants from north africa. all that's missing is a female-to-female coupling, which could easily have been arranged with no more than a slight twist in the plot.the acting is at a somewhat higher level than in the usual pornographic movie -- but "grande ecole" is, to be blunt about it, no more than pornography with artistic aspirations. i'm not offended by the sex. it's just repetitive and, before long, boring. where's the hays office when you really need it?

this is what happens when you try to adapt a play from the theater. look at the end of the picture, totally theatrical.with a reminiscent of les liaisons dangereuses the final steam-less speech try to make us think that the whole (and deep) theme of this matter was the manhood. who cares by this point? it was about manipulation. and so the audience feels after this movie has ended.young directors: a play is told with the words more than actions. a film is the opposite most of the times.and i'm not talking about the gay theme, overly exploited without a point ('cause there's no explanation of this topic considering the so called "philosophic" or presumptuous basis) to the level that this film should have been called grand gay

i saw this at a drive-in when i was 9. all i remember are a few scenes (the ones where the main character elle is being chased by a guy in a mask) and being scared spitless. seeing it now, my opinions have changed. it's a pathetic "horror" film about an ophanage run by gloria grahame (sad) and dealing with a young, talentless girl elle who is sent there after her mother, the town tramp, was beaten to death with a hammer (graphically shown). the film has adolescents (actually actors in their 20s) being beaten, tortured, killed, starved, attacked with meat cleavers, raped etc etc. the brutal hammer murder is the opening scene and then it gets worse and worse. there is nothing to recommend about this crap. the plot is stupid, all the dialogue is bad and the acting...the less said the better. how did this sickie get by with a gp (now pg) rating? it would get an r now. worthless. one last thing...a truly repulsive twist ending suggests incest!

... a recommendation! gloria grahame runs the kind of orphanage where discipline is imparted with a meat cleaver, orphans are hung on meat hooks to punish them and the bodies are kept in the deep freeze so that they can be brought out for when social services call. that the orphanage is strapped for cash we know because gloria puts all the orphans to work, and also because there don't seem to be enough clothes to go round - especially for the older nubile female orphans (age range appears to be 12 - 30 ish). the new arrival, however, turns out to be more than a match for gloria - and has indeed just taken out her own mother & mother's lover (in a witty claw hammer and arson opening scene). predictably, gloria ends up on a meat hook herself. this one was made for about tuppence but was/is a huge huge huge hit on the grindhouse circuit. my dvd cover promised "disturbing and politically incorrect scenes", and it sure wasn't lying. i believe it is regarded as the citizen kane of orphanage set torture porn movies. 4/10

when the opening shot is u.s. marines seriously disrespecting the u.s. flag, a movie has a tough road ahead, but unfortunately it was downhill from there. there is a military adviser credited, who is also apparently a retired u.s. marine, making it even more baffling that this incredible breach of protocol, and law, went unnoticed. even more baffling is the way they simply glossed over how a marine is reported kia, then buried, in very short order, without the slightest explanation of how they identified the body, or if there even was a body. the u.s. government is still finding the missing from wwii, and it takes months to identify the remains. military shot down remain mia for months or years and are only declared kia when the remains have been positively identified, or after years of red tape. here we are expected to believe that it happens within a matter of days or weeks. maybe this happens in denmark, but not in the u.s. clearly none of the people involved ever had the slightest involvement with, or respect for, the u.s. military.beyond that, there are a number of other utterly laughable moments when characters come up with zingers out of nowhere. there must have been some really extended meetings between auteur and actors as they struggled to find their motivation for such hogwash. having a script that worked might have helped, but this one seems to have been made up on the spot, working from cliffs notes. there's no way to know if the script was this awful originally, or if it was the auteur, or the middle-management kids at the studio who bear responsibility. either way, this is an awful movie that should have never been made.

again, we're getting a melange of themes well covered by so many previous films. the good and the bad son story, courtesy east of eden. the american marine hero story, who doesn't consider himself to be one due to what he knows. and the grieving wife potentially falling in love with another man story.the mere fact of those stories being that ubiquitous isn't so much of a problem though. because theoretically they could still be better presented and dealt with each time around. no luck this time though, as all three of those threads ultimately fall flat all the same.as the bad son never really gets to talk to his father, so that conflict is never resolved properly. apart from the father kind of starting to appreciate the bad son thanks to the latter renovating the kitchen of the grieving wife. now, how satisfying is that.next, the surprisingly homecoming marine suspecting his wife of unfaithfulness conflict never gets resolved. because he never really talks to the man under suspicion, namely his own brother. so once more we're handed a loose end here.and finally, the american military heroism hypocrisy theme, where the marine is publicly considered a hero when, due to the dirtiness of war he went through, he shouldn't really be called one as to his own standards, that third theme falls flat just the same. because the movie ends right when, for the first time, he's just able to talk to his wife about what he went through. where the real story would actually begin at that very point, namely his process of recovery, how that would look like and how he would finally face the family he'd have some major guilt to admit to. all that, all the really interesting bits are passed over and getting ignored.so while story wise this film is a serious, and i mean serious, disappointment, i'd still give it points for the impressive cast. although no film should use maguire for a voice over, because that belongs to spiderman. especially a grown up gyllenhaal seems to fulfill all the expectations he aroused as a young and aspiring actor. so much that i'd in fact love to see him entrusted with a really deep and demanding lead role of proper profile.so while the cast really seems to do what they can, i consider this film totally forgettable otherwise. a shallow and ultimately pretentious, utterly unsatisfying tear squeezer indeed. message du jour to the writers: we know the wounds already, see the host of vietnam films. you want to earn some credit, show us a believable healing.

maybe the best part of the show is the fact that it creeps up right after conan o'brien and late night's fans are all of a sudden unsuspectingly watching carson's show. carson daly can't hold a candle to leno, letterman, o'brien or any other late night talk show host, and last call seems to miss more than hit in this hit and miss genre. the shows only redeeming quality is that it's so short. but, i wouldn't call it crap. carson daly is sincere and doesn't hide the fact that his show isn't great(that honesty is actually helpful here), while some of last call's skits and material seem to be stolen, they still find the mark sometimes. actually, some of carson's montages have been quite entertaining, and the skits occasionally have their moments of decent comedy.as an interviewer, carson is okay, even with only one guest, not exactly late night material but still above the level attained by a high school av team. however, he doesn't have the quick wit that makes conan so hilarious. i do not like his musical guests, but that's more because i am not a fan of that kind of music so, i'm not holding it against him.on to the house band. i don't know joe firstmans band and wouldn't compare them to the cbs orchestra, the tonite show band with kevin eubanks or the max weinberg 7. even cleeto and the cleetones are better. but, firstmans band mates do still the show in my opinion. especially the alto sax player that sometimes shows up (he has long dark hair and sunglasses and is always playing in the upper register), if anything, watch the show for him, i do.in summary, this show isn't even worth a full bag of kibble n' bits. but it does have an audience, and appeals more to the younger "mtv generation". if you don't have cable and are up at 1:37 am, there really isn't much more to choose from and, surprise surprise, there is worse out there in that time frame. so, if you're waiting for poker after dark to come on, 30 minutes of last call wont kill you during the wait.

for a while when i was in-between jobs i had a habit of watching all the late night talk shows. for a while i had a good selection: conan, leno, letterman, ferguson, kimmel...until i reached the 1:30 a.m. time slot. the time between conan and x- files, on scifi. and the only show on at that time was (and curiously still is) carson daly.his show intrigued me at first. youngish, casually dressed, and with the hip pedigree of an mtv host, i thought carson would bring a younger aesthetic to late night. i couldn't have been more wrong.he has no comedic timing. his jokes are plainly unfunny, and his monologue a painful affair of self-conscious babbling. i began to think he simply wasn't capable of delivering comedy (and i am right, he isn't), but it became obvious over time that the writers on the show must have had it in for him. the writing was idiotic and much too overreaching and the skits screamingly bad. and towards the end of the show being in-studio, the writers had carson drinking alcohol on the set with gusto on every show, an oblivious carson grinning from emaciated cheek to emaciated cheek as he sloshed his way through interviews.zero interview skills. none. he tries to be friendly/chatty, but ends up being boorish and rude. he talks too much. he cuts off his guests. he asks them rude or embarrassing questions -- if he can find a question to ask them at all. and as someone had already pointed out, the guests literally stare at him or squirm in their seats, clearly uncomfortable.now the show has left the studio and looks as though it were shot on one handy cam. even still, carson refuses to take the hint from nbc. at one point, carson didn't even get a camera man, he had to film himself for an episode! wake up, carson...that handwriting is all over the wall.i see the show is produced by carson. i can only imagine that is the reason it is still on the air, he pays for it himself.

he seems to be a control freak. i have heard him comment on "losing control of the show" and tell another guest who brought live animals that he had one rule-"no snakes." he needs to hire a comedy writer because his jokes are lame. the only reason i watch him is because he some some great guests and bands. i watched the craig ferguson show for a while but his show is even worse. he likes to bull sh** to burn time.i don't think either man has much of a future in late night talk shows.daily also has the annoying habit of sticking his tongue out to lick his lips. he must do this at least 10 times a show. i do like the joe firstman band. carson daily needs to lighten up before it is too late.

before last call w/ carson daly, my local nbc affiliate aired much more worthwhile programming after late night w/ conan such as second city tv, 3rd rock from the sun & carline in the city reruns, and some stand up comedy. these days there is nothing worthwhile to watch because all i get to see is carson daly and his awful show. he is not a comedian, he is not an actor, he does not deserve to be famous because he isn't a good speaker nor comedian.on his june 21st show, he tried to use an internet meme called the "rickroll" on his show. he failed hard. that event confirms that carson daly is awful.

nothing carson daly has ever said or done on this show has ever made me laugh, or even smile a little. i do not understand how this show has survived for so many years.even the "funny" band member is just like one of those kids in high school who thinks nobody is good enough to even look at him. daly and that dude are just arrogant frat boys. it seems like they don't even try to be a little funny.awful awful awful show.it makes my soul cry.i just cannot stress enough how awful this show is. don't watch it. but if you absolutely have to, i recommend clawing your eyes out and clogging your ears with cement beforehand.

carson daly has to be the only late night talk show host that isn't a comedian. what was nbc thinking! he's not funny! the writing is horrible to! all of the sketches are painful to watch. the current new karaoke isn't funny at all, especially since he tells you what they are going to sing before they sing it! the escalator interviews is just stupid and needless to say not funny at all. all he jokes, especially during the monologue, are the least clever, dumbest, not funny jokes ever put on television! i mean, anytime he makes a jessica simpson joke he ends it with "because she's stupid," which cancels out any funniness that was in the joke, which was already very low. any 3 year old could have come up with any of the jokes and sketches they put on this lame excuse for a show. seriously, don't watch this show, unless you're on the edge of suicide and want something to push you over the edge.

i don't think i've ever gave something a 1/10 rating, but this one easily gets the denomination. i find it hard just to sit through one of his jokes. it's not just that the jokes are so bad, but combine that with the fact that carson daily has zero charisma, can't set up or finish a punchline, and you've got a late night comedy recipe that will really turn your stomach.i have watched the show, never in its entirety, but many times still. it just creeps up on me after conan. i usually watch a minute or two just to see if carson daily is still the worst talk show host ever.actually if you ever do see him interviewing a guest, it's just that, an interview. i feel so sorry every time he has a guest on and their confused smiles try to mask their body language that's screaming, "get me the hell away from this freak!" i do recommend watching the show, not for a laugh, but to ponder, how he got on the air and what he's still doing there. watch as much as you can, i think you will find its complete awkwardness...interesting.

it's not often i feel strongly enough to post something about a film. this was, however, simply the worst movie i have ever seen. the performances were laughable at best, at worst they were, well, there's no other word for it, awful. especially the lead female who's random sexual come-ons have to be seen and heard to be believed. honestly, the plot is nonsensical,the dialogue appalling and the characterisation...there is none. i'm surprised it's not an alan smithee film. i can't stress this strongly enough... avoid at all costs.how do movies like this ever get made? this is no budget film-making at its very, very worst.

jon good's wife (simply one of the worst titles for a film ever), or the red right hand (another absolutely awful sounding title that means nothing & has no relevance to the film) under which i saw it, is set in 'salem, massachusettes 1978' (incidently the year i was born which was quite possibly the best thing to happen during those 365 days) where five old college friends meet up for a school reunion, gay-boy fagot roger mather (john kuntz, is that surname for real? just say it out loud...), martha alden (kim brockington), rebecca lawson (jenna stern) & her boyfriend jake stabler (john doe), alan hobbes (michael kevin walker) & his wife sandy (megan rawa) plus john good (marc ardito, why is the spelling of 'john' different in the title?) & his wife sara (abigail morgan). from the word go there is an uneasy tension in the air & when someone mentions their 'missing' friend calef (jason winther) lots of unpleasant memories come flooding back. then comes the phone calls, the mysterious nose-bleeds, hallucinations & guilt as the true horror of the events all those years ago finally comes to light...produced, executive produced & directed by kurt gioscia who also wrote the thing & kurt st. thomas who gets the art direction credit too & if that wasn't enough they both act in the film as well! personally i thought jon good's wife was awful, i mean she can't cook or anything! ha ha ha, only joking! seriously though i didn't think much of the film overall, for a start it's pretty slow going & the entire first 30 minutes is solid snooze material of the reunion consisting of lots of catching up with each other & dull character building exposition. the film never explains itself, what's with those weird nose-bleeds for god's sake, the mysterious phone calls, the almost inconsequential death of one of the group that might or might not be natural & what the hell was sara all about? she comes across as some nosey, sex crazed, dirty talking, shameless, bitter blackmailing know-it-all whore who apparently sleeps with just about every man she meets! some of the dialogue she spouts wouldn't be out of place in a porno & it just seems totally at odds with the rest of the film which plays out more like a drama than the horror/thriller it was supposedly meant to be. then there's the ending, if there's a worse way to end a film then to just leave literally everything hanging in the air with no closure whatsoever i have yet to see it. the whole thing was very predictable as well, i mean is anyone watching this not going to know that when they all mention their friend calef went 'missing' there wouldn't be more to it?directors gioscia & thomas make an infuriating film, on top of the predictability & annoying climax there is a retrospective narration by alan which i simply don't understand as he has no more or less significance than anyone else & at what point in time is he narrating from? the reasons behind this narration is never made clear or elaborated upon. there's no tension because the whole things so by-the-numbers.technically the film is ok but nothing special & some of the locations & clothes didn't look particularly authentic to me, this never convinced me it was taking place during the late 70's. the acting was alright & what about actor john kuntz last name? i suppose if his wife was standing next to him we could describe them as a couple of kuntz, right?!i really didn't think much of jon good's wife (a blow up doll would have been better! ha ha ha) & i'm not sure who it would appeal to. forget about any gore, horror, violence, scares, atmosphere or excitement, in fact forget about everything that would have made this film watchable because it ain't here. not recommended.

i'd picked this one up time and time again in the rental store, wondering if i should give it a shot. today i broke down and gave it a whirl, and i probably shouldn't have.while the writer/director did give the film a respectable effort, it fell far short of engaging. the characters, while you wanted to feel for them, just didn't have enough development or depth for you to get truly involved with them. sara's sexual outbursts got tiring-- fast. i don't mind sex in films, and i don't mind bitchy characters, but being a "bad" girl doesn't mean you're prone to excitedly ask people at random if they'd like sexual favors. by the time what happened to the characters was revealed, i was bored, and ready to fast-forward to the climax, the end, anything exciting... and nothing delivered. the things the folks in the story eventually inform you of seems forced and unrealistic, and just wasn't played quite right. if they'd have thrown a bit more anguish in there, i might have been interested. this should have been a more of a suspense/drama film, and should have stuck to the title "jon good's wife" rather than the whole "red right hand" and horror film-like cover. hell... this should have had suspense, period.either way... watch this on a rainy day or a late night when there's nothing on the television. though this isn't as great as i'd hoped, i would go for this over some infomercials.

this movie is a clumsy mishmash of various ghost-story and suspense-thriller conventions, none of them fully realized and all of them rather irritating. the script was perfunctory. the acting, ditto. the scary fx were mostly laughable except for one exquisite seat-jumper moment that scared me even though i saw it coming a mile off. now, explain to me someone why you would need ghosts, and black magic, and arcane ritual objects, and count crapula cg boogeymen, and psychic investigators, and family curses, and irish superstitions, and bowls of milk left out for the supernatural beings, and possessed dollies, all in the same movie? with all that you would expect more than one good moment of horror, but this movie is lame, lame, lame.

this was a letdown in many ways. the location filming in ireland, though quite beautiful at times, cannot save this uninspired flick. greg evigan and alexandra paul, as the married couple trying to get their marriage back on track and who inherit a haunted mansion, just aren't interesting characters. paul, towards the end of the film, becomes incredibly annoying and one wishes she would just close her mouth and shut up, as it seems she is screaming as if it has just become an olympic event! other problems with this film are odd segments that have nothing to do with the core of the film, such as the opening sequence with two cleaning women and the woman in a bed with a severed hand climbing over her writhing, naked body. although the woman is quite adequate doing this it does nothing storywise. one is left thinking the production team needed to pad out a short running time and just tossed in some padding and a bit of t and a. the cgi effects are cartoonish as well and the fiery finale rivals co-executive producer roger corman's much earlier and far superior film the fall of the house of usher in all its ineffective cheapness. any attempt at true tension and suspense, and as a result chills, are thrown out the window in this low budget bust. if you like images of ireland you might find something here but you would do better renting or buying a travelogue. skip this unless you are undiscriminating and think plot is secondary. rent another low budget ghost story(if you can find it) titled the woman in black and see how good and scary a movie can be. this was a wasted opportunity.

given that roger corman attached his name to this production, i had high hopes for this film. corman directed many memorable low budget horror flicks in the 1960's. i particularly enjoyed his adaptations of poe's stories such as `the house of usher,' and `the pit and pendulum' and `the raven' which starred the late great vincent price. these films had solid acting, atmosphere, suspense, strong characterization, intriguing plot development and delivered some chilling moments. sadly, `house of the damned,' for the most part, sacrifices these qualities in lieu of cheesy low budget special effects, gratuitous nudity and mindless gore topped with cliche fast edits and camera angles.`house of the damned' starts off interestingly with some beautiful location shots in ireland, but it's straight downhill from here. unfortunately, instead of spending some time building atmosphere, creating characters we might care about, or building suspense - the director opts to begin running up the body count. after a brief introduction to the lead characters, a young couple and their daughter, the audience spends the balance of the film being bounced from one `spooky' event to another which, in this film, substitutes for coherent plot development. the lead characters are so ill conceived and are so badly acted - the audience doesn't care what happens to them. to make matters worse, the `spooky' events are either utterly cliché or unconvincing due to low tech - low budget special effects. the soundtrack has been lifted from `the omen.' the plot, what little there is, borrows heavily from `poltergeist' and `the legend of hell house,' but lacks any of the qualities which made these films convincing.if you interested in seeing well done haunted house flicks, i recommend you check out classics like `the haunting (1963),' `the innocents (1961) or look into corman's early american international films and pass on `house of the damned' unless you're masochistic or mindless.3 ½ out of 10.rob rheubottomwpg, mb. canada

when i first saw this dvd in a bargain bin for three dollars, i really couldn't believe my luck: a christmas movie starring tori spelling, william shatner, and gary coleman??? needless to say, i snatched it up immediately and considered it a worthwhile investment.the movie itself was just as bad as any movie you'd expect to be combining christmas and the three aforementioned "celebrities." the dialogue was inane, the characters were one dimensional, and carol's character arc was completely unbelievable. the movie itself was a lifeless piece of boring that refused to end and made me feel used as a human being when the end did finally come.my advice: don't watch this movie unless you have to and then only under the influence of some serious holiday eggnog.

it has been a tradition since my first vhs recorder for me to collect several of the incarnations of the old chestnut by charles dickens, and i taped this one and "karroll's christmas" this year. fortunately, when this one was run on the hallmark channel at the ungodly hour of 3 am, i was spared having to edit commercials from it. this was, however, it's only saving grace. the writing was excruciatingly dull with almost no clever scenes to save it from being anything more than a teeny-bopper soaper like beverly hills 90210. in this one, a good man who was cast aside for her celebrity seems the only logical explanation for her transformation into a scrooge-like tv talk show hostess. it wasted dinah manoff who just plays bitch goddess to the other bitch goddess tori spelling (who, by the way, had more coats of paint on her face than some colonial houses) and bill shatner is perhaps one of the few fun things in this otherwise dreary adaptation. some of the best opportunities are wasted like the entrances of the ghosts. aunt marla's entrance could have been spectacularly funny in the hands of a decent writer, but this christmas turkey didn't have one, evidently.tori spelling may be a lovely person, but she has all the acting skill of a mannequin, and that makes for a bad show all by itself. yes, it was good to see gary coleman work again, but the script gives him nothing to do really except roll his eyes and spout truly lame dialogue.and what is most infuriating was that the transformation from scroogedom to tori "sweet and light" is as convincing as a passionate conservative. now, if anyone wants to write the ultimate scrooge tale of a george bush and karl rove, we might have a refreshing change from the usual bad christmas carol clones.i suppose if you're a fan of ms. spelling and/or 90210, this might be your cup of christmas cheer. i'd prefer a stiff shot of scotch and a cold beer to wash it down myself. this one i just may cast away before it is with me here for a long long time.god save us everyone!

beethovan lives upstairs is a very bad movie. in my world history class, our teacher had us watch this movie and amadeus to be able to compare the two composers or something. we watched amadeus first and it was a very good movie, but when she had us watch this movie directly after that, i couldn't believe what i was seeing. the acting was horrific, the costumes were ugly (the little boy's was especially ugly and girlish), and the cinematography was z-grade. my friend compared it to a home movie without the date display in the bottom right corner. i understand this was a t.v. movie from canada and probably cost $10 to make, but please, they could have done better. i have seen a few good t.v. movies in my time, but this was not one of them. the biggest thing that i don't understand is why my world history class couldn't just watch immortal beloved or something. how is it possible to compare composers when given the movie amadeus, for mozart, and beethovan lives upstairs, for beethovan? it's not possible to do that when this is the choice of movie for beethovan. i give amadeus an a- (9 out of 10) if anyone cares to know, but beethovan lives upstairs gets an f (1 out of 10).

no wonder a lot of us hate classical music; and what are the children to think? with "educational" pr like this, serious music will soon slip from life support to the morgue. kids know when they're being talked down to, and this is no exception; why can't someone good do a movie about classical music for kids? i must admit, i enjoyed the actor who played beethoven, he took to the role with enthusiasm and a keen balance of the poignant and humorous aspects of beethoven's character; he obviously did his research. otherwise, this is a third rate rehash of the old abc afterschool special format, with none of the occasional charm those short films had. sorry about the rant, but this is an important subject for young people to know about, and it could have been done well; i wonder if musicians or filmmakers were responsible? either way, the kids are hipper than you think, folks...medtner

this movie was so bad and so cheap and so corny, i found this movie to be one of the most boring slow paced early 80's movies that i have ever seen. i like most 80's cheap horror movies but i would never rent this one again. it just did not make any sense. a family that lives in the woods invites their son, his wife and their daughter to spend time with them for the holidays and during the movie for some reason the mother and daughter- in- law do not get along well. we never figure out why until almost till the end of the movie but until then, all we see is the fact that the mother has some form of esp and the daughter- in- law is having nightmares and flashbacks of a catastrophe of what will happen to unfortunate victims to this "thing" that we have no clue as to what "it" looks like, all we see is a bright light signaling his approach and all we hear is a cheap interpretation of darth vadar voices and a soundtrack stolen from various horror movies. then when we finally find out what and who it is all i did was laugh. this "killer" turns out to be some kind of alien japanese warrior from ww2 who has apparently come back to life to claim the mother and her family. and all the mother does is stand there in front of the living room shaking with her hands on fire or something like she's going into some kind of convulsion. this movie is pathetic! avoid it, it's not even worth renting.

unfortunately this is not one of those movies which at least make you laugh at their unbelievable stupidity. it has no entertainment value at all. it just plain sucks. i don't know where to start to explain how much this movie annoyed me. i think what really takes the cake is the unbearable soundtrack. it sounds as if someone took a simple beat and then, for the rest of it, let a 5 year old child run amok with a synthesizer and taped it. it's really that awful and as if that's not enough, there's not one scene in the movie without "music" (=noise). by the end of the movie, you're either deaf or already cut off your ears earlier. which would at least keep you from falling asleep, since there is nothing happening in the movie to keep your attention. just a lot of bad acting, a few cheap and unconvincing kills, no story at all (it just jumps from one scene to another and you as the viewer can try to make any sense of it) and in the last 30 minutes or so you can witness some of the worst "special effects" ever. it's extremely boring. do not watch this movie! you could do something much more entertaining like staring at a wall or reading the phone-book. did i mention how much the soundtrack sucked?

this was a real let down for me. the original bride with white hair is a great kung fu fantasy film but this one was pretty weak. i didn't care at all for the new characters who unfortunately dominated the screen time and the story wasn't well developed. while the first film was tragic and involving this one was tedious (as i merely counted the time to the end when the ill-fated lovers would actually meet). the action was poor in this one as well. the fights were not choreographed very well and there really wasn't much kung-fu at all. just a few weak sword fights between the highly dis-likable lui and one of lin's henchwomen. lin herself mainly uses a sort of telekinesis to throw people into walls and sometimes her hair, a far cry from the impressive showing with the whip and kung-fu she displayed in the previous film. i still gave this movie a 4 because at least it was fast pace and i did want to see what was going to happen at the end, though i (as most anyone who watched the first one) predicted it would go down the way it did and after seeing it i found it anti-climactic and wished they had either made a proper sequel or just left the story alone. i really recommend the first one but as for the sequel only fans of the genre and those who really want to see lin as the bride one more time need apply.

this sequel is quite awful to be honest. i'm a fan of kung-fu movies and this is by far the worst i've seen. bride with white hair 1 was actually quite good and this is a huge disappointment. bwwh 1 was brilliant in some ways with an unique odd-ball evil bad guy.the couple from the first movie played a small role in this movie. instead the movie revolves around a bunch of uninteresting characters trying to seek revenge on their fallen clans. but there's no antagonist in this movie so the revenge is mute.the worst part to this movie is the kung-fu or lack there of. they literally had a street style knife fight. the character at the end refused to fight because there was lack of choreography.

i made the mistake of watching "dark star" (1974) late one night many years ago. it was one of the stupidest movies that i have ever watched:1. bad acting.2. bad writing.3. scientifically stupid plot. (destroying an entire planet because its orbit is unstable or in the way will only make matters worse: instead of having one large, easily avoidable object, you'll have thousands of smaller, but equally lethal and more difficult objects to track.)4. completely unrealistic characters. a painted beach ball as a space alien? the writers must have been doing too many drugs.not surprisingly, the majority of actors that starred in "dark star" never did anything else. of those that did do anything else, the majority never acted again after dark star. therefore, having dark star on one's acting resume was a death star to one's acting career!

this is a student film and it's a piece of crap. i would use much stronger language to describe it but then the review wouldn't be posted and the world needs to know- beyond any possible reasonable doubt- this movie really sucks.there seems to be a different ruler used when measuring an already famous director's early work. like somehow it was genius that we were just too stupid to comprehend since he finally got it right now today. i'm not buying it. the early movie "bad taste" made by the lotr peter jackson's sucks and this "early work" from another famous director really sucks the same way too. these "early works" are representative of crappy everything, from budget to scripts to actors etc.. it all is bottom of the bucket trash. don't be fooled by the big name.if you like watching a handful of male 70's hippie burnouts pretend they could ever command a ship with the worst special effects you have ever seen- this is your movie.i can't f*37449ing believe this thing won a golden scroll award for best special effects. that is a joke right? or a joke award?if you want to watch what this movie wishes it was rent a season or three of red dwarf you smeghead.

i watched a movie called dark talon, dated 1974. the credits to this movie are exactly the same as dark star, so i'm going to presume it was an alternate title. dark talon was nowhere near as funny as everyone else here states. the acting was lame, the editing slipshod, and overall stupid. at the beginning there's an annoying 1970's trucking song called "benson, arizona" that has absolutely nothing to do with the movie. basically the plot revolves around a small crew of an interstellar bomber that goes around bombing places that are unstable. the bombs are sentient and respond to people. the obligatory disaster disrupts communication between the bombs and the crew. one of the crewmen goes out and has an absurdly idiotic existential conversation with the bomb that made no sense whatsoever. the movie i saw was done in under an hour and a half, with commercials thrown in, so i suspect that dark talon is an overedited version of dark star.the alien is an inflatable red beach ball spray painted with a pair of monster hands that it walks on. it was silly and unconvincing as an alien.it's hard to believe that john carpenter had a hand in this. his other movies were so much better.

this is probably the only movie i have ever not been able to make it all the way through. not only was it annoying and boring, but the low production values made it hard to make out the action and in some cases the dialogue. avoid this one like the plague.

i really seldom give either one or ten stars to any movie, but this was so awful, i had to make an exception.i am a scifi fan and have seen a few comedic takes on scifi that i genuinely like. there just wasn't anything here to like.i realize this was started with an extremely small budget by a film student. but even considering that, the sets and effect are bad. the cinematography is mediocre, but may be the best part of the movie.the acting is bad. a sad state when the female voice-over for the computer is the best actor. the dialogue is bad. the script is very weak and the plot is incoherent and almost nonexistent.the humor is not just subtle and sublime; it's nowhere to be found. as an example, a whole 20 minutes, of the 80 minute film, is spent on a lame 2 punch combo joke with the alien mascot and the elevator.this was supposed to be a parody of everything from bad 50's scifi to 2001. what we end up with though, is just a slightly updated version of an old 50's scifi c-movie. at least those movies were funny because they took themselves seriously.

i haven't reviewed on imdb before but this documentary is so overrated that i felt compelled to vent. i wouldn't have even finished watching if i hadn't been a guest at someone's house. the film was poor on many levels: first - treadwell's video footage was contrived. the more i watched, the more he seemed to be acting as a person desperate to be famous instead of one acting out of conviction.second - the others in the film, with the exception of treadwell's parents and the airline pilot, were just as contrived and corny as he was. god, they seemed artificial.third - treadwell's mission to protect the bears doesn't even make sense as he did more harm than good by making the bears grow accustomed to human presence. i believe that treadwell really did love the bears but there is much research which indicates his efforts were misguided. sometimes we have to sacrifice our enjoyment of wildlife to really help.fourth - the film's entertainment value wasn't half that of other wildlife films such as "march of the penguins" and "winged migration". the filmmakers, in my opinion, did a poor job of sequencing scenes and gave little incentive to keep watching.as a person who loves alaska, bears, and other wildlife, i would love to see more people dedicated to the preservation of our wildlands. hopefully their efforts will be less people-centered.

i found this film extremely disturbing. treadwell is delusional and disturbed, to the point of probably suffering from a mental illness. the footage shown is him and not an actor, but yet it is showing behaviour that ended in death. is it appropriate to show actual footage of a suicide? let's not mince words. the film shows footage of behaviour that directly led to his death.for those who think that treadwell is some kind of hero, think again. the footage he shot is about him and not about the bears and foxes he claimed to be helping. he did no meaningful research into their habits or numbers and did nothing to actually protect them. all he did was run around in the bush and convince himself that he was better than everyone else. reality is, by helping to desensitize the animals to humans, he exposed them to great risk. his self indulgent behaviour not caused his own death, but also the death of his companion amy plus exposed his beloved bears and foxes to greater harm.but i'm also concerned about werner herzog's actions in compiling this film the way he did.a friend and i have had a long argument about this film who loved this film. he believes that seriously disturbed people make for interesting subjects and he cites the movie downfall as an example. but in downfall they use actors. we didn't see the real madga goebells put cyanide capsules into her own children's mouths.there was something about using the real footage in grizzly man which reminded me of that horrible football stadium tragedy where people were being crushed to death and the photographers who could have helped, elected to simply keep recording the horror.herzog's film shows us that treadwell's footage is more about treadwell. but herzog has done the same. his own personality and opinions are aired in this documentary, which is supposedly about someone else. scenes such as the one where he listens to the tape are not necessary. we already knew what was on the tape because the coroner had told us. we didn't need herzog shedding a tear with one of treadwell's former girlfriends. it didn't add to the film.the film showed us that treadwell was very self-indulgent, but it also showed us that herzog is as well.

i used to love the muppets. the muppet movie, the great muppet caper and the muppets take manhattan were good family movies, cleverly written and fun to watch. i never thought i would see the day when they would jump on the hollywood sleaze bandwagon, but here it is: scooter as a caged rave dancer, pepe making lewd and suggestive comments every five minutes -- this is not your father's muppets. it's not jim henson's muppets anymore, either.this "it's a wonderful life" themed movie has its moments, but not enough to save it. i cringed while watching this with my children. i still have hope for their next movie, but this one was certainly a disappointment.

i am still waiting for that dark muppet film where we won't know how it ends from the beginning. i think linklater could do one hes experimented with animation. this time i was intelligently not expecting such a thing but deeply wishing.joan cusack sucked. she moved to a made-for-tv level lazily acting this one with cliched cynic. the muppets were more life-life than she was. a disappointment.but then the entire film was, bar pepe. i loved him. he was the only one to ever get me laugh(while goldbergh as god got me choking and cursing). if we can't see a dark muppets than how about at least a pg:13 one with more of pepe's controversial jokes and animals metal-head, egg-nog-chuggin persona.the worst muppets i saw even the boring christmas carol beats this one out. the muppets need to avoid this over commercialized holiday.5/10

i am and have been a serious collector of christmas related movies, tv shows, holidays specials, etc., for over twenty-five years. please heed my warning and do not be mislead by sterling reviews & media hype about this movie. this is not a muppett movie as we have come to know them, and is certainly not for children. the fact that this was produced for a major tv network is/was no surprise considering their level of operation at this time. what is hard for me to believe, is that the jim henson organization stooped so low to become involved in this travesty of christmas.i wish there had been reviews for me to read that would warned me before i wasted my hard earned money on this piece of trash.

it's too slow paced and complex for children, and too lightweight and dull for adults. none of our family (6 weeks to 66 years) could be bothered watching it all the way through.are there jokes in it? i couldn't really tell. there was certainly some unnecessarily adult innuendo. there was probably a bludgeoning message of sorts, but i wasn't engaged enough to care.the live talent are just stumbling and mugging their way through it. i have to wonder if they were actually being paid, or whether it was some form of community service or plea bargain."please, keep watching," whines daniel; honestly, i wouldn't bother.

i've been a fan of jim henson and his characters since the very beginning. the most beguiling thing about them was the love and innocence and camaraderie shown. kermit was a role model of deep thinking and problem solving. a spiritual character, yet sweetly and believably so. all the other characters were slightly eccentric but it demonstrated how different kinds of beings can co-exist in a caring manner together, respecting each other's difference.following movies have somewhat kept the same vibe. yet this "it's a very merry muppet christmas movie" would have jim henson spinning in his grave. these characters have been completely re-written to be horny, nasty, selfish, and cheesy.the cast goes on to portray god as an uncaring corporate head, with a mean streak. angels as spineless, non-spiritual corporate staff, and the movie was so bad i had to stop watching. i had bought it for my great-nephew but fortunately i preview anything i give a child.this movie deserved the trash bin instead and has no socially redeeming content or charm.shame, shame on the people who re-wrote the characters and departed from jim henson's original heart-centered, socially conscious version. it does a terrible disservice to a great hearted man who is no longer around to defend his creations.

i once saw a bit of this film, and was interested to see the full thing just to see why the critics give it two stars, the result being that i agree. basically the film begins with kermit the frog (steve whitmire) telling all his muppet chums that they have lost everything, and he ends sitting depressed (and possibly thinking about suicide) on the bench. meanwhile, in another world (heaven) angel daniel (david arquette, who had already been in muppets from space) visits the 'boss' (whoopi goldberg, another reason i wanted to see the film) to show that kermit really needs help. in the flashbacks, it shows kermit, miss piggy (eric jacobson, not the original and better frank oz), gonzo (dave goelz), fozzie bear (also jacobson), pepe the prawn (bill barretta) and all the other muppets have prepared a stage show for many people to see in the christmas holiday, and it all seems to be going well. but the really mean rachel bitterman (joan cusack) is determined to either shut the show or the theatre down, and kermit is doing everything possible to make sure that doesn't happen. of course, kermit fails the last time, and bitterman tells him that they are finished, and she can officially take the theatre. this is where daniel is sent as kermit's guardian angel to try and help him, but kermit is not in the mood, and eventually ends up saying "i wish i was never born". obviously, you can recognise the spoof of it's a wonderful life, with kermit as the george bailey, and cusack as the mr. potter, and in the end, obviously kermit realises how much he means to everyone, and goes back to find the theatre saved as historical landmark. also starring whitmire as rizzo the rat and beaker; goelz as dr. bunsen honeydew and waldorf; barretta as dr. teeth, rowlf the dog and swedish chef; jacobson as animal and yoda (the only character who sounds similar to oz's version), william h. macy as glenn, matthew lillard as luc fromage, carson daly, molly shannon; scrubs' zach braff, sarah chalke, neil flynn, john c. mcginley and judy reyes, mel brooks as joe snow; brian henson as scooter and janice; jerry nelson as robin the frog, statler, pops and floyd pepper, and kevin clash as sam the eagle. the most memorable moment for me is the stage spoof of moulin rouge, besides that and the well known faces in it, not fantastic. it was nominated the emmy for outstanding music and lyrics for the song "everyone matters". the muppets were number 47 on the 100 greatest pop culture icons. adequate!

i saw this movie for the first time on nbc friday 11-29-02. it was a pretty good movie, but i don't think it would be the kind of muppet movie jim henson would make. i mean first of all, pepe' using the word "sexy" every now and then, and pepe saying "it would suck?" and i defenitly know jim henson wouldn't allow kermit yelling "i wish i'd never been born!" thirteen time a minute. this movie just isn't like a classic muppet movie. sure i can understand nicky holiday stealing the baseball diamond from "the great muppet caper," but a business lady cheating the muppets in a contract for their theater to turn it into a smoker's nightclub. if jim henson was here today, he would hate this movie!

do you know what farmers spray on fields ? that's right - manure , so when the bbc decided to make a much hyped conspiracy thriller about gmos and farming what we got was some of the smelliest manure the bbc has inflicted upon its audience !!!! spoilers !!!!fields of gold opens with a bunch of masked scientists in a lab where a female scientist ( according to the right on trendy bbc all scientists are women ) announces " a new strain of wheat that will save the third world from hunger " then the story switches to another equally bland scene . if you're going to make a thriller of any type shouldn't you open with a hook that grabs the audience ? doctor who was brilliant at this as was the x- files while 28 days later opened with a hook that took place in a laboratory. i guess someone at the bbc didn't think this thriller needed a hook because the viewers had trailers stuffed down their throat for weeks in advance as the ( not very exciting ) story continues a couple of journalists ( one's a drunken man with morals lower than bill clinton and dubya bush combined while the other is a female journalist full of virtue ) investigating patients at a county hospital who might be getting bumped off via " mercy killings " . it's at this point things start getting confused as the female journalist is threatened by mi5 spooks and the first episode ends with the main mi5 spook getting murdered the second episode reveals that the patients at the county hospital have actually been dying due to being infected with a vrsa superbug . this is when things go totally hay wire . all throughout fields of gold the audience have been led to believe the intelligence services and the company shown in the opening sequence have been behind the deaths - but they're not . it turns out the bad guy is an organic farmer who has been manufacturing the vrsa superbug in his bedroom and the story ends via the matrix camera work with the drunken male journalist setting fire to a field ridden with vrsa thereby spreading the superbug throughout the land i find it impossible to say a good word about fields of gold . at the time of its broadcast i was both a member of the scottish green party and greenpeace . i have since renounced my time in the environmental movement but even now i am somewhat offended by how environmentalists are portrayed here and to have the bad guy spreading a fatal genetically engineered virus as a warning to the dangers of genetically modified organisms is very silly. it's a bit like a cnd member letting off a nuke in london to warn of the dangers of nuclear war . i was also slightly offended as to how the male characters were written as being bastards while all the females were highly intelligent and morally superior to men . there's also other problems with the script especially with regard to vrsa . if unlike the scriptwriters you take the time and trouble to research vrsa you'll find it's entirely different from what is seen here . oh and if you set fire to diesel it doesn't explode like napalm . perhaps the worst criticism of the script is that it resembles jeepers creepers structure wise whereby the last ten minutes contradicts most of what has gone before . where as jeepers creepers only lasted about 90 minutes fields of gold lasted twice that length so is doubly irritating and illogicalas a footnote environmentalism never makes a good theme for a thriller ( anyone remember those steven segal movies ? ) and it's about time tv and film producers realized this

what was wes thinking making this dribble? it does not jive well with any of his other work but then again he seemed to fall into a slight slump after making a a nightmare on elm street. this can be seen by his follow ups 1.invatation to hell 2.chiller 3.hills have eyes ii 4.deadly friend 5.serpant and the rainbow 6.shocker all of these films were either mediocre our crap it was not until people under the stairs that he gained his momentum back and started to kick butt again. chiller it'self has none of craven's regulars and none of his suspense. the only good scene in when the old man has a heart attack on the stairs after graveling for his job.

interesting topic. pathetic delivery - script and direction. our hero, miles, thaws out and has his emergency world-first life restoration surgery. this is where the fun begins. the underlying issue is that miles has no soul!!! this is used to explain his quasi-erratic behaviour of being indirectly responsible for two deaths (i believe this to be the total number of deaths in 104 minutes). on the livlier side, miles prefers the odd glass of brandy, blazing fireplaces and his young, maturing female cousin. the finale does indeed do justice to this film.some thoughts: 1. producer $$$ were parted with to create this tripe. j.d. feigelson was the script writer and a (or sole) producer. looks like he did not learn a lesson on "how not to bring an interesting idea to life" when one views his other writing credits. this will support the credibility of this script.2. now available on dvd!!! this is truly scary. should be forever "bottom of the shelf" in vhs format.3. a re-incarnated human without a soul will default to an evil entity. 4. the score offers minimal support. not even an in-form jerry goldsmith could save it.5. deserved the 0230 time slot on tv and a touch more entertaining than the infomercials + test patterns it was competing against at the time of my viewing.6. thankfully did not spawn any sequels ala wes craven's "nightmare" franchise. chiller too: the return return of miles, or something like that.despite my rating of 1, i still recommend this movie as a great example of how to kill an acting or script-writing career. this should apply to directing, however wes craven will eternally be exempt due to his sole good piece of "a nightmare on elm street" 1984.

i purchased a dvd of this film for a dollar at the big dept store. that's probably the best and kindest comment i have to offer on it. at least it didn't cheat me out of the cost of lunch.the problem with "chiller" is craven's problem as a director. the man has his apologists who claim his traveling papers prove he's a really smart guy and all-around sharp conceptualist. but it's no secret that, as a director, he has never possessed one iota of the visual and story-telling sense of a hitchcock. as vigorously attested by "chiller", he's much closer to that legendary flat-foot hershel gordon lewis. what craven lacks as a director is the main ingredient that would lift him from director for hire to a higher plane of film- making.let's be specific. the transitional moments of this film are sleek. the establishing shots give it the feel of a quality production. the film looks professionally put together, in the way a film shot by a tv commercial director would. (a thought: the films only visual distinction, these transitions that at least look professionally handled may very well be the work of some second unit directors.) it's the parts between the bridges and smooth transitions -- the drama -- that fall flat. the core of the proceedings are invariably perfunctorily handled. the critical shots (after, say, the departing car drives into the well-positioned camera, then we cut to the night exterior of a hospital, then to the waiting area and hallway, then to the phone booth in the corner that will figure in the next bit of action) are quickly dispensed so we can hurry up and get to the next part. craven never comes anywhere close to exploding the dramatic or visual possibilities of any moment. the net result of all this misplaced attention to the least important parts, and the fumbling rush to keep things moving, is a film that feels like the work of the fledgling art student who sharpens all his pencils, fussily adjusts his easel and lighting set-up, grinds all his pigments, stretches and primes his canvas ...and then has nothing to say. craven, like the art student, never gets to the meat of the exercise.for craven apologists who will point out that this film was made for tv, i will point to spielberg's "duel" and say no more.

sorry i couldn't be more expressive in my summary, but those two words seemed to describe the movie perfectly. this is not only a bad film, but a bad film with bad acting and a plot that will be inconsequential to most watchers.see it only for a naked rebecca de mornay tied to a chain-link fence and moaning with 'ecstasy; supposedly 'erotic', but actually hilarious.

rebecca de mornay can be a fascinating beautiful actress but as for the parts she's given to play,if you cannot say something nice...de mornay portrays a woman who had terrible traumas as a child with a father she can hardly stand now that she's a grown up and has become a -of course brilliant- shrink.she has an affair with banderas ,whom we suspect of being (ouch!how original!) a serial killer.sometimes she recalls banderas's mother-in-law tippi hedren's character in "marnie" .but i wouldn't count on it:hitchcock died twenty-four years ago ,and a lot of regents desperately try to replace him .here the director pulls out all the stops to make a thriller with an unexpected end,but that ending is so far-fetched it is absolutely impossible to buy it.the movie includes the obligatory "conversations with a serial killer" in the "silence of the lamb" tradition,murders (human beings and cats),split personality,and open ending in case the crowds should call for more.apparently they did not,and they were right.

man, is this lousy. it doesn't deserve much in the way of comment so, keeping it brief, rebecca demornay is a highly disciplined police psychiatrist who falls for latin lover antonio banderas in a wine store, he of the ponytail and jail-house tats. when she cuts loose, she really cuts loose. other than this torrid affair she's having (and we must admit the affair has its speed bumps) she's a pretty cold fish. her broke, ailing father shows up for the first time in years and she boots him out. she's also adept at keeping her horny upstairs neighbor (dennis miller) at bay. and there's prisoner harry dean stanton who's trying to maneuver her into giving him a diagnosis of multiple personality disorder so he won't have his privates nailed to the wall for the serial murders he's committed.all these people, and perhaps more, are immediately suspect when strange things begin happening to her. somebody sends her dead flowers. somebody does unspeakable things to her pet cat. (the next time i see a household pet turn up in a parcel or strung up in the closet or boiled in a pot, i'm going to puke.) so who's doing it? guess. no power on earth could force me to reveal the ending, but maybe a hint will help: childhood abuse.the abuse excuse is an interesting business in itself, far more interesting than the movie. what does "childhood abuse" mean? do we mean sexual abuse? physical? both? how about whacking a kid over the back with a wooden cooking spoon, hard enough to break it? that's what happened to me and my brother when we were kids, just as similar things happened to all the other errant boys in the neighborhood. sexual abuse? that never happened to any of us, as far as i know, although i'm not sure it would have been rejected with any degree of animation. in the samoan village i studied for two years, there was one case of an adolescent boy found playing sexually with a much younger girl. the girl's family beat hell out of him. the boy's own family sent him to live with another branch of the family in another village, an exile that lasted two years. by the time he returned the incident was forgotten by everyone, including the child. (by the way, the little girl we see here is under five so it's unlikely that she'd remember dad's night-time visits in any case since long-term memory isn't really established until about that time.) demornay's experience leading to her mental disorder can be called "the social construction of trauma." it's not there unless we put it there. enough of the psychiatric lecture. that will be fifteen cents.you want trauma? i'll give you trauma. the film absolutely forces us to identify with rebecca demornay's character, right from the beginning. then, when she has her first tryst with antonio banderas, and pio donnagio's score is pounding the eroticism into our heads, the camera gives us a shot from over her shoulder of the bare-torsoed antonio crawling over us with his hairy chest. now that's traumatic. it makes any male viewer feel as if he's on the floor of the laundry room at the california men's colony in san luis obispo. don't get me wrong. i don't dislike antonio banderas. it's just that i'm not in love with him. there aren't enough nude shots of rebecca demornay's elfin body in the entire universe to compensate for that kind of anxiety.here's an engaging way of surviving this movie. instead of just sitting there puling, try picking out the scenes that were filmed in toronto and separating them from the ones shot in budapest. it's a challenge, really, and may, for all we know, preserve your sanity.

this is one of the worst movie i have ever seen. it's a thriller with a rather ridiculous ending. i watched this movie hoping for the best and instead found something truly bad. the movie starred two actors that i like very much, rebecca demornay and antonio banderas. sure they had decent chemistry together but for what? the movie's premise was bad to begin with and the execution just made it even worst.miss demornay plays sarah taylor, a psychologist trying to analyze a convicted serial killer whose defense hinge on multiple personality disorder. that pretty much will give you a hint to where the movie is going and the identity of the killer. early in the movie she gets an unexpected visit from her father. this being made in the 1990's when the bad daddy was the in thing in hollywood is another clue to the ultimate conclusion.mr. banderas plays a mystery man named tony ramirez, who comes into sarah's life. the whole first meeting and first encounter between tony and sarah is so badly done and so unconvincing it makes you wonder how it even got shot. and there's a sequence where the two of them are supposed to be knowing each other that is so sappy it doesn't seem to belong here. one thing that i would admit was that there was a sex scene that's very hot. anyway creepy things start to happen after he arrives, weird packages arriving, things falling off the wall that could kill sarah, incident that say things aren't normal anymore. overall the movie was badly conceived, the editing at times seem jumpy, and the conclusion was laughable. another thing that bugged me about this movie was the whole orchestral music playing in the background. a more subtle musical score would have been better. i have to say this, no matter how bad the ending was, miss demornay was very good in that sequence. it's sad that she never got first rate materials in her career. she's that rare combination of talent and beauty.

to judge a movie just for the landscapes,decor,costumes....it is just not right , you are missing the core : the storya movie has to narrate something , to tell a story something that impress you . yes , i was pleased by the sea , cliffs , clear water and all that but ... there is the plot ?they are more interesting movies with mad people , such as : flight over the cuckoo"s nest...etc...etc. this one is about a crazy woman who is more attached to dogs than his children or his husband. just a clear psychiatric case !!!! nothing extraordinary.unfortunately a waste of time . and there is all that rage coming from ? fish smell ? sea ?

this could have been a breakout role for valeria golino but the film instead decided to shift its attention to another area. the film is about a woman named grazia (golino) who is married to a fisherman and the mother of three. she is a free spirit and prone to outbursts so the rest of the village and her family decide she should be sent to milan and see a doctor. the story takes place on the island of lampedusa off of sicily and it shows the everyday life there with the teenage boys in rivaling gangs and just trying to find something to do on the sun baked rock. grazia's oldest son pasquale (francesco casisa) adores her and is always trying to protect her during her bouts of depression. the daughter marinella (veronica d'agostino) is a blossoming young girl who becomes infatuated with a local policeman and the youngest son filippo (filippo pucillo) is very sassy and mocks the policeman's accent. upon learning that she is to be sent to milan, grazia runs away and pasquale helps her by hiding her in a cave while everyone searches for her. this film could have really made more of an impact if it could have concentrated its focus to grazia. we do see some outbursts and irrational behavior on her part but their is no follow up to these scenes. nothing comes of it. the film looks great and is beautifully photographed so give director emanuele crialese credit for that but the story needed to focus on something more substantial. the film does a good job of showing us what life is like on this island and what is going on in the lives of the three children as they grow up. their is some speculation that golino's character gives a hint of being a mermaid like creature and that is why she is having difficulty existing on land. i also sense that the island itself expects its inhabitants to behave in a certain manner and if you don't then you can be subjected to the harsh realities of its rules. all speculations but i do think the films attention could have stayed with the character of grazia. after she hides in the cave she really has nothing to do. in a sense, the character becomes stagnant. i wish golino had more to do because i've always liked her and whenever she is onscreen you just can't take your eyes off her. she's a bundle of fury, passion and raw energy! what a shame crialese didn't write a more complete role for her to act in. when the film ends your left feeling empty from an incomplete story.

i'm sorry folks, but these enthusiastic reviews on this prestigious site about this movie "respiro" are very strange, to say the least. is craziness picturesque, i ask and didn't find an answer. of course, the movie is beautifully filmed, at part it's almost a documentary. but then, the fact is that when it comes to the women grazia, she shows every sign of a deep illness and i was wondering throughout the movie what the heck she has. her behavior is absolutely worrisome and the (shocked) citizens of the village are very right indeed in wanting to send her off to a proper institution to see what can be done about her condition. she needs treatment, urgently! behaviour like hers is inferno to everybody around her, her husband, the poor children (especially) and the fellow citizens. let's not be falsely romantic about this! i hated this condoning portrait of a mentally ill. why, for god's sake, should the husband not want to have her cured or at least try to do this? why the horror of going to milan (a big city, sure, but lots of possibilities of capable persons to cure her)? narrowmindedness? irresponsibility? anyway, i inspired myself on this site for renting the movie on dvd and after seeing it i had to post this for others to make themselves an opinion on it. frankly, i understand why the movie did not get any further as an indication to the cannes selection...

a lack of character development proves fatal for this movie. valeria golino's character grazia starts out looking like a bipolar personality but quickly degenerates into a caricature and seems unreal. the other characters are thin, probably the writer's fault not the actors'. the only exception is filippo pucillo as the younger son filippo: his energy and bravado are funny and convincing.i suppose the children's petty cruelty is supposed to contribute to an atmosphere of bleakness and emphasize the pervasive primal spirits in the town, but for me, the gratuitous cruelty is redundant and contributes to the overall boredom of the film. some scenes were amusing but not necessarily intended that way, for example, when the mistreated dogs turn out to be fat and healthy and look like they are ready to show. the pretty cast and setting make for an appealing trailer but cannot carry the whole movie.

the synopsis of this movie led me to believe that it would be a story of an unconventional woman challenging the conventions of the society in with she lives. i like strong female characters and expected a movie much along the lines of "chocolat" with a less fairy tale and more bite. what i got was a cast of despicable characters.for a character-driven movie to be effective, i need to feel a connection or compassion for the people. there was no one with whom i could relate in the movie. grazia (golino, whose work i admired in "rain man") portrays a mentally ill, probably bipolar, female that is often rude, aggressive and violent. her husband bickers and yells, when he is not hitting or slapping someone. the children are rude brats. they yell at each other and the females in the movie. they attack other children with no provocation. violence begets violence. this seems to be an island of unfeeling, aggressive, violent and rude people all the way around.the direction is not compelling. there are intermixed scenes that attempt to be art, but instead bore the viewer. the location is exceptionally gorgeous, but even that fails to be captured to the degree that it could be on film.i would have to recommend that you stay away from this failure of a movie.

... i am left with little choice but to employ it at least once during the course of my review of respiro. among other things, what defines pretension is in my opinion a lack of emotional sincerity on the author's part. respiro seems made with an all too contrived and self-aware intent to be artistic, symbolic, spiritual, provocative, metaphorical... mythical, even. but luckily for all true artists out there, a predisposed formula to achieve artistic beauty and depth doesn't exist. stunning natural locations (yes, these remote parts of southern italy look exotic even to most other italians), pretty actors and some amusing, gutsy, spontaneous performances by a handful of attractive children won't elevate a substanceless movie beyond a pretty succession of images. yet this insincere and vain, and ultimately hollow movie aches to be art, succeeding only to a very limited extent, perhaps in some cases by accident. i'll admit that the conceptually pompous ending does have a certain visual poetry to it. however, it's my belief that this was achieved in ways that had more to do with the beauty of the lampedusa sea and the strong symbolic power of bathing and water (connecting it to so much that's mythical, mystical, religious, archetypical, etc) than with crialese's talent.valeria golino is gratingly histrionic and affected in her performance as grazia. for a mentally unstable woman from a humble and provincial background, she sure has a fashionable wardrobe. her flattering, floaty floral dresses and attractive, sun-kissed beach hair could have graced the pages of any vogue summer edition. the fact she was a "nutcase" could in a way have been nothing but a fashionable addition to her trendy demeanour and look - that's how skin-deep her "condition" seemed to me. golino's two-dimensional stereotype of the innocent, natural child-woman misunderstood and oppressed by her backward community was tiresome and irritating at worse, while leaving me unmoved and indifferent at best. i agree with the reviewer from london who wrote that mental illness is very badly served by cinema - during the course of the entire movie we never really get a sense of grazia's illness and have no idea what is actually wrong with her (other than her being a tiresome stereotype of a "free spirit"). we don't know why she's given injections and is required to see a specialist in milan. this generic way of writing mental illness is one of the main tell-tale signs of the movie's overall shallowness.another fairly insulting aspect of respiro is the quaintification of its location. i struggled to figure out whether this movie was supposed to be set in the present day or the past, seeing as it aimed to make even an admittedly backward part of italy (by comparison) seem a dozen times quainter and more conveniently primitive than it actually is. again, this smacks of shallowness and a complete lack of sincerity on crialese's part. some non-italian viewers will gleefully lap up the picturesque backwardness, the cliché of the possessive, macho italian man as if it were common-place, so keen will they be to continue viewing my country as one culturally stranded sometime in the 1950s (the question i'd like to ask david ferguson, the reviewer from dallas, texas is as follows: is your country's mentality stuck in the 1950s? no? ok, then why should mine be?). unfortunately for whoever still wishes to view italy in such an anachronistic way, that aspect of respiro is actually ridiculous and phoney even in the eyes of this italian viewer. the subtly incestuous tension between grazia and her eldest son was as tiresome and predictable as fabrizio bentivoglio's sexist-but-loving-husband routine. i especially loathed the scene in which grazia joins her husband and male friend in some man-to-man banter over a bottle of beer, to her husband's macho embarrassment and displeasure. according to this movie, it isn't a woman's place to take part in a man's conversations. ah, but our "loveable" "free-spirit" is too good for this place and doesn't understand the oppressive, unwritten rules of lampedusan patriarchy! not only does this scene depict something so fake, it should be enough on its own to discredit the entire movie's credibility. it also completely gets the wrong end of the stick of the culture it strives to depict, clearly showing that it was written without a clear understanding of the location or its population. i would challenge anyone who knows contemporary italy to say otherwise.for a truly accomplished contemporary italian filmmaker, one who in my opinion deserves to be listed among the greats of italy's glorious cinematic past (which alas, isn't the shadow of its former self!), look no further than gianni amelio - especially lamerica, così ridevano and his latest, la stella che non c'è. unlike most contemporary italian cinema, sadly derivative and stagnant, amelio's is a fresh and independently creative voice. despite my scathing review of respiro, i am now more than willing to believe that crialese's latest nuovomondo, now showing in italian cinemas, will be a worthwhile one. i therefore look forwards to enjoying it, though it won't be overly shocking to me if i don't (considering my feelings for respiro!).

i'm surprised over the number of folks that have rated this entry as their favorite "chan" (didn't they ever see "...at the opera" or "...at treasure island?"--- the latter ironically written by john larkin, who dropped the ball here). this plot is a train wreck and overloaded with pointless characters. first, viewers are required to recall the sordid details of steve mcbirney's (played by venerable thug and huac squealer marc lawrence) 1929's murder spree. let's not forget he escaped a capital murder rap at the courthouse with a lone policeman on his tail. there's also a victim that was fished out of a river 11 years earlier that no one ever seems concerned about. then there's the suspension of disbelief required when all the characters are seemingly trapped in the wax museum (although inspector o'matthews manages to wield his fat wet rear end inside through a window). why is joan valerie (as cream's assistant) in this movie? she can't even handle pliers properly--- i realize chan suffers the same boo-boo but yeesh, he's 66 years old here-- (and has less than 10 lines--- and her character's motivation is too weak to ever be adequately 'splained (excuse me, when i'm on a rant i write like ricky ricardo). the mary bolton (marguerite chapman) character is written to as a eager wide-eyed moron, apparently existing only for the vapid romantic interest of horndog lawyer tom agnew (played by the ferret-faced ted osborne). why is willie fern a character? why couldn't mcbirney's henchman pulled the switch at 8:20? (not a spoiler, okay?!). one wonders how, with the iq of lint he manages to dress himself or why he hadn't stepped in front of a bus years ago. toler himself is given a little more acting rope than usual (a plus) and the real kudos go to set designer thomas little and cinematographer virgil miller who created some genuinely spooky atmosphere... but this entry has less logic than a ritz brothers film. i'm still boggled by how a toothpick can be used as a blow gun.

sayles had a very interesting film on his hands with silver city, however it somehow became very muddied as it progressed from beginning to end. chris cooper did an exceptional job embodying the essence of his character, a dubya of sorts, but he wasn't nearly given enough screen time. instead, we find ourselves on a rampage with a character that felt less personal, less developed, and overall too confusing. the path that this danny huston leads us on inevitably becomes the downfall of the film. too many characters are introduced to us in such a short time. these characters randomly were involved with the progression of the plot, which became too convoluted with each passing minute. sayles knew what he was creating, i just feel as if it wasn't being translated well to the silver screen.sayles is a master of his trade. his films continue to inspire and evoke thought even if they are not commercial successes. the trouble with silver city is that i think he found himself going too deep with not enough money or time to explain it all. at the beginning of the film, i had an idea of what was happening, but as more and more characters were introduced, as more and more plot twists tried to occur i lost the sense of the film by the ending. while the ending was very clever and very dark, i needed more explanation. i think some of the reason that i lost my train of thought with this film was due to the casting of danny huston as our guide. he was pathetic. i didn't seem him as very exciting person to lead us on this adventure. he seemed to go through the motions, but not really accomplish much at all. this was the first downfall of sayles' important film.while i will admit that the characters played by richard dreyfuss, miguel ferrer, james gammon, and daryl hannah were interesting, i just needed a better guide to help me understand their roles in this political scandal. danny huston just did not cut it for me. outside of the characters, sayles needed a stronger script. i sometimes felt that unless i was deeply rooted in the political world, some of the references were well over my head. the entire reasoning for silver city to be built and the corruption behind it eluded me. i am a simpleton that loves advanced films, but this one just didn't make much sense to me. there were several times that i found myself asking, "why" instead of seeing the whole picture. i felt as if the individual stories were as clear as glass, yet the whole picture was dusty and murky at the same time. sayles needed to concentrate more on the bigger picture instead of these smaller issues, which ultimately fogged this film.perhaps i went into this film with the wrong idea. i was expecting to see another version of primary colors, but instead witnessed something less heartfelt and more technical. without giving the ending away, i thought that the final scene was one of the most beautiful moments in political cinema history. the brilliant symbolism has stayed in my mind for the past two days after watching this film, while the rest of the movie quickly shuffled away from my mind. maybe a second viewing would do better for me, but for some odd reason silver city just didn't click with me. there seemed to be too many loopholes that were never explained or accounted for. an ensemble piece is always good with me, but when the characters are introduced without explanation, it just looses steam. this was one of those rare occasions.overall, i was very upset with this film. being very democrat, i wanted to see a side of politics that i wasn't aware of and another side that would make you chuckle. i wanted to be engulfed with the world of corporate money and the dufus' that are elected. i wanted intelligent humor framed by the words of george w., but instead all i found was a very confusing story aimed at a certain audience of which i will never be a part. sad, this picture had so much wasted promise.grade: ** out of *****

silver city (2+ outta 5 stars) as a huge fan of john sayles' work for many years now i feel safe in saying that this is the worst movie he has ever done. that said, the movie isn't exactly *terrible*... just very uninspired. sayles throws in familiar elements from his previous movies (corrupt politics, illegal immigration, the selling out of youthful ideals) but fails to bring them together in any new or meaningful way. even the dialogue (usually sayles' strong point) is disappointing this time around.. sounding clichéd and forced in almost every scene. the movie looks and sounds like episodes from a tv series that didn't make it past its third episode. there are tons of big stars on hand... and they try their best to make their bit parts come alive... but the material just isn't there this time around. while filming a campaign spot a governor-hopeful (a poor and obvious george w bush stand-in) fishes a dead body out of a lake. an investigator is hired to try and warn away people who may have deliberately set this up to discredit the candidate... but he soon finds out that there are deeper and darker (and more clichéd) secrets to be discovered. sayles has made similarly-themed movies so much better in the past ("lone star", "matewan", "return of the secaucus seven", "men with guns"). it's a shame that he went to the well one time too many and came up with tainted water. one good line, delivered by richard dreyfuss: "danny, you're a loser. that's already been established beyond doubt. so just try and be a good one, okay?"

this movie was horrible and the only reason it was even made was because the story appealed to the far-left. i consider my self a moderate, so i was able to see this film as the pile of garbage it was. while i'm not a bush fan, your dislike for gw is not enough of a reason to see this movie.to start, the movie was shot on such low-grade film that it comes off as cheap, rather then artsy. additionally, the characters are seriously lacking in depth. chris cooper's character was a poor parody of george bush; better suited for saturday night live then a dramatic film. the rest of the characters are walking clichés and are poor facsimiles of other characters from much better movies.avoid this movie at all costs!

apparently the film has a harsh anti-bush message... if it does (i didn't get it), that's all it is. it's boring and useless, period.it's too serious at times to be a comedy, too slow to be a thriller, not funny, not gripping, not exciting, not film. it's too everything to be the opposite, and vise versa. i was amazed at how bad a film could suck. don't even think of watching it.i have watched literally hundreds of films, and never have i been so obliged to write a warning on imdb. avoid at all costs. you have been warned.even "the making of..." is painfully boring. it's just people talking gibberish with loads of inside jokes infront of a camera, sort of like a home movie. there even is a part where a guy takes you on a tour of the food that was consumed on the set by the film crew. still, beats the movie i guess...

honestly, one of the worst written, directed and acted movies i have ever seen. seemed like a made-for-tv movie. and a bad one at that. i cannot believe that people are still hiring danny huston after seeing him in this movie, or that they are still allowing john sayles to make films. my husband and i came across this movie on tv one night and got so bored with it, we ended up cleaning the house while it was on . . . and it still bored us! it made me think that critics have been so gullible with sayles' previous films, such as lone star, which was raved about at he time but didn't really add up to much in the end. spend your time on something better. anything.

generally political messages are done on television, so if you are a big fan of environmental correctness, watch to your hearts content. most people go to the movies to be entertained, not sold some poppycock political nonsense. the hook here is the big name cast. unfortunately the sum of the performances equals a whole movie that went absolutely nowhere. the two best performances, chris cooper, and richard dreyfus, have minimal screen time. in short, "silver city" is to be avoided as entertainment. it is nothing more than a non documentary, rambling political expose on illegal immigration, pollution, and any number of other causes that do not belong anywhere except on the small screen. - merk

i don't really consider myself a conservative, so i wasn't personally offended by this film, but it was pretty clear that the plot and the characterization in this film were secondary to the message. and the message is that all conservatives are either evil or stupid (or both). the characters are one-dimensional -- either good, freedom-loving americans, or brainless, greedy, evil conservatives. there's nothing clever or creative, just anti-conservative. i don't really mind the political bias itself, but it shouldn't be the only purpose behind the movie. and clearly it is.on the positive side, the cast is wonderful and chris cooper's impression of w is funny the first two or three times, but after that it's just the same old joke being told over and over again.so if you really hate the conservatives, you'll probably enjoy this film, but if you're looking for something with realistic characters and a story that's less black-and-white, then you'd be better off watching something else.

i just saw this movie on tnt and let me tell you, this movie was downright corny and cheezy. but after a certain point, i began to laugh my socks off and to tell you the truth, they should classify this movie as comedy rather than action/adventure. the absolutely most hilarious scene comes when the delon and kennedy are making loop the loop 360's to avoid the french missiles that wagner ordered to destroy the concorde. our fearless leader, kennedy, decides to shoot flares out the window to stop the heat seeking missiles????? dumb yet funny---the kicker comes here though---after one shot, the flare gun malfunctions and kennedy tries to fix it in the cockpit and well...if you want to know what happens get a hold of this movie. the dumb parts of this movie include the total lack of plot----yeah lets have some action for 25 minutes than land in paris and go one hour with love scenes with prostitutes and flight attendants. now lets switch to the saboteur for ten minutes then a wasted rest of the movie and a plane that is visually breaking apart and the passengers don"t even see it???? its right in front of their eyes!!!!-----final rating for this move--- (1/10) out of 4 stars if it were action 2 out of 4 stars if it were a comedy

its a truly awful movie with a laughable storyline.some awful acting.and a script that ed wood might be ashamed of.wagner is laughable in this. he plays his role like number two in austin powers.easily the worst of the airport movies.1 out of 10

'airport 4' is basically a slopped together mess for universal studios to try and work a new twist - the concorde supersonic airliner - into their 'disaster-in-the-sky' formula.bogged down with unintentional humor, the best of which is when george kennedy sticks his hand out of concorde's window at supersonic speed to fire a flare gun at a heat-seeking missile following the aircraft's flight path, and the simple fact that these dumb passengers keep re-boarding the same plane to continue their flight despite all the problems in the air. many stars in this one including robert wagner, sylvia kristel, alain delon, and martha raye as a nervous passenger. not really related to the other 'airport' films.

the concorde ... airport '79 starts in washington where a man named carl parker (macon (mccalman) contacts high profile tv news reporter maggie whelan (susan blakely) in order to hand secret documents over that prove his boss kevin harriosn (robert wagner) owner & president of harrison industries that develop weapons for the military has been illegally selling said weapons to foreign countries. however maggie sees carl assassinated & she barely escapes with her life, maggie is to catch the concorde to moscow via paris the next morning & intends to blow the whistle on harrison who also happens to be her boyfriend which would ruin him. determined to save himself he reprogrammes his hi-tech 'buzzard' homing missile to intercept & destroy the concorde during a test run killing all those on-board & destroying the documented evidence...renamed airport '80 - the concorde for it's cinema & initial home video releases because it was released here in, well, 1980 rather than 1979 this last entry in the airport franchise was directed by david lowell rich & is a notoriously bad film that was apparently laughed at during press & test screenings prompting universal to promote the film as an action comedy. the first thing to say is that the concorde ... airport '79 is a really silly & downright daft film but on a purely entertainment basis i can think of a lot worse films to spend 108 minutes watching, i really can. i quite liked the absurd plot about a wealthy industrialist wanting to kill his girlfriend tv reporter before she can expose him as an illegal arms dealer but this guy doesn't do subtle & decides the best way to do it is to blow concorde up with his own guided missile & then gets a fench fighter pilot to try & shoot it down before finally sabotaging it so really there's three mini disaster flicks in one here as each time super pilot joe patroni manages to save the day. you know joe patroni played by george kennedy appears in all four airport films & goes from mechanic in the first to concorde pilot extrodinaire in this, also i reckon he's a bit of a jinx since in the space of nine years he has been involved with four major aviation disasters. i think the real reason why the airport series stopped here was because patroni retired after this & the jinx was lifted. some of the things that happen here are just silly, patroni does barrel rolls, flies upside-down & out manoeuvre's a guided missile in a huge concorde not to mention he crash lands it & fires flare guns out of his window to destroy the missile all while keeping a calm head. this guy is good, very good. then there's the character's, there's a saxophone playing black dude who smokes weed in the toilets, an old woman with a bladder problem & a team of russian gymnasts with bad accents. also, despite being almost shot down with a missile & then attacked by a jet fighter the passengers of concorde don't seem that bothered & happily get back aboard the following day, i don't know about you but after that i would probably find a safer way to travel & why do the police or authorities not question anyone? why is the concorde captain patroni allowed to just go off & sleep with a french prostitute? the concorde ... airport '79 certainly isn't boring & is full of memorable moments & i was entertained in a way although it's far from a good film & modern audiences may not have the patience with it, hell i liked it for what it was in a daft way but it's no sort of classic.even though concorde no longer flies it's still quite a cool looking air-plane & there's plenty of footage of it here, the one used in the concorde ... airport '79 was the seventh one built. this concorde was also the same aircraft which crashed after a tire bust caused a fuel tank to rupture and the leaking fuel catch fire on july 25th 2000, while taking off in paris sadly resulting in the death of 109 passengers and crew on board and 4 people on the ground. when this aired on tv in the us in 1982 almost twenty minutes of new footage was included with most if not all of it being newly shot over two years after the original production had finished. i know the effects here take a bashing from most but i don't reckon they are too bad, when you consider this was made in the late 70's i think they come across quite well. the camera moves during effects shots, real footage of real planes is used rather than toy models which in my opinion would have looked a lot worse & i could certainly see what the makers were trying to do with limited funds & limited technology. in a strange way they are quite impressive actually without ever looking that good if you know what i mean. probably the most action packed of all the airport films there's missiles, exploding planes, daring crash landings, assassinations & a guy named robert palmer (no, not the singer) giving head a woman in a jacuzzi.the imdb says this had a budget of about $14,000,000 which is actually more than i thought, maybe those special effects aren't so impressive after all. shot in utah, washington, los angeles & france. the acting isn't great here, people don't look worried enough that they are about to die. goerge kennedy gets some bad one-liners while robert wagner plays the bad guy.the concorde ... airport '79 is fun for bad film enthusiasts everywhere & to be brutally honest i rather watch this entertaining mess of a film than some two hour oscar nominated bore.

there is a special heaven reserved for people who make the world laugh. alongside chaplin,stan and ollie,the marx bros and.....(fill in your own special favourites)space must be made for everybody connected with "airport 80 - concorde,the movie". robert wagner in particular exceeds all expectations giving the comedy performance of a lifetime.i would never have thought he had it in him. the only way he could have been funnier would have been to have worn a red nose and a revolving bow tie. british moviegoers will recognise the fat one from cannon and ball pretending to be a russian athlete,a nice trick if he could have pulled it off but,tragically,he couldn't.i have a 14 year old labrador more athletic and almost as funny. george kennedy - bless him - has a part that requires him talk and move at the same time,and my goodness he triumphs!brow wrinkled with effort he utters timeless dialogue,each word lovingly polished into coward-like brilliance. only once in twenty years does hollywood turn out a film like "airport 80".all the years of toil and struggle,the sweat,the tears,the lessons with lee strasberg,living out of suitcases,born in a trunk etc etc,all come to fruition.a work of art is created that will last as long as there are movies and machines to show them on. i think i'm ready for my medication now.

this film is an absolute disgrace! i thoroughly enjoyed the original airport, and i can't believe how the same people could produce this twaddle nine years on. first of all, the acting is bad. the original had actors who had done quality (non-disaster) films before, but this one uses actors who have done the disaster movie circuit already (blakely, kennedy, wagner). also, george kennedy's character patroni seems to get promoted very quickly. he is now the lead in the film, but his character isn't strong enough to carry it off: he has lost the charm and humour of airport (1970), and the character is now just boring. have i mentioned the plot? is it at all believable that someone would send a missile after the concorde?? no!!! there are also too many loose ends; scenes that have no relevance whatsoever to the plot. the scene where the hot air balloon lands on the runway, the chase of the thief in charles de gaulle airport are two such scenes. both would be interesting - if only they had something to do with the actual story. there also many unanswered questions: why does patroni open the window and fire a flare at the other plane? why does robert wagner's character kill himself? (he must have another stupid and costly way of why is there no enquiry after the missile almost blows up the concorde? why are the back projections so bad? (it looks as though a cartoon missile is following the concorde; although it does work well when the plane lands in paris) why does patroni think that he is in a flight simulator? (when he turns the concorde over) why does he get a hero's welcome in the cabin of the plane after having terrified the passengers? and why is the ending so poor, if it can be called an ending at all? given their one-dimensional-ness, no-one seems to notice this. the blessing given to the young couple on the plane by the girl's coach is shmaltzy, the man who plays the saxophone is annoying, and the woman with the bladder problem is just plain silly. the scenes where susan blakely is lying on the roof of her conservatory, and the when she tells wagner that she still loves him are quite awful. in conclusion, this film should have been the climax of the previous three airport films: instead it is a diabolical, sub-moronic, complete and utter waste of time, money, energy, celluloid and "talent"!!!!!!! remember when patroni asks the french pilot if he has "ever landed on his belly?" this film certainly does the belly flop, and lands flat on its pointy nose...

warning **spoilers**lord knows i have seen some bad movies in my time and this one makes me just as angry. this is an insult to people who are looking for a bad movie. the "story" involves a stewardess who discovers her boyfriend (badly acted by otherwise great robert wagner) is a murder, thief, and just an overall puke face. after the concorde takes off, he sends guided missiles to destroy the concorde. so while the concorde is traveling at the speed of light, our "hero" (played with utter stupidity, george kennedy) opens the window in the cockpit then, sticks his hand out the window to fire at the missile! i'm no rocket scientist, but it seems his hand would at least get a wind burn. then towards the final "climax" when the concorde is headed for certain disaster and everyone will die, a passenger turns to his fiance and proposes marriage. a priest just happens to be sitting in the next row and proceeds to marry them as the planes is crashing! (i'm not making this up) wow, the guy who wrote the script must have been sniffing glue for a week.

i gave "airport '79" only two stars because it's a truly lousy film. nobody who had anything to do with it deserves any praise (except for charo's chihuahua, who does a pretty good job in his role.) this is not to say that the film isn't worth watching. it helps if you have a buzz on, but this is not essential.a'79 really does seem like an early version of "airplane!" every scene has a set-up and a payoff, and the scenes blunder after one another as if they were totally disconnected. one of my favorite recurring points is that the passengers, crew, and airplane get to keep going, no matter what. you're a news reporter and a strange guy gets murdered at your house in your presence? the hit-man then chases you onto your greenhouse roof? no problem. you can still catch that early-morning flight to paris...no need to get the cops involved. your plane dodges one unmanned "drone" missile, four heat-seeking missiles, and cannon fire from an unidentified phantom fighter, doing barrel rolls, an unpowered dive, and a crash-net landing without thrust reversers in the process? no problem, we'll have the mechanics check the oil and get you on your way in just a few hours. it's truly funny.and i'll admit that there's a bit of the anarchist in me that comes out when the passengers pay no attention to the cabin attendants. the highlight is when the attendant tells jimmie walker he'll have to put away his saxophone (god spare me from a flight seated in front of a saxophonist playing jazz!) prior to take-off. jimmie basically says, "nope." later in the flight, the sax is damaged during a barrel-roll and jimmie actually shows up on the next leg of the flight with yet another sax that he won't put away. this aspect of the film is just fun. (one passenger actually obeys the attendant. when charo is told she can't take her dog on the flight, she leaves the plane. naturally, this is because you can't get a good view of her ass and boobs while she's seated.) in summary, a terrible movie, but terrible enough to be a bit amusing. unfortunately, the filmmakers and cast deserve no credit whatsoever for this, as it was probably entirely unintentional.

my take: the silliest of the airport movies, and probably one of the worst of the 70's disaster movies.as if to milk the franchise with all its got, the producers of this third sequel to airport throws in more action, silly subplots, gratuitous star appearances and goofier elements. in its attempt to be the biggest airport yet, concorde: airport '79 is the worst one yet, and probably one of the worst of the disaster movies of the 1970's. with its bad box-office results, it is no wonder that the genre has overstayed its welcome.the film opens with a rather catchy score by lalo schifrin backed-up by some impressive shots of the titular aircraft in its former glory (the same plane used in this film would be involved in a crash in july 2000). but then the credits appear, and we get a glimpse of the "all-star" cast, which is composed nothing more of faded hollywood stars, tv actors and none-too-popular b actors. the plot is sillier than ever: george kennedy is back in the role of joe patroni, now the pilot of the concorde (co piloted by co-pilot alain delon) en route to france after the summer olympics. on board is reporter maggie whelan (susan blakely), who has just discovered that his boyfriend, renowned weapons manufacturer kevin harrison (robert wagner), is selling their weapons to terrorist. to prevent her from revealing the news to the world, harrison sends his most advance missiles and best saboteurs to prevent the concorde from landing.the cast/subplots are dumber than ever, even sillier than an alcoholic myrna loy or a singing nun. we have cicely tyson transporting a live human heart in a cooler (!), martha raye as a woman with a bladder condition (and the character doesn't go deeper than that), j.j. walker a a pot-smoking saxophonist (arguably the most annoying character in the film), eddie albert married to "old" wife sybil danning, avery schreiber as russian coach with a deaf daughter and finally, a love story between reporter jon davidson and gymnast andrea marcovici (much to the sour watching-eye of coach mercedes mccambidge). plus the movie gets much closer to love boat episode than ever with the silliest cameos of charo (and her pet chihuahua) and bibi anderson. camp buffs will no doubt get a real kick-in-the-balls in this silly entry in a long strain of 70's disaster movies. this one is, in more than the sense of the word, a true disaster.rating: *1/2 out of 5.

olivier assayas' film stars asia argento as a woman who had a relationship with michael madsen. madsen is a business man who's in financial trouble. in desperation he is going to sell his share of a business to a company called golden eagle, a company from the far east. as madsen begins his moves away from his company asia argento returns to his life. the pair had a torrid love affair that included her doing business favors for madsen (with said golden eagle). once argento enters the film the film follows her as we see the tangled web she's woven and how the complications spin dangerously and violently out of control.i'm not a fan. actually i was quite bored as the film seems to go from pillar to post for much of the first hour during which i kept wondering what the point was other than to provide a meaty role for argento. argento, daughter of director dario argento and a director in her own right, is a unique actress. at times stunningly good, she is more often then not going to give you a quirky off beat portrayal of a damaged human being. sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. i don't think it completely works here mostly because the script is too "complicated" to support it. i didn't care what was going on so her wounded girl just rubbed me the wrong way(she seemed more nut job than anything else). i'm not blaming the actors but writer/director assayas who has once again constructed a complicated tale with the sort of parts actors love to tackle, but which leave audiences scratching their heads because they they don't really work. if you must try it on cable

asia argento has never done a film (so far as i know, and this includes ones directed by her own father, dario) where she fails to show all of her anatomy at some point. sure enough, in the most boring opening dialogue scene ever, poor madsen has her coming into his office and right there, reminding us that even though her hair is up, she can still stick her fingers in her crotch at any given second (which she does but in such a random "what? am i really seeing that?" kind of way). the dvd box, packaging, makes this look like a femme fatale film so you keep waiting to see her turn into a sleek and minimalist killer.. no such luck. she's verbose, hung up on some aging has been and even worse, has no credible skills in physical agility other than (surprise!) taking off all the clothes when any scene allows it. her accented english would be cool if only she didn't try to make it sound so affected and try to talk like a 12 year old. how about this plot? weak-minded but simultaneously nymphomaniacal woman is suddenly driven to kill while she already has another affair on the go and is running some cheap drug deal ... huh? what? does anyone have motivation in this movie to do anything other than buy a hamster? the screenplay seems to be oriented by letting everyone talk a lot about the same things over and over (i was expecting to see the worst acting on this appear as a producer who dumped money in it just to have some screen time) - there is nothing going on sub the obvious flaws of asia's character that at any point in the movie delivers what the dvd cover promises. she's weak... but she knows how to kill. she flails a lot. she flails naked, she flails half dressed, she even flails in a dead woman's clothing.. she is very floppy and unmotivated. in fact "floppy" would have been a great name for this movie.. and a shot of asia passed out looking angry on the cover would have been a better representation ... there are actually shots of her eating airplane food!!! what's that about? the ending makes 0 sense - everyone is just annoyingly wishy washy in their intent and their execution of all objectives. the wife of lester doesn't deliver any real vengeance (taking someone to bad karoeke is life threatening but not really valid).. and lester just floats around without really making much proclaimation of anything. totally misleading key art... yeah, we know asia lost the baby fat of her first born but really, a whole movie trying to pretend like that's interesting enough to drive a film about a passive-aggressive chick is not worth your while. see point of no return instead.

you have to start worrying when you see that michael madsen is leading the cast of any movie. i wont go through the list of shame that is his movie career.i watched 45 minutes and still was not sure what really was going on. the movie consisted of a love hate relationship between madsen and argento, which basically was madsen insulting her, threatening violence and generally treating her like dirt. she on the other hand loves him, then shes doesn't, then she does, the she desires him, then she loves him again......whats wrong with you woman !!!! the script is awful, lousy soundtrack and pointless aggressive and crude sexuality which i believe was added to entice some viewers as the movie has little else to offer. i would have given the movie a 1 but it just about managed a 2 with a little excitement in the last 20 minutes. it did actually answer one question in the final few minutes but i am not going to share that, i will make you suffer for the full movie like i did.

if you're an average guy like me and enjoy good acting, good plot, good scripts, novel ideas, or being entertained, you might want to skip this one. i was honestly bored from the opening credits to the very end, but tried to give the film a chance, and watched it all the way through -- only to be disappointed at every turn.the acting was unbelievably sub par, but i'm not sure if the actors themselves are to blame or if it was the ridiculously wooden and horrible dialog coupled with an even worse script. the plot is very vague and underdeveloped and i think the audience is supposed to derive some kind of deeper meaning from it, or be able to look past it in some way, but honestly to do so would be a waste of time.the film has a kind of crude sexuality to it which doesn't serve any purpose other than to show off some tattoos and lingerie. no one seems to have any motivation except making money off of some kind of "investment" deal that is never really explained. the connections between the characters aren't terribly clear, and there is little to no character development.this is either some kind of sub-culture film meant for a very specific audience to enjoy or absolute crap, but you can decide for yourselves.i gave it a 2 because it is definitely one of the worst films i've ever seen, but probably not the worst.

a quick resumé: almost nonexistent, badly chosen musical soundtrack, steady-cam filming done without the steady but with lots of coffee and a hyperactive cameraman, no plot, and nothing ever really happens. the film goes from one dialog into another, sounding hollow, never achieving depth, never creating the illusion that you really are inside a cobweb of conspiracy, and the everybody-has-an-affair-with-everybody is just a boring excuse to show the main actress in nice underwear. (which, combined with her rusty voice certainly is nice, but nothing to base a movie on) the high point for me is the opening scene, and the film just degraded from there to a point where i just wanted to quit the film about 45 minutes into the story. i regret sitting it out.

well another shootem up. typical run around film with guns, revenge, and violence. not much of a story. in fact i forgot most of what this film is about. don't rent this one. i think the exercise infomertial would be more entertaining during late night.

the movie is not that bad, ringo lam sucks. i hate when van damme has love in his movies, van damme is good only when he doesn't have love in his movies.

the story: alain, a french policeman, is shocked to discover that he had a twin brother when his body is found in nice. investigating the murder, he finds out that he was in possession of a list that details the deeds of the russian mafia. helped by his brother's girlfriend, alain dodges russian gangsters & corrupt fbi agents while trying to find the list."maximum risk" is another one of the long list of action films that feature jean-claude van damme. as far as things go, it is strictly formulaic. the script sticks to the clichés & the acting is mediocre. there are some nicely done action sequences, with an inventive car chase, a fight in a burning building, an escape through rooftops, a brutal fight in an elevator & jcvd fleeing his enemies over an elevated train line. director ringo lam keeps everything going at a reasonable pace.

i am a fan of good historical fiction, and was thrilled at the thought that someone would take a well written book series and film it. writing scripts is not like writing regular fiction, but when you have a book you are adapting, it would be nice to actually follow the plot line.the portrayals of the vespasians (the actual emperor, and his 2 sons titus and domitian) was horrid. they acted like a cookie cutter caligula, and were the 'bad guys' in this adaptation. there was a scene with titus dispensing justice as if he was caligula (from the movie of the same name.) the way the vespasianii are portrayed in the books mostly follow the reports of historians writing in that time period - they were fair, and sane, not tainted by the imperial claudian insanity.helena (the love interest of marcus didius falco) gives as her reason for divorcing pertinax (one of the traitors referenced in the title) was that he was a traitor, yet in the books it was because he ignored her and she felt that she would be better off marrying someone who valued her as a person.marcus in the movie gets a slave named justus, yet in the books he could barely afford his apartment, let alone afford a slave. there was certainly no romantic interlude between the nonexistent slave justus and a female gladiator...on the whole, if you want good cookie cutter roman stereotypes get caligula, if you want good roman from the classical history viewpoint, get i, claudius.

this film is about two female killers going on a tour to kill random men they meet.wow, "baise-moi" just became the worst film of all time in my list. the plot is crazy, pointless and unnecessary. the whole film is full of violence and sex, and i am sure no sane parents would want to show this film to their children. i don't understand what people get out of by making this film, or watching this film. maybe someone somewhere has their perverted desires fulfilled. there is simply no excuse or reasons for the existence of this perverted and depraved piece of work.the only consolation i offer myself is that i watched it on fast forward, so that i have not wasted as much time.

a movie about a french girl who gets raped by street hoodlums. the rape scene itself is shot in all it's gory detail with all the male and female organs and their interactions clearly visible to the camera. in a fit of rage, the victim grabs her friend's (or was it brother ?) gun, shoots him and runs off with the weapon. she meets this prostitute who has just seen her pimp shot down, they team up, and make off towards paris. a series of crazy, meaningless and wild killings follow, the girls seem to enjoy every murder more than the one before. one poor guy gets shot in the ****hole. there are good doses of sex thrown in between the numerous killings.the movie is not the most violent i have seen, i would say saving private ryan probably had more violence in it. if violence is what you are looking for, then there are lots of other movies out there. and if it's sex you are out for, then i would suggest one of those xxx ones.i went to see the movie because of all the hype the media was giving it. the movie itself is no big deal, just a lot of violence and sex shot with something like a hand-held camera. i was surprised this movie had a 15 year age limit in sweden, if 15 year-olds can watch this movie, they should be able to watch xxx movies too.

this is one of the rare movies that i did not immediately discuss with my friends after watching it. this wasn't because it had particularly entranced or impressed me. the contrary, it had given me nothing at all.why? because somehow, everything was so much overdone that i couldn't take this film seriously anymore. there was so much sex and violence that i got the strong impression that the film was trying very, very hard to be offensive, as if it was aiming at superlatives in ugliness, rather than in telling a convincing tale about two women caught in a spiral of crime.baise-moi had been described as "thelma & louise with actual sex" to me. well, it is true that the main idea is similar. there are two women traveling through the country because they've committed crimes and know that their lives are finished now, that the police are going to catch them, and they decide that now that everything's over anyway, there is no way to hold back.baise-moi had been described as a feminist film where women, who had suffered from male dominance in the past, exact revenge upon the men that they encounter.this is something that i had never interpreted into this film, simply because none of these women had ever been innocent, and because they do not just kill irresponsible, violent men, but also men that they seduce themselves, men that show the sense of wanting to do protected sex. and they kill women. no, they are in no way better than the characters that they encounter and murder in hideous, brutal ways.how easily the "heroines" decide to murder, and how much pleasure they take in it, made it absolutely impossible for me to relate to them in any way, or even take them seriously. it was just all too much. too much sex, too much violence. i got the feeling that sex and violence were only there in order to create a superlative in ugliness, rather than in conveying a story, or making a point.baise-moi left me with no impression, hadn't set me thinking, because it was so far removed from any real world. so constructed, unrealistic and over the top.there was nothing that i could do with this film, there was simply nothing about it to think about, other than "why did they make this terrible film?" had the intense unpleasantness going on in this film, served a purpose, i'd easily accepted it. but since i found nothing, since the film's story appeared to be not more than an excuse to squeeze as much and as ugly sex as possible into one film... i filed it away under "unnecessary torture", decided to never ever, ever, watch this film again, and i now consider this to be the worst film i've ever seen. worst, not just because it really isn't my cup of tea to watch people get raped, rape, have sex in other forms and kill one another... but because whatever it was that the makers wanted to tell the world with their film... if they wanted to say anything at all... it just didn't work. and there's nothing else that could save this film, because it's also filmed in such an ugly style.

i first saw a poster advertising this film on a street in helsinki, finland in june of 2000. what caught my attention was the proud proclamation advising all readers that the movie, although itself french, had been "banned in france". upon returning home to new york, i discovered that one of the "art house" movie theaters in the city was screening the film, and so (with my finnish fiancee) decided to see what all the fuss was about. boy, did we ever.from the comments read here, and the reviews i knew the movie was violent and sexually explicit. not necessarily offended by either of these two conditions, i went with an open mind to see what had perturbed the sensibilities of our gallic cousins. presumably, as anyone who is reading this will know, the story involves two women who embark on a crime and murder spree in france (the movie has english subtitles). the resemblance to "thelma and louise" however, ends with that; the sex is unusually graphic (and in copious supply) as is the violence (a lot of stomping to death, and a lot of blood and other organic matter splattering after bullet impact).on an intellectual level, one could make the case that the film's very essence is the relationship of sex and violence (as manifested by the only sex these women know: one is a small-time prostitute, and the other has earned money from time to time by performing in pornographic films. when they, during their descent into crime and murder, have the upper hand over their sexual situations, they react only with the same violence and brutality that they themselves know and understand. it is important to note, however, that the victims of their rampage are not only creepy men interested in creepy sex, (of which there are several)but innocent passersby, a woman at an atm, for example, as well.i myself do not really understand why the repeated "porn-movie" shots were all that necessary, (except to depict the physical contact as cruel, unpassionate and debased) and the unrelenting gore did get rather tedious after the first few violent spasms.it is a coarse and crude movie, but in fairness, it is dealing with coarse and crude people and equally unpleasant circumstances. from one point of view, the lives of the french underclasses is explored, and it's pretty grim; a travelogue for france it definitely is not- perhaps that's why the french banned it.

saimin (usa: the hypnotist /uk: hypnosis) aspect ratio: 1.85:1sound format: dolby stereo srfollowing a series of bizarre and apparently unrelated 'suicides', an experienced tokyo detective (ken utsui) enlists the help of a young psychoanalyst (goro inagaki) who believes the victims were acting on a post-hypnotic suggestion. but their subsequent investigations reveal an even darker force at work, linked to a young girl (miho kanno) whose life has been blighted by sadistic abuse...based on a novel by keisuke matsuoka, this densely-plotted mystery takes inspiration from a variety of sources (italian gialli, traditional japanese ghost stories, etc.), though some of the images in the climactic showdown reveal a more immediate influence: the recent commercial success of hideo nakata's ring (1998). for all its ambition, however, saimin is a routine potboiler which stumbles badly after a powerhouse opening (the 'suicides' are particularly impressive, despite some feeble cgi effects), though director masayuki ochiai - who co-wrote the script with yasushi fukuda - rallies proceedings for an extended finale in which the narrative's startling secrets are finally revealed. ochiai is best known for his film adaptation of novel-turned-video-game parasite eve (1997) - which also starred leading man inagaki (a member of japanese pop group smap) - and while saimin echoes that movie's strong visual sense, it falls short as drama, and most of the characters are mere ciphers, undermining the storyline's emotional pay-off. which is a shame, because the final half hour is galvanized by a series of dynamic set-pieces - most notably, a concert hall sequence in which dvorak's 'new world' symphony is transformed into an instrument of murder! - and ochiai is well-served by an excellent production team. however, those lured by the promise of gory carnage may be disappointed - the film is long on atmospherics and short on splatter.performances are varied, due to the script's limitations, but kanno (tomie) is outstanding as a young woman suffering from multiple personality disorder - which, the subtitles on the print under review assures us, isn't recognized as a viable medical condition in japan! - who falls prey to a sleazy tv hypnotist (takeshi masu), a prime suspect in the murders. inagaki is bland in a one-dimensional role, and he's constantly upstaged by utsui, a veteran performer whose career stretches back to the "sûpâ jaiantsu" series of the 1950's.(japanese dialogue)

leon errol handles his double role of uncle matt lindsay and lord basil epping superbly, but i have trouble liking the "mexican spitfire" series because they all are contrived to produce mistaken identities, and these are telegraphed way in advance. errol is funny as the stuffy lord epping, but i would have preferred a lot more wit and much less repetition. 

intended as light entertainment, this film is indeed successful as such during its first half, but then succumbs to a rapidly foundering script that drops it down. harry (judd nelson), a "reformed" burglar, and daphne (gina gershon), an aspiring actress, are employed as live window mannequins at a department store where one evening they are late in leaving and are locked within, whereupon they witness, from their less than protective glass observation point, an apparent homicide occurring on the street. the ostensible murderer, miles raymond (nick mancuso), a local sculptor, returns the following day to observe the mannequins since he realizes that they are the only possible witnesses to the prior night's violent event and, when one of the posing pair "flinches", the fun begins. daphne and harry report their observations at a local police station, but when the detective taking a crime report remembers harry's criminal background, he becomes cynical. there are a great many ways in which a film can become hackneyed, and this one manages to utilize most of them, including an obligatory slow motion bedroom scene of passion. a low budget affair shot in vancouver, even police procedural aspects are displayed by rote. the always capable gershon tries to make something of her role, but mancuso is incredibly histrionic, bizarrely so, as he attacks his lines with an obvious loose rein. although the film sags into nonsense, cinematographer glen macpherson prefers to not follow suit, as he sets up with camera and lighting some splendidly realised compositions that a viewer may focus upon while ignoring plot holes and witless dialogue. a well-crafted score, appropriately based upon the action, is contributed by hal beckett. the mentioned dialogue is initially somewhat fresh and delivered well in a bantering manner by nelson and gershon, but in a subsequent context of flawed continuity and logic, predictability takes over. the direction reflects a lack of original ideas or point of view, and post-production flaws set the work back farther than should be expected for a basic thriller.

the emperor's (richard haydn) dog is betrothed to johanna's (joan fontaine) dog. however, when virgil (bing crosby) arrives in town to sell a gramaphone record player to the emperor, his dog is attacked by johanna's dog. after a revenge attack where virgil is banished from town, a psychoanalyst insists that johanna's dog must confront virgil's dog so that she can overcome her doggy fears. this is arranged and the dogs fall in love. so do virgil and johanna. the rest of the film passes by with romance and at the end, johanna's dog gives birth. but who is the father.......? the dog story is the very weak vehicle that is used to try and create a story between humans. its a terrible storyline. there are 3 main musical pieces all of which are rubbish - bad songs and dreadful choreography. its just an extremely boring film - bing has too many words in each sentence and delivers them in an almost shouty, irritating manner. its not funny............ ever..........but its meant to be. bing and joan have done much better than this.

this is a movie about a black man buying a airline company and turning the company into a african-centric over the top airliner. they even portray the owner as not only being in control of the airline, but also controlling part of the air terminal at the airport. one day this guy wins $100 million dollars a the next time you see him, he is walking all over the airport acting like the owner of the airport. everyone calls this movie a parody, but nothing about this movie shouts parody! this movie is a flop and will forever be in the $4.95 bin at wal-mart.i can't even come to terms to why mgm would waste 16 million dollars on this movie. this movie doesn't even warrant straight-to-video status. the writers (one black and one white) should be blackballed from hollywood forever. not only do they over-stereotype blacks, they portray them as ignorant human beings. i would be ashamed of going to a movie that constantly humiliates me. don't waste your time at the video store, wal-mart, pay-per-view, or on a sunday afternoon when the movie is shown on tbs.

alright lets break it down. why is this one of the worst films ever? because there are so many answers to that question i'm having a headache. come on...cracker world? mr. honkee? the part with the arab guy? its just awful, i didn't really care about the whole white racism crap, but when they did that thing with the arab guy, i wanted to get the names of all the writers. its really not worth watching 3 seconds of this movie. it isn't even funny-bad which was my first interpretation. i hope the person who directed this movie doesn't commit suicide, but it seems likely, i don't see any other options.don't ever watch this movie, if you watch it, u cant say u died with no regrets.

i'll be honest-- the pimped out purple plane with snoop dogg at the helm is an amusing visual gag. it would have been a decent concept for a 30 second commercial, or maybe a 3 minute music video. but the producers have committed the age-old concept comedy sin of stretching 30 seconds of material into an hour and a half of film, and the results are predictably lame. the remainder of the 89 minutes are filled with the typical gamut of racist and sexist humor and fart jokes, offensive and-- worst of all-- painfully unfunny. the threadbare plot screams under the weight of its contrivances. best to be avoided unless you are drunk or stoned.

if you just watched all dogs go to heaven, and learn that there's a sequel, don't watch it. it's horrible. it's absolutely awful. they rush the characters to develop. sasha, for example, begins singing about how you can count her out for love. and at the end, this seems more like a dramatic romance flick than a comedy-adventure film. they rip charlie out of his character and replace him with a gushy, soft, but still rebellious version of himself.the humor behind carface's character is just completely lost. he's a totally different dog. he doesn't have a cool voice anymore, he isn't that villain you love to hate anymore, he's just a wimp voiced by none other than mermaid man from spongebob. speaking of voice actors..charlie has a completely different voice. and while it isn't horrible, i don't like it. it's terrible in comparison to the excellent job that burt reynolds did for the character in the first film. dom deluise is wonderful as always, as itchy. that character stays true, and that's why this film gets a 3/10. purely because dom deluise was still voicing itchy.oh, and my last complaint. i know ann-marie's movie was done and gone, she has parents now, etc, but did charlie completely forget about her, or what? no mention at all of her in the second film. i mean, even a small mention from itchy would have been acceptable. (ex. "charlie, we have to get back. you can't take care of every kid that needs rescuing.) or something of the sort. i mean, he died living with her, she deserves some kind of mention.don't watch this if you're looking for a wonderful sequel.

i think that this is a disappointing sequel. i miss a lot of the old characters (king gator, anne marie, etc.), and i don't like it due to the fact that not even half of the original voices are back to do the characters. a lot of personality was lost in charlie, and the villain red is not even half as bad as carface was in the first one. if you're a big adgth fan like i am, it's worth seeing just to see how the story is continued, but don't count on it being 5 stars in your book.

first, they ruin it with the uniquely bad animation quality, then, they get voices that sound nothing like the original. they make sooo many movie mistakes. when sasha is singing in count me out, the drummer disappears and then reappears, itchy's shirt keeps changing color, his hat keeps changing position, one of the bridge is white, everyone in the background appears fat, halos keep changing colors and appearing and disappearing. even heaven appears different. i don't give a damn if this is a low budget film, they shouldn't cut corners on animation. they completely ruined the first adgth. the only good thing about this movie was the soundtrack.

all dogs go to heaven was a quirky, funny movie; with good name talent who's voices lended an adult familiarity to a cartoon basicly for kids. it was just interesting enough to be likeable by adults aside from something good for the kids to watch.unfortunately adgth2 is a valueless sequel trying to make a bit of cash rideing on the coattails of the first. charlie sheen is a passable replacement for burt reynolds in this second movie and sheena easton's voice in a few of the movies lovely but forgettable songs makes her a worthwhile pick as a co-star for this. add dom deluise from the first movie and you'd think this would be a decent mix to make this sequel at least relatively decent compared to the first one.unfortunately even with the addition of other good voice actors such as bebe neuwirth in the horrible role of anabelle, this movie cannot be saved from the atrocious production values and animation skills (or lack thereof) present all over this movie. horrible editing, syncronization of the voices, and flat out spaces where characters mouths should be moving to dialouge but are not combine to make this movie look like a college interns animation project instead of the decent sequel it could have been.all in all i'd say unless you were a very big fan of the first movie i'd give this a very large pass.

how could they take such a beautifully animated gem like don bluth's all dogs go to heaven and bastardize it with a charmless, cheesy, uninspired sequel. the haunting music and delightful characters are gone, now replaced with tacky animation and an unimaginative plot.the pros: charlie sheen is sometimes fun as charlie, but he lacks the charming tough guy attitude that brought him to life by burt reynolds. i did particularly enjoy the songs "i will always be with you" and "it's too heavenly here".the cons: there seems to be no connection between this and the original. in the beginning charlie is chums with carface, but wait a minute. isn't this the same character who was responsible for charlie's murder and kidnapped the sweet little orphan he loved? i guess that all changes in heaven but why isn't anne-marie even mentioned? if itchy makes it to heaven, wouldn't flo and killer make it too? what is with annabelle the whippet's voice? in the original it sounded feminine and charming and in the sequel it sounds like a whiny, bitchy, parrot. the new characters aren't all that great (except sasha). and the animation is better compared to a generic saturday morning cartoon. the constant cartoony "humor" is flat and unfunny and the "heart" just doesn't work when compare to the original, which had such a moving unsubtle touch that makes me cry every time.all dogs go to heaven is one of my all-time favorite films. how don bluth allowed this sequel to be made is beyond me.bottom line: not all sequels go to heaven.

movies like these do not need sequels. part of the advantage of don bluth moving away from disney is that he didn't need to suffer their endless tirade of straight-to-video, poorly animated cash-in sequels. but apparently it was someone's brilliant idea to make a sequel to "all dogs go to heaven," so we get this.charlie sheen replaces burt and he's not really as good. most of the film is just a poor excuse for a sequel and it isn't nearly as dark, different or entertaining as the original.i feel sorry for future generations who are going to have to suffer endless sequels like this without ever knowing what it was like to have a time when hollywood didn't totally rely on successful films as a crutch to release banal crap.please, no more sequels to kids films that don't need 'em.

this movie is... horrible and wonderful at the same time. i first saw it when i was about 13 or 14 years old, so it has a great deal of nostalgic value for me. in this movie, cesar romero actually plays the character of octavio, the man who "discovered" santana. there are also two other actors, monte markham (plays sam, who is trying to save his daughter) and peter mark richman (plays the priest), who have large filmographies, and these are the only performances that are okay. the rest of the acting and the movie itself have all of the b-film qualities that some of us cherish.i recently spent 2 years trying to acquire a copy of this movie, and it is almost nonexistent. i am assuming that it was discontinued very shortly after its release. but i did eventually find a copy and paid a pretty penny to acquire it. if you happen to come upon judgement day in a video store (unmistakeable with a cheesy green "satan" on the cover), count yourself among the blessed who live near one of the few video stores that still has a working copy. a must see for those of you who like to laugh at cheesy attempts at a scary movie.

this movie is so stupid that i want my $2.99 back that i paid for!! first this movie starts off with a bunch of wooden actor geeks with fill in talent like they got picked off the street somewhere because the "real" actors either did not show up because of the laughable script or they just couldn't get anybody desperate enough to do this movie! the music in this movie is enough to put you to sleep, flute music made for faerie's dancing in the wilderness wouldn't even be good enough for this movie! and the guy dressed up as satan looks like he's all dressed up in a k-mart halloween special costume! there are no dead scenes except a few lame scenes. when i saw what the terrible killers looked like in those bath robes with nosferatu faces i just laughed! this is what the whole town is supposed to be running away from once a year! this movie is one of the worst demonic movies i have ever seen. avoid this one!

a box with a button provides a couple with the opportunity to be financially free, but the cost is the life of someone they've never met. this is a very tedious film to watch. richard kelly, who wrote and directed it, decided to make a film without any payoff. you are taken on a ride of slow build ups, one after the other with minor revelations at best. at certain moments, i thought to myself, this will have major significance at the end, but nothing does. the film just leaves one thinking, "this story could have been told in 30 minutes, without all the stretched out nonsense." i will hope you avoid this god-awful film and maintain your sanity by doing so.

set in 1976 for no apparent reason other than to keep the set dressers busy, 'the box' was directed by richard kelly ('donnie darko'), and stars cameron diaz and james marsden as norma and arthur lewis, a young couple who are supposedly struggling financially even though they both have successful careers--she as a high school teacher, he as an optical specialist at nasa's langley, virginia, research center. they have one child, walter (sam oz stone).one day the lewises find a parcel on their doorstep, containing a black box with a big red button. there is a note from a 'mr. steward' indicating that he will return at 5:00 pm to explain about the box.the mysterious arlington steward, played by frank langella, shows up at the appointed time, nattily attired in an elegant savile row suit. he is polite but businesslike, however his most noticeable feature is his face, half of which appears to have been blown off and improperly attended to. langella is the only thing worth watching in the movie, however he is unfortunately upstaged by his own makeup, which resembles that of harvey 'two face' dent (aaron eckhart) from christopher nolan's 'the dark knight.' it's like the elephant in the room: one can try to ignore it, but it's more than a little distracting.steward explains that he will return in 24 hours to collect the button. if, during that time, they decide to unlock and push the button, he will give them $1 million cash. the only catch--and it's a big one--is that somewhere a stranger will die. it might be across town, it might be on another continent, however steward assures them the victim will be someone unknown to them. as a show of good faith, he leaves them with a crisp $100 bill, theirs to keep whether they push the button or not.arthur and norma are skeptical, believing the whole thing to be a scam or an elaborate hoax, however it isn't long before they begin to wonder what would happen if they did push the button? would they really get a million dollars? would somebody really die? weary of the speculation, norma slaps the button. nothing happens. however, their initial relief gives way to alarm when steward shows up the next day with a briefcase full of cash. they decide to call the whole thing off, however steward tells them it's too late. "you've already pushed the button," he explains. as steward's limo pulls away, arthur notes the license number, which he later discovers is registered to the nsa (national security agency).at this point the film begins to veer deeply into unfollowable territory as the secondary characters start springing nosebleeds and flashing peace signs. meanwhile, the town becomes invaded by pudgy, slack-jawed geeks in bad shirts who start following arthur around like an advance scouting party for a race of zombie alien nerds. arthur eventually becomes trapped by the menacing bookworms in the library (?), where steward's spinsterish wife shows up--whom we haven't seen till now--and informs arthur that in order to get out of the library he must step into one of three vertical columns of cheesy-looking digital water effects. 'what happens if i choose the wrong one?', arthur asks, seeming far less baffled than he ought to be under the circumstances, and certainly far less baffled than the audience is by this time. 'eternal damnation,' the spinster says ominously.arthur steps into the middle column of digital liquid effects, and after a brief absence suddenly appears, still in his water cocoon, hovering over norma's bed. when she wakes up and sees him, the water bubble bursts and arthur tumbles onto the bed in a shower of water which, oddly enough, continues to drip from the overhead water pipes just out of camera range while a sodden marsden and diaz flop around on the bed.it's confusing, i know.we eventually learn that steward was once the public relations officer for the nsa, until he was struck by a lightning bolt that destroyed part of his face. he was pronounced dead, but later came back to life, having been transformed into a sort of superman who now serves 'the ones who make the lightning,' and whose powers have enabled him to take over the cia, the nsa, and nasa all by himself.and what is the point of all this nattering rubbish? apparently, steward's mission is to subject humans to a kind of biblical character test (e.g., the 'binding of isaac'), to determine whether humanity is worth saving. if enough people pass the button test by refusing to push it, steward's god-like overlords will spare the race. unfortunately, those people who do push the button, such as norma and arthur, must be punished for their moral spinelessness, to which end they are subjected to a series of dreary 'lady or the tiger' ordeals that play out like one of those 'saw movies,' except without the entertaining gore or the benefit of a coherent plot.'the box' represents the sort of pointless mental masturbation that freshman philosophy students like to blather on about after a few beers. richard kelly's tedious exercise in existentialist pettifoggery eventually collapses under the weight of its own incomprehensibility; the tortured melange of insupportable ideas eventually congeals, as with the mixing together of too many colors, into a meandering gray goo of a film as insipid as one of those narcotizing in-flight movies the plot of which suffers no more or less from having been interrupted by a leisurely nap.there is a point in 'the box' where arthur, who is a technically-minded guy, becomes curious about how the button works. opening up the unit, he is disappointed to find nothing inside.having seen the box, i know exactly how he feels.

this must be the first movie i've rented and not seen to the end. complete garbage! the acting, the plot, set and wardrobe looked like it came from a porno movie with a plot. not even a b move.

without being really the worst science fiction film ever made, or the worst i have seen, 'time under fire' is still much under average. the premises and the first 10-15 minutes are not that bad, it starts as a x-files story, combining bermuda triangle mysteries with time travel. pretty soon elements of other genres (too many) mix together, but the story never takes off beyond the level of interest of a tv series. soon, 'time under fire' quickly degenerates into a series of clichés, not only mixing altogether too many genres but also being unable to create anything memorable in suspense or special effects that would help viewers remember the movie until tomorrow. acting is bad, and the rhetoric lines in the script do not help at all.

where do i begin? the story was so bad, it must have been written in a high school film club! the acting was so wooden i felt sorry for the actors! one actor even reminded me of what a deer must look like when staring into a car's headlights! another actor has this constant look of being constipated! but it was the dialog that takes the cake! our hero says to his captors - all holding submachine guns - if you lay a finger on a female prisoner you will be dead. moments later, the strongest guard, built like a truck, and the only women prisoner go at it. when our fearless leader, who has this very annoying raspy gangster voice catches wind of this transgression, he calmly walks up to the guard, while machine guns are trained on him, and in a split-second snaps this giant guy's neck like he was breaking a tooth pick! he then gets back in line while all the villains with their machine guns do absolutely nothing, but essentially yell at him!i could go on and on! this movie is camp gem; and if you have any sense of humor, it's guaranteed to make you laugh so hard your eyes will tear!

drab, dreary and a total waste of my time. the plot is incomprehensible (so don't think about it too much). the acting is odd and wooden - i would have sworn that they were all professional body builders trying their luck at acting, but that might be an insult to body builders. there are no interesting special effects to redeem this disaster, but lots of fires, explosions, a gratuitous sex scene, etc. the only thing that caught my attention was that it takes place after a war between the us and iraq that somehow goes nuclear...hmmm. is roger corman psychic? let's hope that "iraq" was just a lucky choice for corman and that the rest of his scenario doesn't come true. 

who's responsible for these "behind the scenes" things? who are these actors? did they crawl out from beneath rocks? 'yuks, lots of yuks!' no. no yuks for me. only loathing and shame that i am a human being. i have to avert my eyes from the set, it's so embarrassing. in fact, i changed the channel.i've always had a problem with robin williams' non-stop 'i forgot my lithium today' rantings, but at least he's funny once in a blue moon. watching someone who isn't funny at all impersonating robin williams is like having each tooth in your head pulled slowly and sadistically, without novocaine, for all eternity.please stop making these absolutely horrifying tv movies. please.

arthur hunnicutt plays a very stereotypical role as a mountain man (probably the ozarks) who goes hunting with his favorite coon dog. however, the dog appears to be drowning when hunnicutt jumps in after him. it becomes obvious pretty soon that despite hunnicutt and his dog roaming about after leaving the water that they both died in the water--as no one responds when he talks to them and sees and hears people talking about his and the dog's death. yet, oddly, hunnicutt is really slow on the uptake and it takes him a while to understand they are talking about him! i think this was actually done as padding, as there really wasn't enough material to fill the half hour time slot.later, in the "surprise twist", he comes upon heaven--or at least his concept of the place. he's invited in, but since they won't allow dogs, he has other ideas! overall, reasonably well acted but of dubious spiritual value! with no twists or irony, this episode is a bit dull--not "twilight zone-y" enough for my tastes.

as a south african, living in south africa again after a 32 year stay in the uk, i am sorry to say that this movie is a huge disappointment. the three main problems i had with the movie was a) why swank and ejiofor - an american and a nigerian - to play the leads. this country is bursting with talent and has no need of imports... b) gillian slovo has been trading off her struggle credentials for years now. she's a very mediocre writer and even her novel doesn't stand up the flaccid direction of mr hooper... and c) hilary swank again, such a great actor, as proved in million dollar baby (but that's eastwood too), here dressed in the contemporary new york style whilst roaming freely around the poverty of the karoo. where was the consideration and sensitivity needed by the costumer and director? yes, the film is ultimately moving - how could it not be? - but the overall mood at the conclusion is one of tremendous letdown. heart's in the right place but needs a pace maker.

that is what this movie is. good god the special effects suck in this movie. it is difficult for anything to suck more than this movie's plot, but the special effects manage to pull it off. let me try to explain just how bad this movie is.first, there is the plot. there are four punk-ass teenage dirt bikers who are riding around in a forest in duluth, mn. one of them is a dumb-ass and tries a ridiculous jump and breaks his leg. a paramedic comes to help him, but gets stranded with them when the helicopter breaks. then all five realize that there is a forest fire, which we see is started by some guy dumping tons of gas all over the forest. all they show us is his boots, and they show scene after scene of this guys boots walking around dumping gas and starting fires. meanwhile, the teenagers try to escape the fire, only to find that boot man has somehow managed to get ahead of them (while they were speeding through the forest on dirt bikes!), dump gas all over the area they were riding through, and start more fires. he does this several times, and the paramedic finally catches him and starts him on fire. i won't spoil the ending, but this guy's resilience will have you shouting "what the bloody hell?!?!" at the screen. anyway, they are now surrounded by fire, and their only escape is through a mine which is filled with methane gas. yes, methane gas. i'm not even going to try to describe the ending, because it is too ridiculous, and you'll enjoy it more if you don't see it coming. which you won't, because you can't possibly expect what happens. this is because of the second major problem with this movie: consistency.is some semblance of consistence too much to ask for? apparently so. i cannot even count the number of broken limbs in this movie (they keep breaking arms and legs while crashing their bikes). i think each character breaks at least one limb, and several more than one. they then limp around until the scene ends, and then forget that they're supposed to have broken limbs. there is one scene where three of them who are supposed to have broken legs start dancing. but then their injuries suddenly return when the plot needs them to.finally, the cgi. if there is a hell, it consists of watching the fire in this movie. all they did for the forest fires is line the dirt paths with cgi fire. you can clearly see that the only cgi fire is along the paths, and all of the trees more than two feet from the path are left untouched. and then they zoom out and show the whole forest being engulfed in flames. it's hard to describe in words how ridiculous it looks, but i assure you that the ridiculousness is quite impressive.this movie is one of those so-bad-its-good types. there are some occasions where it descends into the painful-bad category, but for the most part it stays above the line and is laughably inept. i can't wait to check out the other nature unleashed movies that came in the four-pack with this one.

ah the sci-fi channel. how often do you disappoint me? quite often i think, do you ever show good movies? ok you have given me the great 'heroes' and the reasonably good 'the lost room' but they are series, and as for the movie well there really is nothing positive to say. bad acting, bad directing, terrible characters and a shallow story, and that is just for starters. i checked out the director allan a goldstien and was not surprised to find nothing of interest in his resume (in fact i am half thinking that this is a pseudo name). the premises of four motor bikers out motto-crossing in a national park when one of them has an accident that needs a park ranger to come rescue them only for them to get caught in a forrest fire is weak and predictable that you know every beat before it happens. leading man bryan genesse the park ranger is so bad it is terrible. cast as the action hero martial arts boy in the footsteps of so many others this guy makes seagal and van damme look like de nero. the supporting cast are little better and well before the end one was left hoping the fire would engulf them all then the film crew. avoid at all costs

i thought it will be a ok movie after seeing the commercials about it. it was funny at some parts and some very nasty. the only person i felt sorry for is horatio sans who got a hot wife who is cheating on him with other women. but he never got a chance to have a threesome with until the and that was good but they should have made more bigger thru out the film.

this movie is one of the worst i've ever seen. even being hangover didn't help. the plot is lousy, if existent. the relatively large number of beautiful girls are unable to help. i guess seeing an episode of temptation island with the sound turned of would give the same kind of experience. do not see this flick

the guidelines state that a comment must contain a minimum of four lines. that is the only reason i am saying anything more about tomcats. because after all, my one line summary really says everything there is to say. there is absolutely nothing remotely entertaining in this film.

this movie, quite literally, does not have one redeeming feature. the characters are one-dimensional, cliched, incredibly misogynistic and stupid. the script looks as if it was cobbled together from 100 other movies, the acting is horrible, and some of the 'gross-out' humour made me feel nauseous.shame on you, gregory poirier, for thinking any of this would be funny or interesting!the worst movie i've seen in several years.

rare and auspicious are the moments in film-making when greatness stands as a defining monument for the rest of the industry to measure themselves against and for us to immerse in that glorious moment.some stories transcend their time and aspire to the lofty reaches of a classic and the stuff of legends. throw in the refined skills of an ensemble cast of thespians who are at the very top of their game."where has all the originality gone?" it is here, as this story and it's cast sashay through a plot and story that will not only educate but also entertain even the most seasoned of shakespearean/action/love story connoisseurs.i cannot begin to imagine where the writers dreamed up this extraordinary tale. where do geniuses get this kind of inspiration? i now have hope for mankind, knowing that this kind of talent still exists gives me hope that we will make it to the stars and beyond, perhaps to the very gates of heaven.i have, like others before me, dreamed of greatness. though i did not write this movie i did see it and because of this movie's noble greatness, i feel as if i have been elevated to a higher level of being, a higher level of spiritual wholeness.it is no wonder this kind of glory eludes most of us. what would become of our world if we all could attain this level of magnificence? we would probably be consumed in a white fire of super-nova glory as we evolve into trans-dimensional spiritual beings capable of omnipotent creative power.the most important thing to know, with all your heart and the very essence of your being, is that "tomcats" is nothing like what i have been talking about. "tomcats" is the antithesis of all i mentioned. it could very well destroy our world. for as some reviewers rate a movie on a star system, i.e. 1 through 5 stars, or even zero stars, i'm going to rate "tomcats" a black hole.i am willing to donate money to a cause that will put a stop to these kinds of atrocities that, as of late, seem to be running amuck at box offices. i'm not even adverse to the use of nuclear weapons. it must stop. how much more of this can we take before aliens from outer space come down here and blow up our planet because we have so many stupid, crass, vulgar, unimaginative, and degrading movies spewing out of hollywood? i'm not even going to dignify this movie by mentioning anyone's name that starred or produced it. i'm not even going to waste my time describing the story, since we've seen it a ba-zillion times, and all of the past versions were at least a ga-zillion times better.by the way my head nearly imploded during this movie, but with supreme selfless effort and lots-o-luck i survived to warn the public. you have been warned.

if you want to see someone accidentally eat another man's testicle, or look at a row of pathetically fake hard-ons at a wedding, or listen to a man talk about how good it felt to have sex with a girl while she was throwing up, then this is the movie for you. alternating, in neck breaking fashion, between romantic and gross out comedy, tomcats is certainly interesting. the lovely jaime pressly plays the wife of horatio sanz(tell me another one) who is found in many silhouetted situations with other women, but there is, surprisingly, no nudity. jake busey is thoroughly revolting as a hound dog who you wouldn't want as your friend. shannon elizabeth and jerry o'connell are both good and make a convincing couple, but the movie is far too busy trying to disgust to be any good.

here's the spoiler: at the end of the movie, a little piece of you dies. you'll spend the rest of your life searching in vain for that missing piece, but it's gone, it's gone. you'll wander the streets at night peering into your neighbors' windows as they sit down for dinner. friends and family will try to pinpoint when exactly you turned into the walking dead. you'll answer their questions and concerns with a blank stare and some mumblings about a runaway testicle. when amc inevitably makes tomcats the "movie of the month," a series of mysterious murders will take place in your city. you'll wake up the next morning balled up on the floor of the kitchen with a faint taste of brains in your mouth. then you'll crawl into the living room and onto the couch. you'll stare at the wall, wet yourself a little and then begin to laugh maniacally. because once your dead inside, jake busey in a thong is actually pretty damn funny.

don't see this movie! it's... repulsive! the start is indeed very good, but in the middle everything falls and i really regret spending 80 crowns (about 11 dollars) on the ticket! peter dalle should consider this as his last chance to gain peoples interest. awful picture! the only bright spot is the splendid work of robert gustavsson, lena nyman and gösta ekman.hope you take my advise... the picture is rubbish.

horrible, misogynist drivel. my neighbor brought this turkey over, subjected me to it, and didn't have the courtesy to apologize. the plot was laughable, my four year old could write a better movie.

this is movie is garbage, it looked really funny on the previews but i didn't laugh once through the whole movie. do yourself a big favor and don't waste your money on this, don't waste anyone's money on this. i gave it a 1/10 believe me i would have given it less if i could have. i'm a 15 year old guy and i thought it was trash if you wanna see a good movie go out and see jay and silent bob strike back.

right then. this film is totally unfunny, puerile, has gags from other films, has songs from other films (blink 182's "mutt", grand theft audio's "we luv u"), an unlikeable leading man, a ridiculous plot, and lame parodies of films like mission impossible 2 and american beauty. redeeming features? shannon elizabeth and jaime pressly. enough said.

highly flawed but just about watchable `comedy' that runs like a farrelly brothers reject. the most criminal thing about it though is the casting. i couldn't for one minute believe jerry o connell and jake busey in the role of superstuds, who could pull any woman at the drop of a hat, nor could i believe (the very beautiful) shannon elizabeth as a streetwise tough cop!. story is predictable but does manage to raise a titter on a few occasions, although, the `gross out', meant to be `shock comic' scenes, (one involving an amputated testicle, and another set in a sperm bank) are just plain awful. if this film is on tv then its probably worth watching if you are extremely bored, but please don't waste your money renting it!!

what can you say about a movie whose funniest episode sees a fat man wrestling a garden hose? the acting, particularly that of lead man jerry o'connel, is embarrassing. the dialogue is so contrived and unfunny it makes you cringe. the controlling idea is actually not a bad one for this genre (infantile teen comedy), but, somehow, the director manages to make the least of it. i rate it a 2 out of 10.

i mostly rented this movie to see shannon elizabeth. she played well in this movie, but the plot sucked. the movie wasn't really about anything just about trying to stay single after making a pact when one of jerry o' connell's friends gets married. the other friends put together this money and who's ever last to get married get's the money ($10,000) from all his friends. anyway the movie just try to follow through by making no since and trying to make it more funny then making since. i'm glad i only paid .50 for this movie. it really wasn't good at all. i rated it **** out of 10 stars!

i had expected a fairly straightforward r-rated graphic, sexual, crude teen-comedy when i sat down to see this... it turned out to be fairly accurate... only it was far more sick and disgusting than i would have thought. i don't know if the director/writer gregory poirier is sick or deeply messed up sexually, but i doubt that a normal person could have made a movie like this. i could probably have taken it if it was just that, if the only thing that was wrong was it was that it required a tough stomach... but it isn't. the film is also horribly mean-spirited and disturbing... every single character that has more than one full second of time on-screen is an extreme... sexually, mentally or physically. i don't know if this is just the director's sense of humor, but i just found it to be... wrong. just wrong. even in a comedy, there is supposed to be some seriousness. the plot is stupid. the acting is bad. the characters are inconsistent and poorly written... all of them. there isn't one single likable character in the film. the humor is disgusting and goes way too far. the film is just so incredibly poorly done that i really don't think it's worth anyone's time. if you like r-rated, crude comedies with plenty of sexual innuendo and graphic stuff, watch the groomsmen, or, better yet, american pie... or road trip, my personal favorite. but don't watch this. i can't possibly describe to you how bad it is... you would have to experience it for yourself. however, this is one of those times where i'll say that you're better off wondering. that way you can just imagine that this film goes very close to the bottom... without knowing that it goes through it, and far lower than that. this movie most of all looks like a group of horny teenage guys got together, put together a film crew, and every-time one of them got an idea, they filmed it, and later put the entire thing together. it lacks structure, consistency and taste. i recommend this only to horny teenage guys who have seen every single other r-rated crude teen comedy and who don't care about quality. everyone else... do the sensible thing; avoid this. it's not even worth it to see the booty. believe me. 1/10

** black dragons (1942) william nigh ~ bela lugosi, joan barclay, clayton moore "just prior to the start of world war ii, dr. melcher (bela lugosi), a world-famous surgeon, is brought in by japan's black dragon society as part of a secret plan. dr. melcher operates on six black dragon society operatives and transforms them into exact duplicates of 6 high ranking american businessmen who are replaced by these look-alikes. with their operatives in place, the black dragon society's plan to sabotage the american war effort appears to be set but, the f.b.i. chief and an agent begin to piece together the clues that hopefully uncover this sinister plot," according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis.that synopsis gives away the entire ending; which, in this case, might be a good thing. "black dragons" is an incredible, wildly inconsistent muddle. a wiser course of action would have been to stay with the teasing supernatural angle. in early scenes, mr. lugosi (as monsieur colomb) is effectively creepy. confusing joan barclay (as alice saunders), future "lone ranger" clayton moore (as dick martin), along with a cast of old stage and silent veterans do the best they can with a story that looks as if filmmakers were making it up as they went along.

when a group of businessmen start dying in the presence of the mysterious mr. coulomb, fbi agent dick martin is assigned to the case. as the deaths continue to mount, mr. martin obviously isn't having much success. by the end of the movie, the strange truth is revealed, which i won't reveal here.one of the other users commenting on this states "this is a classic film and should be enjoyed and not picked apart". i'm sorry but i have to respectfully disagree with this opinion. it is "classic" only in that it is old, not in any sense pertaining to its quality. i've enjoyed a lot of low budget "b" movies from around this time period, but this isn't one of them.the pacing is unbearably slow, the camera work is pretty bland, most of the acting is fairly wooden (even lugosi isn't great in this one in my opinion) and the plot, while it has an interesting premise, seems to be thrown together in a very difficult to follow manner.

first - nick-623, pearl harbor was bombed in 1941, not 1942. they didn't have to predict the bombing.second - did nobody notice these six industrialist/lawyers/whatever were missing for a rather long amount of time? they were killed *before* the surgery took place! third - how the heck did lugosi get out of cabs without being seen? fourth - why did the japanese not just kill him, instead of putting him in jail with a convenient look-alike companion and his surgical kit? fifth - oh, what's the use? this movie has a few interesting moments in it, but by the time they explain what's going on, you'll probably have stopped watching. if not, you won't care.

if i could give this movie a negative rating i would. the humor is the cruelest i have ever seen in a film. horrible things happen to good people and people who have already suffered horribly through no fault of their own. there are 2 plots, neither of which supports half of a film. where is the "depth" others see in this movie? that no good deed goes unpunished? that only the heartless can succeed? the film does start well and the black and white is very moody and well done. the acting is very good and convincing witch makes the cruel humor even more horrifying. if you think that the 3 stooges are too nice to each other, if watching the beheading of a kidnap victim with a bowie knife is a real thigh slapper, if you thought "schindler's list" was hilarious, then this movie is for you.

bela lugosi is a real enigma. in the early 1930s, he was on top of the world after appearing in dracula. yet, again and again, he made lousy decisions regarding his career. perhaps he had a bad agent, perhaps his drinking and drug use had a part in it or maybe he was just crazy. regardless, he ruined his reputation by appearing in pretty much any film--ranging from excellent horror films (such as the raven) to big-budget flicks (like ninotchka) to grade-z flicks for the cheapest and shoddiest of studios. interestingly enough, although he agreed to do this terrible film, he actually turned down the role that later went to boris karloff in frankenstein! as for this movie, it is a very silly an horridly produced wwii propaganda film that featured a dumb plot and wretched editing. lugosi spends much of the movie murdering saboteurs--not a bad thing at all. but at the end, we find out that he is himself a nazi plastic surgeon and all the american-looking men he killed were actually japanese!!!! the funniest part of this is during a flashback. you see lugosi talking to a group of japanese men before he changes them to american-like men. when the camera scans them, the men are clearly asian. but, on all the other non-close-up shots, they are all very western looking--many with bald heads!! they looked absolutely nothing like japanese men. i suspect the plot must have undergone a re-write and this might account for the obvious mistake. or, it could just be shoddy production values and editing. in fact, early in the film, they show a street scene in the city and all the cars (circa 1942) are old model t fords--obviously from stock footage!!! the bottom line is that the film is bad but also very dull. unlike plan 9 from outer space, it's hard to laugh at the ineptitude--just be put to sleep by it.

set in 1945, skenbart follows a failed swedish book editor who decides to take a non-stop train to berlin. unfortunately for everyone around him, he's a walking disaster, causing mayhem everywhere he goes. the train also holds a man and his mistress scheming to murder the man's wife (who's also on the train), a soldier on his way home, two gay elderly gentlemen, an angry train conductor, two nuns, a bunch of refugees, and even more people.meant as a mix of noir-ish thriller (which it does quite well - at least to begin with), and comedy, the film fails with both. it doesn't sit right as the film changes tone with every new scene. and as the train races towards its final destination, the film turns more and more bizarre, ending on a truly surreal note.the good bits are wasted in a myriad of pointless plots and characters. skenbart is packed with famous swedish actors, no matter how small the part is. it feels like the filmmakers rang everyone they've ever worked with and offered them a part in the film. too bad that the performances are just as bad as the script (act your lines - don't read them!).the comedy is more or less slapstick, with the same jokes repeated over and over. the pace is incredibly slow at times (quite often, actually) with on scene in particular dragging on for about ten minutes for no good reason. the screenwriter also seems to think that swearing is a good way to replace decent dialogue. the film looks great though, in moody b&w, but it's wasted on such inept film-making in every other department. [1/10]

outside sweden you are not expected have seen this movie. happy you. the cast includes several actors that are important part of modern the swedish movie history. and still.. seems like peter dalle only had a an idea lasting for about 20 minutes. robert gustafson is totally misused in this movie, trying to copy a younger gösta ekman. ekman, by the way, is the only actor fulfilling the expectations. credit that can be given is for the photo, splendid idea using black and white. music is ok.but over-all it's a waste of god actors and the time of the audience.

i had this movie given to me, and have to admit, i am glad that i did not pay money for it.the back of the box makes it seem like some kind of sex triangle, with 2 women trying to seduce her. but the reality in this movie is far from that.in reality, the main subject is the victim of a vicious and sadistic rape by the two other characters. there was absolutely nothing in this that i found interesting at all.even movies like silence of the lambs and wild things (which the box tries to compare this movie to) were riveting, because of the unexpected turns and suspense.but jaded has none of this. it concentrates on the rapeists and the sick relationship with the boyfriend of one of them. and the persuit of a videotape that may prove the victims story is true.while it does show that same sex rape is possible, it is not a movie worth watching.if at all possible, pass this movie up at all costs.

"jaded" offers a premise with potential as it looks at the rape of a woman by two other women and ask the question "when is rape not rape?". unfortunately the flick seems to suffer from bad direction as it slogs through legal minutia while trying to weave some kind of story with a handful of foul mouthed and poorly portrayed characters only to end abruptly. "jaded" is lame stuff only for the bleary-eyed couch potato in the mood for some dark drama.

hard to imagine what they were thinking of when they made this movie (i.e., the writers, directors, producers, actors, editors, etc.). christopher plummer, veteran of 129 movies, frolics along among scores of other actors with apparently no more motivation than to collect a paycheck. i guess there is nothing wrong with that, but once they are paid that doesn't mean anyone has to watch it.it bugs me that there are actually good reviews for this movie here at imdb. art? if you want to see art go to an art gallery, don't watch this movie. comedy? watch a re-run of the flintstones, about the same plot with less time wasted.dabney coleman gives his usual performance, for better or worse. and some of the young actors may have gotten some good experience from doing this movie. but plummer???? it was embarrassing to watch his performance, in fact i was positively transfixed on him throughout the movie, knowing this was plummer of sound of music fame! i see from his bio that he called sound of music "sound of mucus", so guess he didn't like it as much as the 100's of millions who liked him in it.i wonder if today he was asked, how do you rate sound of music compared to where the heart is, what would he say.....?probably something like "where the money is"....

i'm a boorman fan, but this is arguably his least successful film. comedy has never been his strong suit, and here his attempts at screwball farce are clumsily done. still, it's almost worth seeing for boorman's eye for talent: this is one of uma thurman's first starring roles, and as always she is ravishing to watch. (on a sad side note, boorman wrote the script with his daughter, telsche, who died a couple years ago.)

i say this. if you want to see art, you go to an art gallery. if you want to see a movie, you go to a theater. trying to intertwine art and film proves disastrous in "where the heart is". an interesting cast is totally wasted in this embarrassment. you like dabney coleman, see "short time". you like crispin glover, see "bartleby". you like uma thurman, see "kill bill". above all, if you like christopher plummer, see "the silent partner", because his character here, is a terrible embarrassment. in fact this entire production is an embarrassment. sure the human artwork is intriguing for a few minutes, so make a short, but do not subject an audience to pointless nonsense, masquerading as filmed entertainment. - merk

after seeing this piece of crap you will know why the limeys drive on the left side of the street...this movie is an absolute no-brainer! the jokes (if this is the right word for it...) are mostly sub-standard (about 98%) and do miss any punch-line at all. save the money and get drunk. you might enjoy this movie being totally wasted, perhaps!

it really is terrible, from start to finish you'll sit and watch this ridiculous idiot, thinking hes cool when he's really not, rubbish plot line, terrible acting and complete waste of time and money, do not bother.

i like ali g's show, i believe the guy has comedic instinct, but hasn't (yet) developed it to a talent.the movie is a little worse than i was expecting. i don't find ali-g offensive, just stupid. jokes for 5-year olds, some good, some terrible.if you want to watch a movie that seems "offensive", but is actually funny, see tom green's 'freddy got fingered'.2/10

i had already heard of ali g in madonna's music video "music". i always think he's funny. (in fact, he really is.) just last year i always thought of buying a vcd of "ali g indahouse". that's why some months later, i bought it cheap and i started watching it.but the movie surprised me. my older brother and i were expecting it to be a great laugh-out comedy. it turns out that "indahouse" is just a stupid piece of garbage. it was really really bad. it also contains explicit sexuality content and very crude humor. it also didn't made me laugh, even just a big smile. we definitely hate that movie. oh by the way, i have plans to sell it.ali g was really different in his movie compared to his tv shows-- in such a negative way. maybe he wasn't really well-focused and enough serious to make this flick. just because there's some sex scenes in it doesn't mean it's freaking hilarious (because sometimes, too much isn't that laughable anymore). for the first time ever, i was disappointed at him. that really made me sad rather and happy.i gave this movie 1 over 10. actually, i really want to give it a 0 rating. it's one of the worst movies i've seen in my entire life. i wouldn't recommend to anyone who wanna watch good comedies that aren't too explicit or horrible.

don't tell me this film was funny or a little funny. it was a complete disaster, and one of the worst movies i've ever seen. ali g is only funny on channel 4's ali g show. after watching his performance, all i can say is he is not made for movies. with a daft script, or more like no storyline, there's nothing to keep you entertained. full of annoying, unrealistic character's this movie is a complete garbage all the way. at the end of the film, ali g gives a speech. he mentions, if you hated this film, tell people it was good. not even the speech could save the movie, he probably knew its gonna be a stinker. i would of given this a 0/10, but the minimum start is 1. overall, don't even waste your time on this rubbish.

bean, kevin & perry, uk tv creations that have made successful transitions onto the big screen. now its ali g's turn and i m afraid to say this is not one of them!ali has always been obscene but funny with it. this film was extremley sick and not funny at all. scenes involving bestiality, gay sex and paedophilia should not be portrayed for entertainment's sake.ali g in da house is rubbish and deserves making very little money.1 out 10

if i compare two films with sacha cohen, borat and ali g then ali g is immeasurably better. i'ts no master piece, but it's a film at least. borat is complete garbage and i do not understand how it rated better then ali g.i cannot put my finger on it, there something wrong with the ali g script: half of the jokes are as if written by a 15 years old, not by an adult scriptwriter. and a number of jokes including mr cohen's lower body are quite tasteless. but the film actually comes together as a comedy and there are some valid jokes too that are funny: such as how ali g becomes a member of government for doing something scandalous and stupid in the public (sadly true in today's western society: people get careers for doing stupid things in public), also ali's advice about immigrant policy and some others. ali g overall remains a sympathetic character, even though a kind of mentally underdeveloped for his age. but it's ok to watch,it's quite funny.but never ever watch borat, it's awful and makes every intelligent movielover sick.

my god how bad this is. who is this impostor pretending to be ali g? avoid this at all costs. it replaces the smart multi-layered satire and humour of his show with down and out toilet humour.this was obviously an attempt to get him known in the states before he released his show there on hbo.one commentator here pleads that we not judge the movie on the merits of the show due to the difference in the mediums. while it is true that the standard format of the show could never have been transferred to the big screen mr sacha baron cohen could have ensured the smart use of his comic style in a more conventional movie storyline. instead we have this mess, which in all honesty has nothing at all to do with ali g except for the packaging.terribly disappointing. go seek out the dvd's of innit, aiiii, or bling bling for some real ali g.

ali g was funny at first. his interviews were fresh and original. the idea of a mock gangster wearing ott clothes and using street wise lingo was appealing at first.but this film is just a rehash of old jokes, the humour was mainly childish and revolved around the male sex organ for the most part. the film claimed good actors like charles dance, but their talents were wasted as they played silly 2-d characters. it is not 'terrible' but isn't really funny at all a second time. it could be said that the movie was ali g's last bastion of comedy. after that he ran out of steam.

i have absolutely no idea why i watched ali g indahouse except for the fact that salon seemed to think a crime was committed by not nominating sacha baron cohen for a emmy for his work on da ali g show. it is a sure bet that i will never watch that show as there was absolutely nothing funny about the movie. comedy? torture was more like it. it was just about the stupidest thing i every watched. i will admit that i was captivated by rhona mitra. i had not seen her in anything. she wasn't on the practice during the time i was watching, so i guess i will have to check out boston legal one of these evenings to see how she does in something that may be worth watching.

may contain spoilers for about the last four years i've been a keen fan of ali g. sacha baron cohen is undoubtedly a very funny and intelligent guy and, in my view, his best creation is borat who's as funny as hell and quite shameless in what he does and says to people.anyway, to the movie. i didn't bother paying money to see this in the cinema; i suppose because i didn't expect a lot but when i hired the dvd recently, i found the whole thing pretty sad. the best part of ali's taking the mickey out of others was largely missing and the script an plot was pretty damned awful; hooking all the car batteries together to blow a safe - really!!?? this movie goes to show i think that some things can run for too long and definitely don't translate to the big screen. the movie also had that syrupy sweet ending that i've come to expect from british films. where have all the good british movie making ideals gone to? that said, there were the odd very funny moments such as the dog in ali's bed and ali's audience with hm the q with the "shaven haven - respect" remark.so, in summary, i am an ali g and borat fan and i have enjoyed many of his interviews (notably the one with anita roddick of the body shop) but this movie fell really flat with me. if there's to be another movie, i hope it's a whole lot better than this lot of old tripe.weasel100 canberra, australia

pretty lousy made-for-tv sequel to the roman polanski classic. rosemary's son adrian has grown up and is embodied by creepy stephen mchattie. after eliminating rosemary (here played by patty duke) a coven of witches, again led by minnie & roman castevets, preps satan's son for world domination. it's not really scary and light years less macabre than its predecessor. instead, writer anthony wilson and director sam o'steen opt for a satan-worshiping thriller full of a lot of chanting, plenty of candles, and ruth gordon trying to act daffy and nasty at the same time. gordon's the sole holdover from the original. george maharis replaces john cassavetes as guy and a very hammy ray milland plays roman castevets, subbing for the late sidney blackmer. newcomer mchattie is the film's only real saving grace. he's very off-kilter and looks really sinister without even doing anything. the music by charles bernstein is suitably creepy, but so over-used, it's ends up being intrusive rather than effective. o'steen, who edited the earlier polanski masterpiece, shows no flair or subtlety whatsoever.

with its few touches of surrealism, lwhtrb works as low-grade horror, but as a major follow-up statement to the original, it flounders miserably. things begin somewhat promising during the telefilm's opening credits... we see and hear several interesting shots and sounds: the baby's black crib with the overhanging, inverted cross; the kitchen knife rosemary carried into the castevette's apartment and dropped in shock (the utensil is shown sticking out of the hardwood floor); and the emptiness of the bramford itself, without tenants or furniture (voice-overs can be heard here from the previous film's dialog). interesting too is the easter egg hunt the titular child participates in (the eggs and baskets are also black). once the story gets rolling, it never really 'rolls'... and what happens to rosemary when she boards that driverless bus, and is whisked away to god-knows-where? patty duke (a poor replacement for mia farrow), ray milland and tina louise (as the southwestern whore who raises the child, "adrian/andrew") head this almost-star cast, with ruth gordon reprising her "minnie" role.although not a total failure, this sequel-of-sorts should have been released in book form first, then maybe we all could have been a bit better informed... and not left totally in the dark. a fairly recent sequel novel "son of rosemary" (1999?) is the legitimate followup by ira levin himself.

sam o'steen, the film editor on the superlative suspense flick "rosemary's baby" from 1968, here directs a quickie tv-made sequel, one in which rosemary woodhouse (patty duke astin, in for mia farrow) is shunted off early--and inexplicably--presumably to help flesh out the more ghoulish aspects of this flaccid story about satan's son on earth. most interesting is the return of ruth gordon to her oscar-winning role as minnie castevet (with ray milland well-cast as her husband, roman), but she isn't given much to do--and looks terribly uncomfortable at being involved anyway. this script is strictly low-rent goods, and must have shamed original author ira levin (who went on to write his own sequel). fairly dim and pallid, with poor photography and no suspense or scares whatsoever.

i usually seek to find good in movies, even the bad ones.unfortunately this movie is one where i fail miserably-and the fact that there's barely one positive review on this board shows many imdb reviewers share my pain.i don't usually watch sequels but i just had to see this since i love "rosemary's baby" so much. what a mistake that was. it simply reaffirms my belief in the fact that most sequels are lousy-though thankfully, very few are as bad as this. in fact in my mind this isn't even really a sequel, it's a satire on how bad a sequel can be. movie recommended very highly for not viewing-at any time-ever.

for a movie that gained so much recognition and appraise this spinoff to "rosemarys baby" is one big mistake. it starts off that andrew/adrian whatever his name is because he's so confused that he doesn't know who he is anymore runs away from a cult with his mother and soon is kidnapped by a strange lady that ends up taking care of him as if she were his mother. the acting is terrible as andrew grows up in his twenties and looks terrible with his sunken in face, never ending grin and dukes of hazard clothes on looks more like a drunken has been than the son of satan. in fact thats all he does is drink and falls sloppily all over himself as he tries to come to grips with his past and the last memory of his mother driving away on a bus screaming to him. he finds a friend that seems to be an angel but he's quickly killed off and electricuted in a hillarious scene in which he looks more like a christmas tree. andrew gets cought and the cult with the members of the first part test him to see if he's really the son of satan. his dumb self fails the test and gets up off the alter glittering with myme makeup and jumps of the stage of a night club and dances like a clown on crack!!! this scene is memorable and well worth a watch. the ending is terrible and somewhat predictable considering how stupid he is in the whole movie. do not watch this piece of trash or you will loose respect for the first part.

this film is a bad film but to gain any nutritional value from it i recommend watching it back to back with rosemary's baby.there is a lot to learn seeing how different directors can draw different performances from the same actors playing the same characters. observe minnie castevet (ruth gordon) and the fine work she did in the first film vs the awful rendition in this film.it is also interesting to see how the same characters were played by different actors. which leads me to wonder if anyone involved with the sequel were aware of the first film and did any of them watch rosemary's baby before making this?if your interest in films is purely superficial then you would best avoid this one. i have a lot more to say about this film but i really don't want to go there.

i was hoping that pulp would be a interesting movie, but was profoundly disappointed.pulp has very little storyline, and what there is never holds your interest. it was a real struggle to keep watching it. when its over you say to you self "huh? that's it?!?". this is one where you think after watching it - why did they ever bother?its too bad since michael caine is a good actor. i was also hoping to see the great lizabeth scott in this, but she only appears on screen for a total of perhaps one minute. scott is one of the all time great film noir femme fatale girls and this was her last film.oh well...

this is a silly spoof of private eye thrillers as a novelist(michael cain)is called upon to 'ghostwrite' an autobiography of a colorful, waning hollywood star(mickey rooney). at times silliness becomes obnoxious. this is not cain at his best. rooney is way over the top. notable support from lizabeth scott, lionel stander and the comely nadia cassini. not easy to watch.

sometimes when a film is panned by the critics one just has to see it to see if it is really as bad as the claim, well in this case it was. i believe it was meant to be a sex comedy but it was neither sexy nor funny, i think i chuckled once when johnny vegas failed to vault a roadside fence and that was it.the film follows the lives of four men who deliver potatoes for a living, each of them has a problem with their sex lives; dave has left his wife and seeks out an old flame who once invited him for a threesome a few years before, ferris is living with his mother in law who treats him as a sex object, tolly has an obsession for involving strawberry jam in his encounters and jeremy claims to be in a loving relationship but is in fact stalking some poor woman.the tone of the jokes varies from tasteless to "i don't believe that anybody could write that" an example of the the latter being when they tell a small child his father has died in a car crash, then for the punch line when the boy asks how his mum is they tell him she is in a coma. the blame for this all lands squarely at the feet of the writers, the actors obviously made a poor choice agreeing to be in this film but i didn't think their acting was all that bad... not that it was all that good either. surprisingly for a fairly sleazy film about sex there is no nudity and the sex is never erotic.i certainly wouldn't recommend seeing this for any reason other than morbid curiosity although judging from other reviews this seems to be a love it or loathe it film, i suspect it would be better watched after a few beers and with your mates.

there are no spoilers for this film as nothing could be written that could make it any worse! the dictionary definition of "puerile" should now read: "sex lives of the potato men"! unless, that is, you like dog poo and mucous; in which case - this is the film to see! johnny vegas et all - what were you thinking!

the daily mail's christopher tookey had some choice things to say about this film, among them "watch it all the way through its 82 miserable minutes, and i guarantee you'll be shaking your head and asking: 'have we really descended to this?' yes, we have, for if ever a movie testified to the utter cynicism, tastelessness and moral corruption of those who commission and make british movies, it is this abomination". tookey continues "aimed squarely at oafs with unwashed underwear, filthy minds and knuckles that graze the pavement when they walk, this sex comedy is so sordid, unfunny and malodorous that it is enough to put you off sex, and indeed films, for life", before concluding "sex lives of the potato men is not merely a truly vile film, it is symptomatic of a new national culture of instant self-gratification, yobbishness and sadism that is now being celebrated on screen". normally i don't listen too closely to the critics, but in this case, tookey was bang on the money. this film goes beyond bad, indeed, it goes beyond being merely unfunny and enters some bizarre parallel universe where every painful minute drags on for an hour and where the definition of 'hilarious' seems to be 'saying tw*t in a brummie accent'. it's depressing to anyone with half a brain who grew up with the goodies, monty python, spitting image, not the nine o'clock news and fawlty towers.ideally, sex lives of the potato men would have quietly vanished after its cinema release and joined the equally dire vix spin-off the fat slags (2004) and the ill-starred all saints vehicle honest (2000) in the celluloid graveyard, but as it seems destined for endless late night schedule-filling screenings and misguided "best film ever!" raves from people who should know better, so i must apologise in advance for trying to right a wrong that the british film industry, in all its wisdom, has inflicted onto an undeserving world. yes, i really am sorry to bring this one back from the celluloid dead, but i actually remember thinking "it can't be as bad as the critics said it was"...but, as god is my witness, it was worse.acting - dire from start to finish, special mention to mackenzie 'albert steptoe's legs on a young man's body' crook.soundtrack - cut and paste 'ladrock', mostly ska-based lager-lout-friendly pub jukebox piffle which brought back horrible memories of seeing those chirpy cockernee doin' the lambeth walk to a watered-down imitation of the specials knob-shiners madness on every single comedy / variety programme in the eighties...and 'ace of spades' by motorhead as the title music? what the hell...trying to evoke memories of one of the most genuinely exciting scenes ever offered by the young ones, indeed, ever offered by any comedy show?! cheap shot, way below the belt.script - written by a 12 year old who's just read every single back issue of smut and zit in one long red bull-fuelled session...surely? c'mon, no real, proper, worldly, grown-up person could possibly set this kind of retarded hogwash on paper? and mark gatiss was in it...mark gatiss...the least annoying member of the league of gentlemen and goodies fan taking part in such a towering heap of fly-blown cinematic excrement? 'one of the brightest british comedy stars'? not any more he's not! on the subject of league of gentlemen, somebody give me a pair of lead-lined diver's boots and steve 'face like a collapsed rectum' pemberton and a long weekend in a soundproofed room before i die...please...cinema, british or otherwise, just doesn't come much worse than this. kent bateman's the headless eyes (1971) is a new-wave masterpiece compared to this repugnant smut.

i found myself watching sex lives of the potato men with a furrowed brow, puzzled why so many talented and witty comedians decided to be involved in a film so totally devoid of humour.poo and wanking jokes are funny when you're eleven. eighteen plus and you begin to lose friends around the water cooler.maybe some enjoyment could be had from this movie if you're the kind of person who frequently plays practical jokes involving dog mess, brown bags and matches, or maybe partake in 'man' competitions on nights-out by imbibing companions' vomit/urine etc when you're not back at your parent's basement punching your teenage wife.even then "sex lives..." it's hard to recommend. perhaps if you're really weirdly into masochistic cranial surgery and spend your evenings happy slapping the elderly or watching toilets flush, you might think a close-up of a bogie is worthy of cinematic distribution.i'd discuss characterisation, narrative or performances had i not zoned completely out following the lengthy tuna-paste/vagina comparison.

i watched this film with a sort of dangerous fascination, like a hedgehog trapped in the headlights. there is no doubt that (even if you enjoyed it) it's a bad movie, but the important question is why? it has a good cast; it's lively; it's prepared to tackle sex head on, with some of the characters actually getting some of it here and there, which is unusual for a british comedy. it also has johnny vegas and mackenzie crook, marmite performers agreed but they've have had their moments in the past.what it's principally lacking is charm. the characters are impossibly idiotic, unbelievable and alienating, so that instead of a film of men behaving badly the producers have made game on. any mediocre writer wanting to make a film about the sexual attitudes of dozy, sexist british men would have got hold of a few copies of loaded, zoo or even viz to read sid the sexist and the thing would have written itself. instead, the producers clearly tried to make up some moronic, difficult to care about, characters. character comedy - as opposed to slapstick etc - only works if the audience can recognise some human truth to the situation. but watching this film is like being told an annoying joke that you know is not going to end up funny but you can't stop it.sadly, the film is also poorly made. the plot structure is weak, there's little character delineation or development, and many of the scenes aren't funny. time after time the same lame reggae chips in to divide scenes, pointlessly and gratingly. there's a lot of needless repetition - when you've done one joke about parking outside a sex party you don't need to do it again. one wonders what the uk film council saw in the script.this is a world where most men are rakes, and most women are continually up for it. the apartment and alfie satirised much the same world view, but the producers of this film accept it without criticism. thus they've ended up with a kind of inferior update of confessions of a window cleaner. somebody british needs to have another go at this kind of thing, and do it properly  a good next project for simon pegg and edgar wright i think...

ever watched something so awful you just have to keep watching to be sure it really is as bad as it looks? this is one of those films. it was slammed by the critics on it's release, not least for the way it was funded. i caught it on tv last night and gave in to curiosity.in the event, it is what it says on the box, no more nor less: low level humour, crudity, very much in the 'carry on...' vein but with 'adult' language. indeed, it harks back to the 60s/70s uk porn industry, cheating punters by promising real sex and not delivering (spot the nipple?) that whole tawdry era is lovingly recreated here but with modern cinematography.it has the benefit of mackenzie crook (the office, pirates of the caribbean and much more) and also johnny vegas. the chip shop girl is genuinely sexy. beyond these unexpected positives, it does leave me wondering what happened to england. junk food, low paid work, council estates, desperate lives. as a bonus, there are some nice shots of leafy birmingham. foreigners might find it informative about british attitudes and aspirations. overall, though, i still feel disbelief that i sat through it.

sex lives of the potato men is about the sex lives of several men involved in delivering potatoes. so there are no surprises there. it is, in fact, pretty much what you might expect from the title: that is, it's a quirky comedy involving sex and potato men. at times the film works. it's an edgy, sometimes uncomfortable comedy about the lives of some rather unimportant and rather average men who are having problems of various sorts with women. where the film clearly does not work, and why it failed at the box office, is that the quirky, uncomfortable parts are perhaps just a shade too quirky and uncomfortable. instead of laughing during the scene of a man suspended from a basement ceiling masturbating over another man while he makes love to his wife, i think most of us just kind of groan awkwardly and wonder what andy humphries was thinking. well, perhaps we are shown what he was thinking all too clearly.

this film with fine production values features secrets and how friends use each other. henry may long is a very well-acted, dimly lit, depressing turn-of-the-century period piece about a friendship between a fatally ill man and a melancholy, indebted junkie. talky drawing room dramas are not my cup of tea, and all the crying wears thin. recommended if you like independent, slyly intellectual, slow-paced merchant ivory-type features. i suspected that the main characters were in love, but their connection was so intimated, it didn't really have the emotional impact of 'brokeback mountain.' it features some good writing with a scene discussing how to disappear in life, but it is truly a dark and depressing film.

oh my god i am lost now i know everything this guy does is pointless r j a wrote at august 13th, 2006 (posting no. 881): what an awful experience. it looked like a bunch of 3rd graders stole a video camera, borrowed some old editing software from 1995, and played a joke on each other. trash rgc wrote at august 1st, 2006 (posting no. 747): this movie is a piece of @$#@#@. it sucks calling this a movie would be misleading. this was a group of friends having a good time and videotaping one another. the storyline was very hard to follow. the attempted artistic camera angles detracted from the story and in to themselves made the entire time a dizzying experience. the acting although comical was very amateurish. the concept is ok, i guess. perhaps next time, the producers should raise some capital and hire actual professionals and try again. i must say that i'm sick and tired of so many thinking that making a good movie is easy. it is not easy... this fact seems to be lost or ignored by many that believe that without any training/experience and talent that they can make a good product. i guess in the end they will learn just how difficult it is i am so disgusted i have no comment chrisite wrote at august 5th, 2006 (posting no. 762):

ok, so this is horror? i get horror - but i don't get horrific. black & white is artistic but too much black is overkill.....enough said about the lighting. the story - a serial killer ....... lot's of these around. it's been done in the past and yes, it will continue to be done.....but i hope not. my question is , when will the audience tire of reliving this maddening dilemma? i guess the director thought he would do something different - portray killing children. well that's been done before too. so i guess he had to go to shock value.....have them killed in the darkest of fashions. okay ..... the audience was shocked......sickened....disgusted.....numbed. and getting up out of my seat , i felt all of these things. so was the director successful? yes! absolutely! these are the things he wanted me to feel and i did. now what do i do with the feelings? and more importantly, what is the "message" here? with the amazing talent that francis xavier was "gifted" with.....could he ever consider applying it to making films that speak of, dare i say, coming out of the darkness? i was left in the dark after viewing this film, my soul was assaulted....is that what this craft is about? there are many such films out there - they make the bucks i'm told. so what's up with the people that want to see all these deploring visuals? what is going on in this world that people will pay to be horrifically shocked? would i see this again.....not ever.

early talkie feature based on a popular stage play. a murder has been committed and a bunch of people hire a medium to conduct a séance to see who the murderer is. while the lights are out there's another murder...so it's someone in that room.what follows is an obvious, dull and creaky murder mystery. most of the cast overacts to a ridiculous degree. they act like they're on stage (where you have to overdo things) and it looks silly on screen. most embarrassing is bela lugosi (two years before "dracula") who really overdoes it as a police inspector. static direction by tod browning (who was always overrated) doesn't help.for browning and lugosi completists only. i give it a 3.

some years back, this film had been scheduled for broadcast on tcm uk as part of a tod browning retrospective  but what they actually showed was the 1937 remake!; my brother had watched it (and, in hindsight, it followed the original pretty much scene-for-scene, even down to the set design)  though no classic, he said it was a far more satisfying viewing experience than the incredibly creaky earlier version this being the first collaboration between browning and bela lugosi, i had high hopes for it  but these were quashed when it became evident after the first reel of tedious conversation that the film's main concern was to appease the still-novel sound technique, and consequently the result is stagey and extremely static. the thriller plot isn't exactly exciting either; even less appetizing is the ostensible british-indian setting (with the characters' affected accents and upper-class demeanor  not to mention the over-use of corny idiosyncratic idioms such as "i say", "rather" and "now look here"  rendering the whole risible more than anything else)! apart from this, there are a few unintended howlers: margaret wycherly (as a fake medium) pleads with police inspector lugosi (if anything, his undeniable screen presence is already evident) to give her some time to 'work out' who the culprit of the double-murder really is (the evidence points to her own daughter, played by leila hyams!)  she hears a tapping and is deluded into thinking that the spirit world has genuinely made contact with herbut then lugosi enters the room and, in his unmistakable accent, straight-facedly tells her "i knocked twice  you didn't hear me!", at which my brother and i almost fell to the floor in convulsions of laughter!!; the editing is really sloppy, too: during one high-angle shot of the main set, a mike is seen being rapidly pulled up out of camera range  and even worse are a couple of instances where a person walks off-screen, ostensibly into the next shot, to another part of the setbut each shot is held on the other actors for an absurdly long time, so that it appears to take forever for this person to walk just a few paces!! the thirteenth chair marks the third non-horror browning talkie that i've watched  even if both this and miracles for sale (1939) deal with murder and occultism and could, therefore, still be linked to the genre. much has been said about the director's apparent slackening with the coming of sound: however, flawed though they may be, the 4 straight horror films he did throughout the 30s are infinitely better than the rest  which i've always found stylish and bizarre enough to suggest that browning wasn't as much at sea during this period as has been suggested

**spoilers** i rented "tesis" (or "thesis" in english) on the strength of director alejandro amenabar's later effort "the others". based on what a brilliantly measured and horrifyingly effective creepfest that film was, i assumed his earlier efforts would be of a similar quality and i was in the mood for some good horror. instead i wound up with the most tedious, preposterous excuse for a lame-brained slasher movie i've seen since the german film "anatomie" (which this one kinda reminded me of).the plot has potential but it's thrown away within the first 20 minutes. it revolves around innocent-n-pretty psychology student angela's (ana torrent - a jessica harper deadringer) thesis on the subject of violence in films. through some far-fetched circumstances too dumb to go into here, she winds up in possession of a 'snuff' tape on which two men torture, mutilate and kill a young girl for the camera. angela, and her horror-buff friend chema (fele martinez) are both shocked yet intrigued by the tape and decide to get to the bottom of who's responsible for it.this leads to... well, nothing.they never really give a reason for why they want to find the girl's killers (since they resolutely refuse to contact the police throughout any of the unfolding events, even when their own lives at risk) and the mystery itself is as limp as graham norton in a room full of bunny girls. there is only one proper 'clue' (the type of camera the killers used is discovered) and that's a) a really weak one and b) wheeled out in the first 20 minutes. the rest of the so-called 'unravelling' just occurs through blind luck, increasingly ridiculous plot twists and a slew of awful, transparent and thoroughly pointless red herrings that are chucked in merely to pad out the running time.seriously - amenabar might know his stuff about ghost stories but he's clearly never read a detective book in his life. the key to a good whodunnit is to have a large cluster of potential suspects and to eliminate them one by one with clever deduction and the gradual discovery of more and more evidence, before moving in for the final twist. in "tesis", *potential spoiler ahead* the killer's identity is guessed correctly by the amateur 'detectives' almost instantly and then we get 100 minutes of the writer trying feebly to throw us off the scent until he runs out of ideas, throws his hands up and says "ok, ya got me, it was him after all"! as for any kind of logic or motive behind the crimes - no such luck. you're watching the wrong movie if that's what you're after.the only thing that drags "tesis" down further from just being a dumb, badly written thriller is the way it actually tries to make some ludicrous, muddled-up 'point' about violence in films. i have no idea what stance it's attempting to take on the subject but it seems determined to cram in a ton of misguided, confused psychobabble, in between the rest of the gibberish, and say "look at me! i'm political!". the final scenes, in which the "point" of the movie is supposedly hammered home, are so utterly absurd and puerile, one can't help but wonder if amenabar feels embarrassed now when he watches this. if he doesn't, he certainly should. this is total 'amateur night at the slasher house' stuff.overall i can't believe i wasted two whole hours (it felt like at least six) on this, just hoping something might happen. the urban legend of 'snuff films' (and that is basically all they are, despite the way this film tries to suggest they're some kind of criminal phenomenon sweeping the world!) is an area that can be so tantalisingly exploited in good horror films ("videodrome" anyone?) but it's so easy to step over the line into childlike 'wouldn't it be cool if!' territory with it (ie: "my little eye")... "tesis" hits an all-time low for the 'snuff movie' genre. on every level, this one is better left dead and buried. i'll award it a 1 out of 10, for some nice lighting, but that's all it's getting.

great acting, great production values, good direction.but the script starts out with great pacing and interest in the first half and then falls apart in the second half. we're clear on character and motivation for the first half but then the second half leaves many questions unanswered.the conflicts raised are compelling but the follow-through is weak. for instance, we're very clear that rudyard kipling is pro-war but we don't know if that philosophical stance changes through the course of the film.this is the sort of picture that makes me want to look up the facts in history books. i don't feel i can rely on the film to get a clear idea.the depiction of the war itself is heart-breakingly accurate, though the women's lack of enthusiasm doesn't reflect the war hysteria that swept britain at the time. perhaps this is historically accurate; like so much in this film, i simply don't know.

this has got to be the worst show i have ever seen. i always liked chuck norris in films, but why do we need to make these shows politically correct by adding a black side kick who is as threatening as shirley temple in little miss marker. i also thought the show was limited because how many times can you kick a guy in the face and make it interesting. i know an african american who looks like this trivette guy and he gets his butt kicked about once a week he is all attitude.chuck norris is the man and he deserves all the kudos he gets, i think this show started great but lost steam as time went onthey should have dumped chucks side kick

i'd never thought that i would be caught saying this: but i think "dog the bounty hunter" is more entertaining than this 90's era cop drama. walker is very melodramatic and actually set a standard of the genre of "high octane" cop shows such as csi, csi: miami, and so forth. i'm not saying all these shows are bad, but they aren't good either. i like the karate chop action that walker dispenses on the enemies of justice, and the diverse cast of characters as much as the science tech of the csi series. but there are some elements that i hate in a show like this. stereotypes/countertypes! that's right, stereotypes/countertypes! unfortunately, this is a show for the moderates of red state america who refuse to part with the old prejudices of yore especially when it comes to crime. for example, there was an episode in which a kid with psychic powers ventures into dallas where he encounters group of kids in goth/punk clothing and they start harassing him. now! this is exactly what middle america perceives the goth/punk culture. i mean come on, how often do people that dress like that rob and steal from people just minding there own business. whenever there are blacks and latinos in the plot it's always about gangs in some impoverished neighborhood. okay! not everyone who's a minority is a desperate recruit of a gang surrounded by crime, drugs, poverty. again, this is what middle red state america sees of these people. finally, why is the trivette the bumbling sidekick, can't you make the sidekick an equal ass-kicker?

this series is formulaic and boring. the episodes are the same thing every week, simply with slightly varied settings. some purely evil character does some dastardly deed, walker goes after him, and it ends in a karate match. the villains are super-cliché super-stereotypical evil villains, the good guys are all pure, honest and saintly, and the story lines are simplistic and unrealistic. after about 2 episodes, the show becomes totally unwatchable by all but the least discerning fans. certainly not norris's best work. his other work may be cliché but it usually does not drag on for weeks. if you enjoy formulaic,boring, repetitive clichéd snooze-fests, then this is for you.

walker texas ranger is one of the worst shows produced in the past 10 years. the script for james 'jimmy' trivette, walker's sidekick, is about as pathetically written of a part as wesley crusher on star trek tng, and is played with about as much conviction.on this show, people don't respond the way people respond to things in real life--everyone is polarized--everyone is either a completely good guy or a completely bad guy (unless walker himself has a 2 minute talk with them and then they change instantly). that's not how life works, that's not how people are. this show doesn't take place in this reality.the plot lines are about as realistic as murder she wrote, a show where an arrogant old lady can just walk into people's houses without them getting angry, and she can demand that police officers do what she wants and they bend over backwards for her. with walker, everyone on the show, including the "bad guys", act like he's the sort of hero that myths and fairy tales are made of, and time itself bends to his whim. the lines that sometimes come out of people's mouths on this show are beyond ridiculous. it's as if the scriptwriter for the part of wesley crusher (for the "serious" parts) and the scriptwriter for bob saget's funniest home videos (for the "humor" parts) got together and wrote all the scripts for this show.this show is for people who think that good always prevails over evil. it's for the elderly. it's for wishful thinkers. it's for people who want to be guaranteed to always have a happy ending. it's for people who want to drift away into oblivion. it's for people whose drug of choice is their television.i cringe every time i see even a commercial for this show. my opinion is that it is the worst show to be on television in the last 10 years.i used to like chuck norris, but this show has forever tainted him in my mind. i can't even watch his older movies without thinking of this show.

this tv show is possibly the most pathetic display of crap on tv today. horribly predictable, obscene usage of slow motion photography, cheesy story lines. chuck norris is an abomination who should never have been allowed to be filmed in anything. the way he chooses to make each episode into a public service announcement is really annoying. his acting sucks so bad that it makes a person cringe with embarrassment. i will give the series some credit though...it does get entertaining at times, but not enough for it make any difference. with all the negative points this series has, i still prefer it over reality tv, it can't really get any more worthless than that.

this show is the worst show ever! norris and his family write it, produce it, direct it, etc etc. the only reason i ever see it is because my goofy wife likes it. how many times can norris fly though the air from plain sight to land a kick on an obviously blind villain? no trees, no building, just whoosh.....thin air. he always solves the case or is the best at whatever skill there is. no co star ever gets the glory. its all norris. its truly apparent that norris is awful stuck on himself and will not allow anyone to one up him in any scene no matter what the content. terrible acting, terrible script, terrible series.

the fact that this cruddy series could elicit dozens of comments (much less hundreds of 'votes') speaks volumes as to the decline of western (or at least american) civilization.read proust, you morons!! or at least dave barry or calvin and hobbes anthologies.chuck norris. wrap your brains around the fact that in order to rate or write about this series you'd have to have spent minutes..nay, hours...viewing this poor sod treading the boards and spewing lines with less emotional impact than the gal who used to call off the correct time on your local service.please don't watch this show!! spare your few remaining brain cells!

first of all, no one with any law enforcement experience (not er or emt, but real law enforcement) takes this show seriously. walker would be drummed out of any police force in the us for his illegal and totally unprofessional tactics. on top of that, he is a comic book character---no acting ability, incredibly trite lines, no character development. the fact that alex cahill loves him shows just how dumb blondes really are. and trivett is the ultimate clown in black-face. come on---if you think walker is a heartfelt show without bias, then explain why jt is treated as a dolt, always is the subject of walker's jokes, never is allowed to be the one to solve the crime, and never rescues walker, who should be dead 50 times over for the stupid things he does. while it may be true that many criminals are even dumber than the detectives who go after them (and believe me, most cops are dumber than dirt), the smart ones walker comes up against never seem to get the point that once walker is captured, the jerk needs to be put of his misery. but then again, norris produced the show as well as starred in it, so how could he willingly get rid of himself or even show how stupid his tactics are. as if six guys are going to wait around to take him one at a time. what a terrible series! it is more demeaning than any of the hokey westerns like the lone ranger, roy rogers, the cisco kid, and wild bill hickock, though i would imagine that most of you on here are far too young to remember those shows. but like those shows, in the same way as those shows, walker tr is just as insulting and just plain silly.

i just don't understand why anytime someone does a show about one of the largest metro areas in the country (houston, dallas, austin/san antonio etc.), they portray the average person as someone who wears wranglers/cowboy hat , talks with a drawl, has zero fashion sense, and drives a truck on his way to either the "saloon" or his next hunting trip, rodeo, skeet shooting or country music concert. i have never even seen a small town cop driving a police-truck...anywhere in texas.the funny thing is this is not done for artistic reasons or comedy...they are actually serious and i guess believe the average person is too stupid to know the difference. the bad scripts and equally bad acting give that away. this show makes goofy shows in the past like knightrider look like high-brow entertainment. at least knightrider had the talking car.

this was a shockingly bad movie and i literally gasped the first time seeing the blue screen puppets. imagine the worst blue screen special effects you ever saw, make it somehow far worse, and then combine this with poorly made, rubber and play-doh puppets that look like something from a semi-retarded pre-school art class. then add some screeching, yngwie malmstein-esquire, melodic-metal guitar solos stuff that is way too loud and lasts way too long. the overall film is absolutely awful and makes "feeders" look like "rashomon." its one of the worst movies i've ever seen, with every quantifiable metric spiraling dismally downward, much like a waterlogged turd in the perpetual, slow whirlpool of a broken rest stop toilet. still, though, a film like "actium maximus" is not to be missed by the bad movie conesseuirs out there, even if only by looking up clips on youtube or someplace. this movie is a bit of an eye opener, if you can stomach the ride. i think this director may be mentally ill, though, which is a bit debasing. watching him discuss the project, you get the sense that he truly believes that he's created something wonderful. i guess he's the "star wars kid" of gonzo filmmakers. what a mess. :-)

ok, what to say about actium maximus...there are some bad movies that are so horribly awful they circle 'round to awesome. there are bad movies that just suck in their own right. there are good movies, and so-so movies, and movies that are just fun. then there's actium maximus. you can't make a spoiler for this movie because to do that you would have to understand the action enough to comment. this particular movie is worse than turkish star wars one and the sequel too. those movies are so bad they circle 'round to awesome and they make you feel drunk even if you're stone cold sober. actium circles 'round from bad to awesome, but then it doesn't stop there, it takes another trip to badville, then 'round again to awesome, then finally it sets up a little feudal kingdom on the border of "bad" and "stock footage of paint drying while a harpy screams incoherently." if you are into self punishment this movie is for you. it actually will cause your brain to hurt.

i got this movie as a buy one get one deal at troma.com with the ruining (which isn't much better). the main reason i wanted it was to see star worms ii: attack of the pleasure pods, the dvd is a double feature with that movie. i really didn't know what actium maximus was at the time, and when i saw the trailer i got scared. it looked awful. but hey, what can you tell from the trailer? well, apparently i could tell a lot. this movie honestly made no sens to me. the special effects were so terrible you cannot tell what in god's name is going on. i understand mark hicks had a extremely low budget, but come on. and it is sad, because in the interview he sounded like this was to be an epic film and meant more than you could see. but sadly, watching the film is one of the most boring hour and 15 minutes of anyone's life. it is so utterly painful to sit through. i really can't even explain the plot to you because i didn't understand it at all and i have sadly seen this film two times! apparently they used some type of puppets for the "alien dinosaurs" like they did in star wars. but these special effects are awful, i can't stress it enough. and most of the time bad special effects are okay but this film needed them badly. it takes place on some futuristic planet where alien dinosaurs battle each other and bad actors in hooded sweatshirts run around, and they look like they are in the kkk. and some box with a blue light on it is the president. i know in the interview mark hicks said something about making this a television pilot, well, i can see why this didn't make it to cbs or nbc. there are two good things about this film. 1. the music is actually pretty good, it has an epic score that sticks in your head for days. and 2. lloyd kaufman's introduction is as always hilarious. overall, don't waste your time but check out star worms ii: attack of the pleasure pods!

this movie is awful, i'm sorry. i bought this to get star worms, and actually expected this to be better after how disappointed i was in star worms. oh just kidding, turns out this is the worst movie i've ever seen. the acting is garbage, not that there really is any, and the main character is a big stupid box who gets attacked by like, stuff or something. i can't really tell. the special effects are so bad that you can't even see the warring dinosaurs, which by the way do not war, but just stand and kind of move their mouths, or whatever those things are. the movie is a headache. it's very obvious the director is trying to establish a universe. hahahahahahahaha... really, this movie is just abominable, even by troma's standards. the only good thing i can say about it is that it's got a lloyd kaufman intro, as he tricks us yet again into watching something that isn't fit for consumption.

a gaggle of unpleasant city dwellers descend on le touquet for a week's holiday. stories intertwine, characters fight, make friends, deceive each other, have sex...blanc has gathered together a stellar cast for his adaptation of connolly's book, but to little avail. what should be hilarious is instead at turns tedious and irritating. all the characters are either pathetic or unpleasant or both, and in the end, despite the farcical nature of things, this viewer was left caring little about what happens to any of them.credit to the always wonderful rampling, plus bouquet and viard but that's it. and dutronc looks like he's rather overdone the nips and tucks, if you ask me...

sickening exploitation trash plays like a bad (and reverse) "death wish" ripoff - but the ugly and untalented tamerlis makes charles bronson look like al pacino with her performance. as for ferrara's "stylish" direction, when a film is so vile, dumb and deeply offensive, it's hard for the viewer to pay attention to such details.

**** mild spoilers _ but you probably know the plot ****woman gets raped and decides to take out her rage on all of mankind . oh did i mention the rape victim was mute ? that`s the problem with ms 45 , thana the rape victim decides she`s going to kill men but is there any logical explanation to any of this ? surely the whole film would have better if we had thana give a voice over as to why she`s bumping off any man she comes across ? there`s just not enough development to this plotas you`d expect from a film by ferrara it`s not a complete waste of time . it`s far better than i spit on your grave and pseudo intellectuals will have a field day pointing out the irony of the woman holding a knife like a penis as thana goes on a killing spree at the end . but the script is somewhat silly and underdeveloped and hinders any serious comment the film could have made

as someone has already mentioned on this board, it's very difficult to make a fake documentary. it requires tremendous skill, pacing, patience, directorial 'distance,' a plausible premise, a narrative 'flow,' and really believable acting (aka great acting). such is not the case with 'love machine'. it starts to show its faux hand about the 20-minute mark (with 60 minutes left to watch), and the viewer starts to realize that he or she is being taken in. it's downhill from there.director gordon eriksen simply peaked too soon. but to be fair to eriksen, his problems started early: as he explains in the extras, he began wanting to do a real doc, couldn't get funding, and settled for a cheaper way of making his film.the premise -- people who have secret lives by posting themselves on a porn website -- was perhaps more interesting in 1997-98, when the film was made. eriksen does a lot of tricky stuff -- a pushy 'host,' hand-held cameras, zooms, grainy blacks and whites -- all, i guess, to elicit a sense of authenticity, but it just doesn't work. the film is confusing and forced, but what ultimately brings it down is the believability of the actors and the pretty awful dialogue.

this movie is truly unbelievable, in every sense of the word. i couldn't believe what i was seeing, and hearing, and i didn't believe it anyhow. hepburn is probably my favorite actress, but this was ridiculous. being a hillbilly myself, i know what it should sound like, and it's not kate's back bay accent. the only thing i found funnier was the fact that the guy who played charlie chan so many times, sydney toler, was cast as another one of the hillbillies, with accent to match. maybe this was a practical joke, come to think of it. i can think of no other reason for such peculiar casting. well, maybe this. i noticed that natalie schaefer, lovey howell on gilligan's island, appeared in this play on broadway. can you imagine what part she might have played?

**** spitfire (1934) john cromwell ~ katharine hepburn, ralph bellamy, robert young mountain hillbilly katharine hepburn (as trigger hicks) is a religious back-woods laundry woman. "going on 18", she begins to attract male attention, and responds by throwing rocks. the arrival of a dam-building construction crew triggers dreams of romance in ms. hepburn. she quickly attracts the attention of suave engineer robert young (as john stafford), who flirtingly hides his marital status. supervising engineer ralph bellamy (as george fleetwood) is also interested in hepburn, but for different reasons; mr. bellamy wants to know more about jesus christ, whom hepburn worships.after hepburn employs the power of prayer to heal a child, neighborhood folks suspect she is a witch.if it weren't so serious, "spitfire" might be more amusing; it is an atypical and wildly inappropriate vehicle for its star, who is thoroughly unconvincing. of the leads, mr. bellamy performs best. however, the best characterization is essayed by sarah haden (as etta dawson), who appeared in george cukor's stage version, along with louis mason (as bill grayson). will geer (as west fry), "grandpa walton" in the 1970s, has a small role. an unexpected ending helps.

this is a really silly job of miscasting--about as bad as hepburn playing a chinese woman in dragon seed. the lead part hepburn plays is a combination of granny from the beverly hillbillies and a faith healer! this film is even worse than bogart's swing your lady, because at least bogart didn't play a hillbilly--he was just surrounded by them. and the dialog sounds as if it comes right from a li'l abner strip! the problems don't really end with the outrageous casting, though, as the plot is completely muddled and the "love story" might make your head hurt. for no reason whatsoever, married robert young falls for this ozark bobcat. was it her lovely personality that won his heart? i doubt it, as she as the fiery "spitfire" the movie was named after and she really seemed to like fightin' and scrappin' and hollerin'! was it her feminine charms? with no makeup and fashions that looked like they were designed by ma kettle, i doubt if this was the case as well. to top this off, in the end, somehow ralph bellamy also fell for her, though once again, it really doesn't seem to make any sense.so, here we have two city fellers fallin' for a scrappy unfeminine she-beast played by ms. hepburn--now that's a recipe for a good film!

katharine hepburn as a mountain woman who mixes prayer with positive thinking--and is thought by the local folk to be a witch. kate works overly-hard trying to convince us she's a backwoods hick (named trigger hicks!), but you can see she doesn't even believe in this unintentionally comical scenario. constantly-smiling robert young plays a foreman working on the construction of a mountain dam who becomes trigger's first crush...but alas, he's married! no amount of white magic can resuscitate this formula, based on a play and brought to the screen by r.k.o. with too broad a hillbilly flourish. it is ungodly, and just about unwatchable. *1/2 from ****

any chance to see katharine hepburn in something i haven't seen or from her early movie career is a treat, and on that level the film is amusing, but she's horrible miscast as a hill billy. her famous new england enunciation slips through, making lines like, "i'd better rustle up some vittles" pretty ludicrous. she's so pretty and so young it almost overcomes this major flaw. the story is an old fashioned melodrama, and there fore, a younger generation may think this pretty corny stuff, but this was the staple of american entertainment well into the 1940's. it has its moments, but you might need to be a die-hard movie buff to appreciate it.

i will never, ever forget watching this show around the age of 13. even at the young age i remember thinking, "this is a baywatch rip off show without the one thing that makes baywatch tolerable. the girls in bathing suits." nonetheless i was too small in those days to be the holder of the remote in my house. the high point of pacific blue was an episode in which a couple of thugged out gangsters are coming to whack someone with submachine guns ... on bikes!!! as a thirteen year old i never laughed so hard at something that was supposed to be taken seriously. even i knew that the task of going out and acquiring uzis (for murder) is a task that should never come before borrowing someones car for the day. that had been the defining moment of this show. simple crimes and situations tailor made by hack writing so they could be taken care of by the unsung hero of the crime fighting world the bike cop. does not get much dumber.

this is one of the few movies - maybe the only - that truly haunted me for years. it was the first i had ever seen people tortured, so much that blood was flowing of their mouths from gritting their teeth and screaming, etc. it was brutal; the worst thing i had ever seen on film.dr. clement molloch, played by joseph mayer, is still one of the most evil characters i've ever seen on film, and i've viewed thousands. he was so sadistic that i would never watch this movie again, nor would i recommend it. he makes hannibal lecter look like mr. rogers. if seeing people tortured is not your idea of fun, then stay away from this film.i know there are a lot of sick people out there, many of them professional film critics, who probably enjoyed this sordid, sick story. it's a "b" movie, anyway, with stupid dialog and some wooden acting by charles bronson. this is not one of his better efforts. even if it was, there so many horrendous scenes in here you wouldn't want to watch. trust me on this one.

does anyone remember the alternative comedy show the comic strip presents . one edition featured charles bronson ( robbie coltrane ) being interviewed about his new movie glc :" it's about a man , an ordinary man whose wife and family gets wiped out by creeps and i have to hunt them down and kill them in a sadistic and graphic manner " " and after glc what next for bronson ? " " we're using a new angle . my family don't get wiped out but i go after creeps just the same " this accurately describes the evil that men do . it's a bronson vigilante thriller where his motivation isn't down to a blood feud but this leads to credibility becoming strained bronson is a retired hit-man who isn't giving up his retirement for anything until someone shows him a video tape featuring interviews with the victims of " the doctor " , not the legendary time traveler but a infamous expert on torture . it's never really explained why the doctor is so infamous since any police state has a myriad of these sadists nor is it explained why the doctor and his sister have ridiculous english accents as you may guess it's a lazily written movie and incidents happening because the screenwriter needs things to happen to further the plot no matter how unlikely they are like one of the bad guys getting invited to a threesome so he can be killed or things being revealed like the doctor's sister being a lesbian so some t&a can be included in many ways it's like one of those nasty chuck norris vehicles that were being released at the same time , but the most disappointing thing is that the director is also the same man who made ice cold in alex and the guns of naverone two very well regarded war dramas that are often shown on sunday afternoons . believe me this movie won't be shown until well after the watershed

it's hard to believe that there are some people out there in the world that actually think this is a worthy charles bronson vehicle. bronson is a good actor that can do more than tote a gun and knock off bad guys. he was quietly moving in the tv movie "yes virginia, there is a santa claus" and showed a lot of class and style in the sean penn-directed "the indian runner".in "the evil that men do", however, bronson again plays a character that sees injustice and sets it right with fists, knives and, of course, guns. there's nothing here you haven't seen in the last five "death wish" flicks. wait, i take that back. this has to be the most sadistic and repellently violent film bronson has ever had the dis-service of being in. not just repellent in the scenes of torture or the descriptions of torture, but in the fact that these scenes were put in a film just to sell tickets. and jose ferrer! what in blue blazes was he doing here?!! i mean, he won an oscar, for crying out loud!!! okay, sorry about that outburst. let me just say that "the evil that men do" has to be one of the worst movies i had ever seen that was based on a book. yeah, that's right. i wonder if it was written with bronson in mind?no stars. watch "death wish" instead. at least it was topical.

once again bronson's talent is mostly wasted on this shock value 1984 thriller which (uncut) is far more disturbing than most of what is out even today. the fact that "the evil that men do" is very disturbing (in its verbal and visual depictions of torture) is not the problem. it is the shameless gratuity in which it is presented. interestingly, this film seems to symbolize that latter part of bronson's career in which he has tortured many of his fans with the same egregiously predictable and uncreative plots. one hopes this fine actor will rise again.

yet again, director j. lee thompson unites with actor charles bronson for a violent and uncompromising action flick. in fact, this is probably bronson's most brutal film (quite a feat for a man who appeared in death wish, ten to midnight and chato's land). however, brutality doesn't on its own make for a good film, and the evil that men do is ultimately a disappointment. if you were to take away its brutality the film would have precious little else of interest. the story is about a retired hitman (bronson) who lives a cosy life on a caribbean island. he is persuaded to come out of retirement to track down and eliminate a sadistic torture doctor who has been plying his vile trade around various south american hell-holes. throughout the film, especially at the beginning, we are treated to some graphic torture scenes to show us just what a nasty piece of work he is. these themes are actually quite serious. torture does go on in suppressive latin american dictatorships, and everyday folk are made to suffer some despicably painful experiences simply for voicing an unpopular viewpoint. but the evil that men do - for all its worthy posturing - isn't really bothered about the plight of these poor people. it is bothered purely with giving charles bronson an excuse to blow away some unpleasant scum-bags. it's just an exploitative actioner which hangs its coat on genuine issues. the torture sequences make you, the viewer, feel like a dirty, sick-in-the-head voyeur, rather like someone who gains pleasure from viewing "snuff" movies. the script is full of horrid dialogue, including some excessive descriptions of acts of torture. the evil that men do fails to explore its disturbing ideas... its serves them up as entertainment and asks us to enjoy them. sorry, but that's just wrong.

during an eight-year stretch of the 1980s when charles bronson made nine films, only one was released by a company other than the cannon group: 'the evil that men do,' a tristar films pickup from sir lew grade's itc entertainment firm. bronson was already in the thick of his collaborations with director j. lee thompson, which ran through numerous actioners until 'kinjite: forbidden subjects' in 1989.expectations should run pretty high with bronson and thompson working for a better-funded outfit like itc, but 'the evil that man do' is a great disappointment on many levels. while still from the low budget, b-movie mold of the 1980s, 'evil' has tantalizing potential for a great film. everyone in the production department, however, took an easy way out and sold hack work undeserving of bronson's imprint. 'the evil that men do' had a concept and technical resources that could have been used to make one of bronson and thompson's best films, but instead will go down as one of their most average.this 1984 political thriller/actioner opens in brutal fashion with clement molloch (joseph maher), a british doctor, holding his special training class for political leaders in surinam. the gray-haired, passive molloch is an expert on torture methods who is employed by numerous political regimes. in the opening seven minutes, we witness molloch using electrical current to inflict unbearable pain on jorge hidalgo (jorge humberto robles), a dissident journalist. as you may expect, the scene is awful to watch and was cut from the original vhs release.hidalgo was none other than a friend of holland (bronson), a retired assassin who is enjoying life in the cayman islands. holland was approached by the journalist years before to rid humanity of molloch, but turned the offer down. a mexican professor named hector lomelin (josé ferrer) visits shortly after hidalgo's death to talk holland into finishing the job, bringing videotapes of testimony from the doctor's victims. while in denial at first, holland eventually agrees to the dirty work, targeting molloch and his doting sister claire (antoinette bower) in guatemala.holland enters guatemala city with help from an adviser, max ortiz (rené enríquez); he poses as a tourist with hidalgo's widow rhiana (theresa saldana) and young daughter sarah (amanda nicole thomas) in tow. as with most of bronson's later output, his character knocks off molloch's henchmen one by one, crossing paths with a sleazy american diplomat (john glover) and his supporting hit-man (roger cudney) along the way. a brutal ending takes place in the crevices of an opal mine, where the doctor gets just deserts from several of his victims.'the evil that men do' is based on a forgotten novel by r. lance hill and jumps at american political dealings in latin america during the 1980s. indeed, 'evil' is hard-boiled in every sense of the term, as it uses sensationalism and doses of brutality to cover up huge weaknesses in plot and character development. for every plus this film has, there are three or four minuses, resulting from shod craftsmanship.while 'the evil that men do' has a great concept, the film is never truly more than an excuse for bronson to wipe out foreign-based scum. in the style of bad pulp fiction, 'evil' is filled with cardboard characters that we never get to know or understand. holland, despite being played strongly by bronson, never talks about his inner feelings or explains what motivated him into becoming a killer for hire. rhiana, a terribly weak part for theresa saldana, is disgusted by holland for much of the way but later feels an affection for him. where does her love come from, especially after watching holland kill several people and wanting to go home just a few scenes before?the most interesting characters are actually molloch and his sister claire, because so many questions can be asked of them. naturally, we never find out what has brought them so close together, how and where their torture dealings started, what claire's exact role in their business isthese plot holes can go on forever, especially with the paint-by-numbers storyline that seems to make things up as it goes along. why is hidalgo's daughter brought into such a dangerous situation, other than for her to be conveniently taken hostage by molloch? if molloch's bodyguard randolph (raymond st. jacques) clearly saw holland and rhiana in the cockfight arena, why is he so friendly with them in a bar afterwords? is his memory that short? and what really was the purpose, other than cheap theatrics, of holland throwing molloch's chauffeur cillero (jorge luke) off a window ledge when the murder could have been handled more discreetly in claire's apartment?the overall acting is decent and somehow bronson gives one of his strongest performances. j. lee thompson's direction is lacking at points, but may have been compromised by limited time on site. besides evil's filming in mexico, the presence of itc is clear through better production values, cinematography, and music. rural locations are well-used to convey the hot and dusty atmosphere of latin america and cinematographer xavier cruz provides rich color and clarity. the orchestral score by ken thorne ('murphy's war') is refreshing in an era of synthesized junk. oddly enough, these positives only add to the frustration of a good movie that is screaming to come out. peter lee thompson's editing is better than usual, although with more laughable continuity errors.'the evil than men do' was perfect grindhouse material for the early 80s and i find it hard to recommend for 21st century action fans. the dvd from columbia tristar entertainment is an okay presentation, offering widescreen and standard format with four-language subtitles. while the video quality is well above average, 'evil' was originally recorded in plain mono audio. the theatrical trailer is offered and actually has a grindhouse feel, with eroded color and fuzzy sound quality.** out of 4

originally, the spiders was planned as a four-part serial, and it shows. i dislike serials; they're typically ridiculous, convoluted and banal. this one is no exception. in the first part of the spiders, 'the golden lake,' a rich adventurer thwarts the plans of a gang of criminals--the spiders--to steal gold from incas. a silly love triangle ensues, with some cowboys and indians action. the sensationalism and exotica of it didn't entertain me.one can legitimately trace themes from this two-part series to lang's later, far superior work. and, the film-making is better than in other serials i've seen from this time, including 'les vampires' (1915). in the spiders, the camera isn't as static, and this film is fast paced, thankfully. the tinting and lighting are adequate, too. none of that's remarkable, though. it's nearly unseemly, however, in how closely this series resembles louis feuillade's serials; the criminal gang dresses and behaves like those in 'les vampires'--only the names, and to a lesser extent, the situations have changed.for the further comments on the spiders series, see the web pages for it.

i'm usually a fan of "art" and "foreign" films, but when i saw this one my reaction was "it must be called experimental because it makes no sense." the "action" is static, while at the same time it bounces from one location to another. there aren't enough titles to make it clear who is who and what their relationships are. apparently the main point was to show that in the face of murder, adultery and generally weird and dissolute behavior, the cure offered by the powers that be is to banish a totally innocent black man.

this experimental silent film, made in switzerland by an independent british film company, is chiefly remembered as paul robeson's first film. it's very artistic, with shots often seeming meaningless to the story, which is difficult to understand anyway because of the lack of enough inter-titles. from what i gathered, robeson's wife, adah, is in an inter-racial love affair with a white man called thorne. it doesn't bother the cigar-chomping owner of the bar/hotel where thorne lives (and she seems to be having a lesbian relationship with a barmaid), but an old lady expresses the town's point of view in an inter-title: "if i had my way, we wouldn't allow negroes in here." thorne is also called "nigger lover" by someone in the bar. adah tries a reconciliation with pete (robeson), but eventually leaves him. thorne's wife, astrid, goes off the deep end, brandishes a knife, cuts thorne's arm and cheek, and somehow dies. thorne must have been accused of murder because we learn he was acquitted. as for pete, he gets a letter from the mayor telling him it is best for everyone that he leave town. so the film is more about racism than anything, but in an up note, the owner tells pete "the sad thing is, they think they're right. that's the way we are." the meaning of the title is a mystery. it may refer to adah being light-skinned (a borderline negro) or to the borderline behavior of of the main characters.

this film is about a struggling actor trying to find satisfaction in life, especially love which he has not had a taste of for 5 years.it basically is a film featuring a man with very poor social skills, and he says wrong things all the time. the plot is hollow and contrived. the main character, james, is lonely, but this theme of loneliness is not adequately explored. it is more like an empty statement which other subplots stem from. sadness and disappointment after being dumped are superficial. there is a serious lack of emotions in the film.it is not funny as a comedy either. there are some funny one liners but that is it. it lacks the happy and uplifting atmosphere to infect people with happy mood. i don't find "i want someone to eat cheese with" funny.

this is indeed a spectacularly bad film, but it is the rare kind of badness that is endlessly, jaw-droppingly entertaining! i want to add to the other comments on this film.the "rock band" on the plane look like three skinny drunks from casual labor wearing bad wigs.watch for the severe continuity problem with the kid's stuffed tiger: it turns into a lion, a leopard and back again; it's filthy or clean depending on the shot.*spoiler! the stuffed tiger turns into a real animal to save the kid (and the writers)!the sight of little jimmy floating down the amazon in a coffin, clutching his stuffed tiger and squalling away will stick permanently in your memory. listen for one of the most inept sound effects ever: late in the story when the priest is setting out to find jimmy, the guide demands his monk's robes as payment-the priest drops on one knee in a moment of resigned contemplation and there is the sound of a bell, not the deep "bonnnng" of a church bell, but the "ding" of a bell from a boxing match!this is an absolute hoot to watch.

if there's anything worse than this movie i don't want to see it. i remember so many amazing things--a nun dropped out of a coffin to make a raft for a little blond boy; the little blond boy himself adored as a god; lots of stock footage of peru as an ideal vacation spot. shining path and alberto fujimori should blast away any notion that peru is a vacation paradise. the whole thing is so awful that plan 9 or even robot monster is an aesthetic treat by comparison. this film should be bombed and strafed and bombed again.

it borrowed scenes from lotr, matrix, star wars, etc. the humor is so dry, contrived, and corny, that you can't help but laugh occasionally at its inanity and the fact that you are watching it. exactly what you'd expect from an hk comedy. the average person would enter with an iq of 100 and leave with less than 80. stephen chow is an obvious omission from this movie. the humor would have worked better with stephen. the mandarin version of this movie is not as good as the cantonese original. the graphics are poor compared to its hollywood counterparts. there is overdependence on low quality cg. my biggest complaint is its ending. the origin of the white horse is so clearly described in the "journey to the west" (jw), that this alternate explanation does not work well with story line. despite its many flaws this movie has far more entertainment value than the other movie nicholas tse starred in--the promise.

first there was tsui hark's zu warriors (2001), which is visually ground-breaking, but much lacking in the acting and writing departments, now this movie, which is visually almost as good as zu (though no longer ground-breaking), but is even worse in the acting and writing departments. it's really sad that there seems to be an almost complete lack of acting and writing talents in the hk movie industry. i guess you need to understand cantonese to understand how bad and vulgar the dialogs in the movie really are. it's like some delinquent kids talking in the street, it's that bad. to make it worse, the actors and actresses themselves look like delinquent kids, and can't act even if their life depend on it. i understand that this movie is supposed to be a comedy aimed at the younger generation in hk, but has hk youths really become so brain-dead that they can't appreciate anything but such juvenile and vulgar acting/writing? if that's the case, it makes me ashamed to be from hk.i wish hk movie makers will learn some lessons from directors like zhang yi-mou or ang lee, and finally make a movie that's both visually stunning as well as competent and mature in the acting and writing departments. and stop using young singers/idols/heartthrobs as actors because they can't act however many fans they may have in hk!

it's like someone took a fantasy-type video game and put it in a blender, and the resulting scene mishmash is what we have to sit through.now let me go on record by saying how much i love chinese fantasy films. from the fun and silly, to those focusing on martial arts, to the more dramatic and romantic typesit's a genre i very much enjoy. films like "a chinese odyssey: pandora's box" and "a chinese odyssey: cinderella" (both of which were written and/or directed by jeffrey lau); "the bride with white hair"; "butterfly & sword"; "green snake"; "a chinese ghost story"; "swordman ii"; "zu: warriors from the magic mountain"; "crouching tiger, hidden dragon"; and others. which is why i was looking forward to "a chinese tall story." one of the film's characters is the "monkey king" (aka sun wukong), an extremely well-known character in chinese mythology, first told in the stories of the "journey to the west," the epic adventure written about 500 years ago. (the story of the monkey king and his disciples is also the focus of the "chinese odyssey" films, amongst many others). other familiar characters that appear in the film are zhu wuneng (the pig character) and sha wujing.so how does it all go wrong? well, let's take an example familiar to western audiences. how about the robin hood mythology? a well known story from ye olden days. let's say that our robin hood film starred wesley snipes as robin hood, and haley joel osment as friar tuck. maid marian is none other than rosie perez. let's give sir robin an uzi as well, because you never know when you might have to waste the sheriff of nottingham. they might need rocket packs also, and while we're at it, give them a tactical nuclear weapon because that sure could come in handy. if you think this sounds like a really neat retelling of the robin hood tale, then "a chinese tall story" is the movie for you! as i indicated above, this movie is a jumbled mess. in the first 30 minutes, we are introduced not only to sun wukong, zhu wuneng, and sha wujing, but also to the monk tripitaka (who is actually the main protagonist), kidnapped children, a "millennium bug demon" (which shoots laser beams), an underground tree god, a lizard imp tribe, an angelic girl in an intergalactic egg, the lord chancellor tortoise, a sea dragon king, a ever-morphing magic golden staff, a chatterbox imp girl, wormholes in space, and the four heavenly knights. all this wouldn't be too bad--the tales and myths passed down over the years certainly do have all sorts of fantastical elements. but i guarantee you the chinese mythology does not include much of the stuff we get subjected to in the last half of the film. (helpful advice to the filmmakers: just because your computer effects guys can come up with cool looking spaceships and depictions of intergalactic war, does not mean they should).you know your chinese mythology movie is on the wrong track when the director asks (and i am not making this upit's a direct quote from the commentary) "i asked the composer whether or not we can have a more rock-and-roll type music when she transforms into some kind of android-like thing." is there a story hidden in here somewhere? yes. yes, there is. most of the adventure follows tripitaka (played by nicholas tse"gen-x cops," "time and tide," "my schoolmate the barbarian") and meiyan, the lizard imp girl (played by charlene choi and a computer). choi is the best thing going in this film. you may know her as half of the canto-pop group "twins" and from other films such as "the twins effect" (a fun flick) and "just one look" (a surprisingly good drama/romance/comedy). poor choi, being a lizard imp and all, is hardly recognizable with her warts, snagged out teeth, doughy nose, and hunched back. that is until the computers get a hold of and beautify her, which somehow makes it worse. tse is passable, but all of the supporting actors were abysmal. a couple of recognizable faces in bit parts are wasted.at one point i was debating with myself if "a chinese tall story" was a spoof. i was almost able to convince myself that it was when the intergalactic egg girl (played by a very pretty fan bing-bing) got out and lit up a marlboro (!) while talking with tripitaka who was practicing martial arts dressed in a spider-man costume (!!). but it is not a spoof. of course there is the typical hong kong silliness, but the movie takes itself seriously enough, with enough scenes of romance and pathos (scored with a sledghammering of violins and evocative cellos) and rousing action and adventure.you might think that you could watch this on a netflix rental and it wouldn't cost you anything. (oh, but it'll cost you, all right).is there anything good to say? sure. the colors are vibrant (they are the best thing about this movie). and the filmmakers certainly were trying very hard. too bad all that effort went into a movie that is not much more than a bad video game.

i was watching the beginning of this on a friday, mid-day, while working at computer at home, relaxing a bit after a hectic week, and cleaning-up some files and answering some communications. got interrupted a couple of times, so had trouble getting all the details straight (although it's hardly a work of hitchcock proportions, where missing a detail can through the whole story off-kilter), and besides it was not exactly an "engrossing" piece of work.so during a commercial, read the only prior comment here (by "mgconlan-1"), and pretty much can agree with its details.not quite in the category of a film so awful it is fascinatingly "good," but i'd like to catch on tape when run again (rather than seeing it as aired), so i can fast forward as needed and see the parts which i missed this first time.give it a "3*" because of the attractiveness of the four primary characters.

i do not know what some of these filmmakers are thinking, by making the same type of clichéd film over and over, where the bad guys (bad girls in this case) win. weak acting and very predictable. nothing original about it. this same movie has been made over and over again- not different from goodbye lover (1989), slow burn (2005), or at least ten other movies with the exact same storyline and ending. there are a lot of holes in the movie too. it is as if they ran out of money and just stopped filming. or perhaps they ran out of ideas. but do not waste your time with this one. it will only leave you upset by having wasted your time watching it.

i saw this movie considering this as a normal hollywood movie but then came to know that its a movie made for tv channel.on my dvd cover out of 2 critics comments one of the critic stephen farber from moviline reveiwed it as a best movie of the year..all the character were simple and decent performances except the brain's character which never gets scope which director wanted to keeps mystery till end.. there was suspense till end but when you see the end that lady police officer and main culprit had a lesbian affair seems to be totally stupid idea.god knows what happens to dave the male lead character..the other critic from mr. brown's movies said that shocking and effective but doesn't quite live up to all the hype... which i saw after watching the movie .for which i was partially aggree...i should have read this first before taking the movie..

all i can say is, this movie is made for the lifetime channel on tv, which means no solid characters, no particular style, weak acting all kinds of suggested sex but no-breasts and tushs (because boy, that would just catapult the film into the depths of sleaze wouldn't it?) but the heavily simulated sex, well, that's ok. when watching these films i have to ask myself, when will these types of tv channels and their advertisers ever grow up? i think these companies are actually way behind the times. they really have no clue what the younger generation is in tune with and if they knew they would demand we change. the whole point of many american tv channels like these seems mostly to regurgitate the same sanitized, diluded garbage over and over like a generic movie assembly line. i guess it works for them... or at least it has. not sure about the future though. don't bore yourself to death like i did. seek out some real tv movies on hbo, showtime, ifc, starz, etc. any channel that puts effort into their work and doesn't have to ask a priest what they can or cannot show.

the lifetime channel aired this in october but i only got around to watching it now. it's the old eternal triangle again  small-town connecticut boy dave ford (matt long) has a quick fling with his best friend's girlfriend, emily darrow (emmanuelle chriqui), on the eve of his departure for law school in new york, thinks about her for the next five years while he isn't doing contracts and briefs, runs into her again when he returns home after the death of his father on the eve of a big exam five years later, and gets involved with her romantically again. but director and co-writer matthew cole weiss goes way over the top, framing the whole thing in flashback as dave confesses to murdering emily, her husband and another one of her lovers in front of (here comes the spoiler) a lesbian cop who's also a flame of emily's. weiss overdoes the "flanging" effect by which dave gets to see chunks of his previous life flash before his eyes even before he's actually dead, cutting those in even while dave and emily are having sex and thereby ruining the soft-core porn shots that give even some otherwise pretty lame lifetime movies at least a bit of audience appeal. i couldn't help but flash back myself to james m. cain and how much better he wrote women like this in his classic thrillers (all adapted into hit movies) "the postman always rings twice," "double indemnity" and "mildred pierce." it also doesn't help that the film ends with the bad guys (the bad girls, actually) triumphant and the decent, if naïve and stupid, hero seemingly on his way to the lethal injection table  or that the actors playing the people dave and emily are cheating on are both better looking than they are. incidentally, though this film went straight to cable in the u.s. there were some blank spots on the soundtrack indicating where swear words were blipped, so i presume this got a theatrical release somewhere in the world.

saw this as part of the dc reel affirmations film festival. i hope they got better movies than this, because this film failed to deliver on any of the hopes that audience may have entertained, from the fantasy of seeing james franco without his shirt, down to more simple wishes, such as decent acting, coherent direction, character development, or actual production values. plagued by film school effects such as freeze frames to show moments of emotional distress, and obvious influences ranging from my own private idaho to terminator 2, this film failed on almost every level to engage the audience. after the first twenty minutes of valiantly trying to take it seriously, the audience collectively threw up it's hands and just started to enjoy the inherent crappiness of the film. i could be upset that i paid nine bucks to see it, and it was two hours i'll never get back, but on the other hand, it was an entertaining two hours i'll never get back. this would have been a classic mystery science 3000 episode.

a quick, funny coming-of-age matinée romp appealing to the underdog aldolescent in us all. it functions, in effect, as a vehicle for justin long who has subsequently erupted onto our screens in the fourth die hard via pc vs mac ads, dodgeball and the break up. he's funny, earnest and young - a big career ahead.a town's worth of college wannabes find a fake website bartelby (long) has set up to delude his judgemental parents and descend on the 'college' like it were a short notice facebook party. lewis black summises the anarchic philosophy as a stand-in dean - long's delinquent friends provide support for the subterfuge and consequent appeal to grander traditions of education and friendship (adam herschman deserves special mention for his never-flagging slapstick contribution). well executed, feelgood and instantly forgettable. 4/10

i wasn't so impressed with this film, finding it quite tiresome and plain. the plot line was interesting, a kid creating his own college and enrolling hundreds of kids, but the laughs were few and far between. the jokes weren't really funny and i didn't bust a gut at any of the scenes. the characters weren't intriguing and i didn't feel for any of them, even the dawky, fat kid with glasses who tried to enter the frat group. it was a good first watch, but it didn't blow me away and its not one that i would recommend. comparing it to other films in the same genre, ie, american pie is just cruel, because there is a film which was laugh-a-plenty. this accepted failed to raise a smile!

inane, awful farce basically about a young man who refuses to conform or better uses non-conformity to attain his objectives-fool his parents into thinking that he is attending a college. truth is that this jerk has been rejected by every school he has applied to. after viewing this junk, you will see why.what a ridiculous name- south hampton institute of technology. you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out the initials of this school of nonsense. problem with these type of films is that in the end, the non-conformist becomes the accepted mode.let's step back to the world of reality and call this film what it really is- excessive manipulative junk!

i see absolutely nothing funny---even remotely funny---in this stupid movie. an unrealistic, silly, ridiculous idea--just completely ridiculous. hard to believe that the main character, who seems so articulate, intelligent and imaginative, would not be accepted to any college. even more difficult to believe is that no one shut the place down. the actors portrayed characters straight out of characterville. we have seen their lot many a time over in many films. nothing new here. i found it on late night tv, and since there was really nothing else on, i watched the whole boring, stupid film. what a total waste. maybe if you are a teenager, you may find it amusing. films are made for an immature mind, so teens, go for it. the rest, no way.

let me start by saying that there's really no reason to watch this movie. i only sat through it because i was trying to kill some time before going to work.basically, it's your typical sophomoric "comedy" aimed at the teenage set. there's nothing remarkable about it other than the complete ridiculousness of the story, not to mention that there are plot holes big enough to sail a carnival cruise-liner through. obviously this isn't supposed to be a realistic movie, it's supposed to be funny. sadly, it mostly fails on that count as well. i must admit that i laughed a few times, but mainly in a "holy sh*t, i can't believe how stupid this is" kind of way.if you never see this movie you're not missing a thing.

seriously, i don't understand how justin long is becoming increasingly popular. he either has the best agent in hollywood, or recently sold his soul to satan. he is almost unbearable to watch on screen, he has little to no charisma, and terrible comedic timing. the only film that he has attempted to anchor that i've remotely enjoyed was waiting... and that is almost solely because i've worked in a restaurant. but i digress. aside from it's terrible lead, this film has loads of other debits. i understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence, and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive. lewis black's considerable talent is wasted here too, as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained, which the pg-13 rating certainly won't allow. the film's sole bright spot was jonah hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim). his one liners were funny on occasion, but were certainly not enough to make this anywhere close to bearable. if you just want to completely turn your brain off (or better yet, don't have one) then maybe you'd enjoy this, but i can't recommend it at all.

this movie was downright awful. most of the comedic scenes seem stale and trite, and possibly the funniest scene in the movie had already been given away in previews. the entire premise of the movie is so unbelievable and ridiculous its hard to really get into it. the actors themselves portray the most unrealistic characters. its not just the fact that the movies so hard to swallow, but its how they keep forcing it down your throat expecting you to dumb down and accept it. the plot itself is so shallow and easy to predict. boy somehow gets rejected from every school he applied to(i suppose he completely forgot about attending community college) and decides to create his own school for fellow rejects. all goes well for awhile until the validity of his school comes into question. all the while the dorky character manages to woo his beautiful neighbor into falling for him with his witty sarcasm, which apparently is a skill only he possesses. then comes the final struggle with the students somehow all bonding together and fighting for the survival of the school. of course the main character then persuades the state board of education to allow his school to stay alive with some "inspirational" speech. this movie would have been more fun to watch if i was under the age of 16 and still ignorant of all college matters and issues.

synopsis: kid is not accepted into any colleges. he creates a "college" where he and his friends can party by using their parent's tuition money. wow. a paean to ignorance. if you believe that we're all ok, man, then this movie is for you. furthermore, you must understand that:1. kids have it all inside them--they just need to let it out.2. teaching really stifles the innate creativity that everyone is born with. 3. someone else should pay for you to follow your passion. 4. 300 teenagers can live together in harmony, as long as you take away those restrictive rules. 5. extemporaneous speeches are often much more convincing than a prepared presentation. 6. if the board of education allows you to open a "charter school" with "nontraditional teaching techniques," it's because they have your best interests at heart. (not that they are willing to let go of low-functioning students who will end up working fast food anyways.) this movie is one in the college comedy genre, i.e. animal house. it follows the pattern pretty closely. what's new here though, is a complete attack on higher education, not a parody of the bad elements. it's missing the sympathetic insider, a professor who embodies the worthwhile part of university life. this lack of balance will doom this film to the back rows of blockbuster. it is so one sided, that i wondered if it was an ironic self-referential take on the whole genre--for about one minute. the movie has no deep meaning, no layers, no introspection. it's as if they let some kids who never went to class do what comes naturally. and what is natural is what the name of the school is: s***. (never thought i'd say this: go see something with will farrell instead. his comedies can be surprisingly sophisticated.)

the most accurate description of how billy crystal fairs in "my giant" is to say that this movie is to his career as "ishtar" was to warren beaty's - it didn't ruin it, but it slowed it down.......a lot. crystal should know the three golden rules of hollywood: 1) never play opposite a kid 2) never play opposite an animal 3) never play opposite someone that is almost 3 feet taller than you, is as innocent as a kid and "acts" like an animal.what is this story? a comedy? i guess, but i didn't laugh, except at the scenes where crystal is on his own and not burdened with his (what-is-her-role-in-this-movie) ex-wife or the afore-mentioned giant. did i mention there's also a kid in this film? well, forget about him. the son is brought in to make us feel sorry for crystal, and we do, but for the actor, not the character. billy crystal is a funny man. if you don't believe me, watch him in old episodes of "soap" or "saturday night live." go rent "city slicker" or "running scared" or "when harry met sally.""giant" is more ho-hum than fee-fi-fo-fum.

this is one of the most predictable movies i have ever seen. and this supposed to be funny..... boring, boring, boring. find the fast forward button at your remote and use it... i can`t say i laughed once, and the only good feeling this movie gave me was relief when it ended.

i'm still laughing- not! i'm still asking my myself what the point was. i barely got a chuckle, this movie sucks. it tries to be charming and touching, but it turns out stupid. i do not recommend it.

i saw this movie a while ago and i was looking forward to it. my biggest problem was having seen the trailer i was expecting a very stylish marshal arts movie with plenty of action and maybe a bit of plot to think about along the way. i was sorely disappointed as it would seem that once you have seen the trailer there is nothing else worth watching (if what you are expecting is as described above). my girlfriend at the time gave up half way through and whilst i continued to watch in the hope that something interesting might happen... nothing did. i found no attachment or real interest in any of the characters. i would say just don't bother unless you have a few hours of your life that you don't really care about losing.

since this show was changed from tss (the screen savers) to aots (attack of the show)it has gone down hill. tss with yoshi and kevin rose alex... etc. made the show awesome, then they got fired from tss for an unknown reason. when the show switched to aots, it became less about computers, and more about gaming and magazines. it also promoted bands that nobody had heard of, or cared about. finally i couldn't watch it anymore once kevin rose left. he kept it interesting, but he went off to do his own thing, which is good. kevin rose now has several online pod casts, and shows, etc on the rev 3 network. check it out. rev3.com i think, you can get to it by going to www.systm.org. if you want a real tech show rather than aots, then go watch kevin roses shows or listen to the twit podcast.j<

this show is what happened to the screen savers after g4 got its hands on it, taking it from a useful source of computer-related information to a show that had as its high point the shoving of a miniature web server up someone's posterior.as g4's ratings plummeted, they moved away from their original target audience, gamers, to generic hormone-driven young men, adding eye candy to the staff and a sex advice segment. now even the gamers who applauded the show initially are turning away in disgust. i look forward to the show's, and the network's, overwhelmingly overdue and well-deserved demise.

as a flagship show, attack of the show (aots) is endemic of the larger fall of g4 tv; it is a show (and a station) that has fallen so far that it parades sex to try and cover its glaring faults. its predecessor, the screen savers, was a venue for troubleshooting technology problems and scouting out the latest and greatest in technology. it was a nice show with a likable staff and it was fun to see some of the modding and other experiments the crew could put to together.the acquisition of techtv by g4 bothered some longtime fans of the station, but early returns were actually promising. the emphasis on gaming was a nice addition and i really enjoyed a lot of the coverage of e3 and other big entertainment events.unfortunately, aots now stands as but a shell of its former self. those overseeing the channel have shifted the focus of the channel away from technology and gaming and toward anything that might elicit drool from young adult men. the result is that aots spends as much time parading olivia munn or touting the adult film industry as it does covering games. it is so bad it is practically unwatchable.while some may get puerile joy out of this sort of thing, those who genuinely enjoy gaming may wonder where the good coverage went. equally troubling, young gamers who might tune into g4 thinking their getting gaming - that active gaming group between 10-15 - are instead being fed things aimed toward a more mature audience. on a channel like hbo or cinemax, things like that are expected. on g4, it's tragic.at least spiketv, another male-aimed channel, has good programming like csi. aots, and g4, has very little good left to offer.too bad, really.

this meandering tale of mob revenge is simply not very interesting, even with ed mcmahon in a ripe role as the chief heavy. jim brown kicks ass effectively, gloria hendry proves again that she can bring life to even the poorest roles, and brock peters is decent as the cop who plays by the book. it's still dull and badly constructed, and even the print shown on cable is now emasculated of its original james brown score.

i'm a fan of the 1950's original and about 20 minutes into this remake i started to think this was going to be as good as the original but it wasn't. the motive for the murders was incredibly stupid. two of the lovers in the movie turn out to be brother and sister-excuse me while i barf. the main character stops in the middle of the movie to have sex which doesn't make sense considering the situation he's in. if the film makers wanted a sex scene they should have put it earlier in the movie before the main character (dexter played by dennis quaid found he's about to die and that he's accused of a crime. there is a reason for where the sex scene is at. early in the movie dexter isn't living life to the fullest so he's not interested in sleeping with meg ryan. i still feel it would make more sense for the sex scene to have either been cut or earlier in the film and the two siblings not to have been lovers.one of the dumbest parts of the movie involves a gun fight, a couple people getting killed and one person being run over all within 15 yards of a crowded carnival and yet nobody at the carnival notices!!! also in the scene is the tar pits the university where the movie takes place is built on. if you fall into the tar you sink to the bottom and in a matter of seconds. not only is it hard to believe stuff would sink that fast in tar, but more importantly who builds a university on tar pits. i would say more about how stupid the end of the movie is but i don't want to put a spoiler in my post.

great story and great lead actors (quaid and ryan) but the movie suffers from bad directing,bad screenplay and bad script.the lead actors do their part but could not save the movie at all.too bad because this could have been a good 80's style hitchcock suspense/mystery/thriller.ryan looked so young and fresh in this one though.an ok look for big ryan fans.....

rudolph maté's film from 1950 is given a revamp for the 80's, dexter cornell(dennis quaid) is a university lecturer who used to have a successful writing career, but thats now gone down the tubes along with his marriage. the initial exposition plants the notion in the viewers mind that everybody has something against him, so when the revelation comes that he has been poisoned, we are not that surprised, unless of course you are familiar with the original. dexter after being told he has less than 48hrs to live, decides to trace back his steps with the help of one of his students sydney fuller(meg ryan), but they find they have many obstacles in their way.the film begins promisingly in black and white, as dexter staggers in the rain towards the local police station where he wishes to report a murder...his own, but the huey lewis style 80's beat that accompanies this scene only serves to remove any sense of tension and tells the viewer that this is going to be pretty bad, its only a question of how bad? sure enough we are soon using the old flashback medium, but now the film resorts to full technicolor. there are some brief homages to noir, as the embracing couple stand in front of a venetian blind, but there's really nothing here to recommend it, the performances are awful, ryan in particular doing her usual dizzy blonde with a cutesy pie smile routine. the film is a lazy attempt to put some unneeded ooomph into an already fine movie premise, obviously trying to cash in one the body heat audience, the seeming results are undoubtedly aimed at a teen audience and to be sure, they are welcome to it. 4/10

danger: watch for falling spoilers...boy, was this a bad movie. i know that they were going for a "true love conquers all" kind of thing, but about all this film conquered was about 3(which felt more like 9) hours of my afternoon which i will never get back. the movie is about two young lovers named kai and gerta who live in a remote town in a fantasy world. kai is the much-abused bellboy at a hotel owned by gerta's father. at first gerta ignores kai's advances but she eventually warms up to him much to the disgust of (you guessed it!) gerta's father. as if this obstacle wasn't enough to overcome, an evil snow queen shoots a shard of glass in kai's eye and he becomes a mean person treats gerta poorly. kai is eventually taken to the snow queen's fortress (which is the same set as the hotel just covered in ice, because the good people at hallmark like to go all out) and gerta sets out on a mission to get kai back. along the way she runs into the 3 other seasons that are evil in their own special way, but gerta escapes them with the help of some dull and forgettable characters she meets along the way. (all the while you will want to turn it off, but can't force yourself to do it. it's probably the most evil and most effective spells cast by the snow queen) anyways, i will spare you from the ending because anything you can think up in your head right now is probably better then how they ended it. so, in conclusion, the snow queen is an incredibly boring movie, which takes the fan out of fantasy.

"the snow queen" is based on the famous and very beautiful fairytale by hans christian andersen, about a girl, gerda, who goes on a dangerous journey to rescue her friend kai from the clutches of the snow queen. this adaption attempts to capture that story's sense of adventure and luminously intricate imagery through lavish sets and production design, but fails on a number of counts.like so many hallmark productions, the potential of the story is completely undercut by heavy-handed scripting and direction. the two actors playing gerda and kai are blandly pleasant but forgettable; bridget fonda as the snow queen looks the part but is otherwise miscast for the role. there's a notable lack of dramatic tension to this meandering three-hour miniseries. at least some of the pacing problems can be attributed to the addition of filler scenes that add very little to the original story, particularly in the opening hour that introduces the main characters.that said, "the snow queen" would be just about ideal for pre-teens with a liking for fantasy and a bit of patience. it's great eye-candy without being scary, and the acting is pitched at the sort of pantomime over-the-top level that spells out the storyline in very, very bold text. just make sure you read them andersen's story too.

sometimes hallmark can get it right - like the 10th kingdom - but many of their fantasy films plod, and this falls into the latter category. the version i saw may have been cut (a demon [?] shown in the trailer and publicity stills didn't appear), but anything that made the movie shorter can only be a blessing.possible spoilers if you are unfamiliar with the original fairy tale:anyway, the film updates the story to the early part of the 20th century (?), and makes gerda and kay (here called kai - being a lexx fan, i kept expecting him to say, `the dead do not solve puzzles') 18 year olds. hans christian andersen's basic story is followed: the boy gets a shard of ice in his eye, goes bad, is taken off by the snow queen to solve a puzzle in her palace and gerda goes to find him, having various adventures on the way.as the two main characters are older than in the original, a lot of time is spent getting them together and `in love'. unfortunately, i was never convinced that they were particularly in love, and certainly not enough in love to make sense of gerda's quest. by the time the main plot kicks in, the movie's pace has slowed to a crawl. alas, when gerda begins her search for kai, it only manages to pick up the pace to a leisurely stroll.there are a few odd additions to the story that seem to go nowhere. at the start of the film the snow queen kills gerda's mother, but no explanation for this is given. a polar bear living in the snow queen's palace is more than he seems (though this is possibly because the producers realised that the bear's feelings towards the snow queen would be ok in a fairy tale, but not in a modern film). again, this is never explained. also, hints that the snow queen has an erotic desire for kai are dropped, but never followed through. the script is also full of anachronisms that really jar you out of the `fairy tale' mood.the production looks good, though there is evidence of penny-pinching: the snow queen's palace is the hotel where gerda and kai lived covered in ice. the three main characters are played with varying degrees of success: kai comes across as bland as does gerda initially, but once she sets off to find kai you warm to her. bridget fonda looks great as the snow queen, but seems to be in a different movie to everyone else.ultimately, the film is unsatisfying. it looks good, but drags and lacks magic.

this 3-hour made-for-tv miniseries came home with us from blockbuster's this weekend. the production company clearly spent a lot of money on sets, costuming (bridget fonda, especially), and special effects (including a great jim henson talking polar bear & reindeer). they should have spent a bit more money getting a coherent script. the story line was so loose that it really never came together. one can overlook irish-accented germans, but not herky-jerky storytelling. with senseless loose ends which included a special guest appearance by the devil, this one is certainly not destined to be a christmas classic. a shame that they wasted good performances by the two female leads.

for all intents and purposes, showtime was the worst movie i have ever seen.why? because having deniro in the cast adds immediate credibility and makes you want to watch the movie. i had also made the mistake of watching 48 hours and beverly hills cop recently before seeing showtime and for some strange reason thought eddie murphy was still funny. well he's not. in fact it almost seems like he has been neutered. as i watched this movie i was in amazement that deniro decided this was a good enough script to lend his name too. no chemistry between him and murphy whatsoever. horrible writing, horrible jokes, a movie that you think is supposed to be good can't get much worse than this. not too long after sitting through the wretch that was showtime i happened to watch national security starring martin lawrence. the movie had its funny parts but wasn't that great. but still it was 20 times better than showtime. please if your a deniro fan do not watch this movie!!

i don't understand jokes. i do believe this is my problem with modern cinema, or those films that are made with millions of dollars in hopes that it will become the next greatest sensation. isn't it odd  people just don't laugh as much anymore, and i do believe one of the diseases to that problem is the film "showtime". there was absolutely nothing, from the beginning to the end of the credits, with all of the bantering between murphy and de niro, with russo as eye candy, with even standard clichés which make the general population swoon with pre-programmed laughter, there was nothing in this film that made me laugh. there weren't the overbearing physical jokes or the calculated mental vocal jokes at all throughout this debacle of a film. from the beginning, i didn't buy the match-up of de niro and murphy as anything more than hollywood excitement, throughout the commentary the director vividly talks about the hijinks and laughter going on during the shoot  where was it in the film? this falls to either two problems  the director really doesn't have a sense of comedy or the editor didn't understand the value of the film. either way, they both doomed the entire hour and a half spent on the hollywood nightmare "showtime".outside of finding no reason to laugh, there was no reason to follow these characters through any moment of the film. there was a glimpse of humor with de niro's desire to pick up pottery as a hobby (but the director had to write kiln on the machine so audiences would understand  who does that?), but that was dropped and never developed. there was the idea that murphy was an actor, but outside of that one opening monologue, nobody would have understood that. he rents a room in a producer's house in which he can afford on a police officer's salary? this just didn't compute even for hollywood standards. there was a bad guy who wanted a big gun, but the gun was never developed, nor was there any true test of the weapons capability  even at the end. it became a bigger joke to laugh at an accent than remember the guns. where was the television show in this? russo had to get permission from this random guy at the beginning, but there were no consequences. there was nothing in the middle of this film outside of further questions and meaningless dribble. random characters were introduced, forgotten, re-introduced, and forgotten all over again. the director and producer laughed at this, while we, the meager viewer, must suffer through inside jokes and cliché stereotypes.was there a love interest in this film? was there a truly sinister bad guy that went apart from the comic duo to bring true evil to the screen? were there any pop culture references that didn't come back to robert de niro? was there random chaos throughout this film? if you need the answers to these, obviously, you won't find them in "showtime". the fact that i am riddling this review with question upon question, only means that this sub-par (actually, well below sub-sub-sub par) filled no quota or resembled anything of value to the cinematic world. sure, it had big names and one really neat explosion, but there was nothing of substance to this at all. it was almost as if the director said prior to the shoot that he wanted clichés, but not regular clichés  go with the bad ones. the plot had no linear structure. the jokes were boring. the characters were drab and underdeveloped. this ranks below even the best of "buddy-cop" films. i like to give films the benefit of the doubt, but nothing worked in this film. not even shatner could save this film, and he even tried hard.overall, i cannot, nor will i, suggest this film to anyone with a pulse. the commentary only confirms the pathetic nature of the film with obvious flaws, horrid jokes, and creators questioning the validity of their work. if creators can't stand behind "showtime", why should we? i didn't want a "lethal weapon" when i watched this, but i did want something like that. i understand there was some form of criticism of "reality television" and the corrupt nature of the media, but that message didn't make it off the page. in fact, i believe i saw "media" leave the theater first when i watched this. shame carries its heavy hand with this film and i cannot blame it. murphy used to be a big star, comedy was his middle name (see "coming to america"), but lately he seems to have lost his edge. de niro obviously wants to get away from an image that haunts him, but making these sort of films is only going to set him back further. one of these films is equal to one scorsese picture.skip this one. i promise, it will make your final cinematic days worthwhile. oh, and if you laughed at any of the jokes in this film  i am truly sorry! grade: * out of *****

bubbling just beneath the surface of showtime is a good idea. actually, it's more like two or three ideas that constantly fight for screentime. this film doesn't just have its cake and eat it too; it has the whole bakery.detective mitch preston (robert de niro) has a drug bust interrupted by the media and a brash, cop-slash-actor named trey sellars (eddie murphy). when preston's partner is shot, he angrily shoots the camera out of the hands of a pestering newsman, and the tiff lands him in a new reality cop show produced by chase renzi (rene russo). in the first of many errors and oddities in the movie, that injured partner is never heard from again or alluded to for the remainder of the film.de niro's best gag is his speech to a classroom of small children to open the picture about how tv cops don't act like real cops. funny thing is, as the movie progresses, his character and murphy's begin to act more and more like the clichés they supposedly clash so strongly with. in a smarter movie, de niro's diatribe could have played as ironic comment; here, it only shows to point out how truly lame the movie is. while a spoof of a reality based cop show could be funny, the team of writers and director tom dey (who made the far superior shanghai noon a few years ago; see that movie instead) seem to be on unsure footing, and instead of slamming the tv industry, they really let them off light (the harshest thing they seem to be able to say about network execs is they like to play ping pong at work). russo's character has a glint of fiendish delight in her eye, but her dialogue and actions rarely match the actress' enthusiasm. with little on screen to keep my attention, my mind began to wander, and that's dangerous in a movie with this many plot holes. for instance; if showtime (the name given to the cop show) is such a popular smash, why doesn't anyone seem to recognize de niro and murphy when they are on the job? for that matter, if their investigation of smuggler and all around mean guy vargas is being televised, why the heck hasn't someone mentioned to him that they are on his trail? then again, given this villain's actions maybe i shouldn't be surprised; this is the same joker who is very angry at an associate for using his new supergun without approval, jeopardizing a deal, and then dispatches him how? by using about ten of the superguns to level his entire house, of course! that's like putting out a fire with a bigger fire. occasionally, showtime gets laughs, but there simply aren't enough for the film's nearly two hour running time. even worse, the really smart gags suggest that this movie really could have been on to something, if only they had put in a few more drafts of the script. murphy mugs and talks as fast as he can with minimal results, and de niro looks flat out bored through most of this. after a completely unnecessary fistfight between cops and gangsters (that remarkably results in no injuries and no arrests) russo's character shouts `that's great television!' perhaps it's great television, but it's far from a great movie.

eddy murphy and robert de niro should be a combination that results in a great comedy. great expectationa often lead to dissapointment, and this proves to be the case.when eddy as a police officer spoils a drug deal being done by detective robert, they botch it so badly that they end up doing a live action reality tv cop show. logic is not a great component of this movie. the super-gun that they spend the second half of the movie chasing down confirms it. a twelve guage machine gun that leaves large holes in sheetmetal and three will destroy a house in about a minute (without reloading) is as more a fantasy than science fiction. a five pound gun, firing hundreds of shots per minute without any recoil, is certainly the weapon of the future using the technology of the past.it is clear this movie was designed for neither adults nor children, so if you are somewhere in between, this is the movie for you.

minor plot spoilers ahead!!!how did such talented actors get involved in such mindless retreadeddrivel? robert deniro plays a dumb hollywood version of the standardviolence prone tough cop (i.e., he beats up the bad guys and rolls hiseyes at cops who prefer to stick by the book), and eddie murphy plays anot so tough cop who would rather be an actor (i.e., he screams out,"freeze, police!" and has his "tough look" down pat). naturally, theyare partnered when bobby's loose cannon tactics get him in hot waterwith the media and he is essentially blackmailed into starring in a"cops"-like reality show. take a breath, cuz that's as funny as itgets.no energy was put into the script - it feels like a pale retread ofevery copy buddy movie tossed into a blender with "15 minutes" starring,yes, deniro himself as, pretty much the character he is playing here. the jokes fall flat, the action feels listless, and no one seems to behaving a good time. it's dead on the screen.please don't waste your time. even if you have an overwheming affinityfor one of the actors - avoid it and do them a favor. becauze if thismakes money, these kinda of scripts will be deeemed perfectly acceptablefor actors of their quality.and to mr. deniro. you used to make serious films. i remember them -they were good. you were nominated for awards for them - remember howmuch fun that was? now after "analyze this" (which was good), "meet theparents" (which was also good), and "the adventures of rocky andbullwinkle" (which was not good), i think we need to see you parodyingyourself less, and being yourself more. "casino" feels like a long timeago. and no, i don't count "15 minutes" as serious bobby. anyone whotook that media satire seriously must get their weekly world news

there comes a time in every big name actor's career when they get sloppy and accept projects that they wouldn't have touched with a 1000 ft. pole in their golden days. remember "taxi driver"? that was a fine film. i can hardly believe that the de niro of "showtime" is the same actor.i would rather watch "time chasers" twice than see this film again. if anyone offers to take you to see "showtime" or gives you free passes, or whatever, run away as fast and far as you can.

the movie is not as funny as the director's preceding (and only other) movie, shanghai noon. showtime did have its moments, but it did not satisfy me. why it needed to be so foulmouthed, i don't know, but i give showtime **/****

with all the hype surrounding the stars of the movie, this movie left me wanting. i expected a much better movie considering the inclusion of the talents of murphy, de niro and russo but found that the movie fell flat on it's face. comedy sequences were overdone and the superior performances of the stars especially de niro and russo couldn't save this one!** out of *****

two popular actors are paired in showtime like de niro and murphy playing a police and an actor. although they share the most screen time together, they do not reach their expected performances such films like analyse this, meet the parents, dr doolittle and nutty professor. the film starts interestingly but becomes a thin, ordinary comedy which is quite disappointing.it feels like especially de niro doesn't enjoy being in showtime. thats a shame because he really shows his feelings thats what i think. unfortunately, if the idea had been used cleverly this could have been a more interesting piece of work and could be followed with a sequel like any other popular hollywood movie. well, i don't think there would be a sequel to this at least casting de niro and murpy again. ** out of *****

watching showtime i got the impression that the producers got the idea to put robert deniro and eddie murphy just for the sake of having a film that co-starred the two of them. other than that i can't think of a reason to justify the film's existence. not that it isn't amusing in spots, it certainly is, but the concept is so completely ludicrous that the laughs are somewhat muted.the thing that really got me was eddie murphy's character. i can't seem to wrap my mind around the concept of someone being a police officer as strictly a day job. when i was working person at new york state crime victims board i had to deal with all kinds of cops and they ran the gamut between the really dedicated and some real slugs, but i can't think of one who thought that this was just something i do until i get my career going in an area far afield. i mean, can you really see eddie murphy or anyone else going through the rigors of the real police academy, not the screen version, just to get a day job?anyway deniro is your basic hard working detective who's on the trail of a major gun dealer. he's undercover and murphy is part of his backup. so what does the showboating murphy do, he calls a reality based tv series like cops to film the action. so deniro's bust gets blown sky high, but the producer of the show gets some good footage of murphy and deniro and decides on a new reality based television series. so these unwilling partners get joined and try to continue working deniro's case with all the tv cameras around.eddie murphy's a funny guy, i loved him in beverly hills cop and in the doctor doolittle movies, but he's done better things than showtime and robert deniro certainly has. i guess murphy wanted a chance to work with deniro and deniro must have gotten one hefty paycheck to do this film.

i put down this vehicle from robert de niro and eddie murphy, and murphy in particular the first time but having seen it again, recently, i can see that it does have some very funny bits.this is by no means to say that this is the greatest buddy comedy of all time, but really what can you do to the already exhausted subgenre? what director, tom dey, has tried to do is make it a satire of the clichés of buddy comedy and the media. early in the movie the executive of a cable network asks: "how is this different from cops?", when chase renzi is pitching the idea of a reality show dealing with de niro's character, mitch preston (hilariously boring name by the way). that's when i saw it in a new light that i hadn't previously noticed.the idea is to show all the elements of the buddy comedy and put a twist on them. de niro's reluctance to star in the show and to partner up with murphy is right out of every cop film you can think of. you can say that de niro is actually playing himself asking: "why would i do another movie playing a cop?" chase renzi is portrayed to be a hollywood phony but if you look at her opening scene again, she is merely doing it to save her job. she somehow sees the ridiculousness of what she is doing but she wants to succeed despite that. one line says it all: "who doesn't want to be on tv?" maybe this is reading too much into what is essentially a lightweight film, merely set to entertain, but it does give it a little spin that i hadn't noticed before.as for murphy. you got to applaud him for looking this ridiculous. trey wants to be a star so bad that he is willing to sell out everything he comes in contact with. murphy was a big star and maybe it struck a nerve that it is all so fleeting.the plot with the gun is of course pretty boring. the action sequences are nothing special, except the end which required a lot of effort both from cast and crew. one thing that i noticed about the villain is that he is dressed like an 80's pop star. george michael comes to mind and that adds to the whole media spin.so, i trashed it the first time around but what the heck; if you are gonna do this, why not point out how ridiculous it really is and de niro and murphy took a big chance doing this.

the name of this film and the clips that i saw caused me to believe that this film would have excitement and interesting moments. i was disappointed. the desert sands were interesting but this film inched along at a snails pace. it started fine with an underground cave and something coming out but then tried to involve us with the lives of some very unlikeable human beings. as they found dead bodies, or should i say, skeletons with some flesh on them, they began a search for the reason why? at times it became somewhat different as something was following them in the desert. some type of black ooze or something that would begin to eat the flesh of humans. as the flesh was munched upon, a bag of bones began to creep after the remaining humans. the reason for this black ooze as we find out was pretty bad, ants? unbelieveable! then the ending made no sense. i guess the motto of this film will be, when you have an itch and see an ant, quickly kill it before the ant's friends smell your flesh.

no really, im not kidding around here folks, and i so cant believe how many people here have given it really really positive reviews! oh wait, its the imdb comments section, silly me. its interesting to note that at this date, there have not been enough votes to give this film a rating out of ten, yet there are dozens of comments that rave about the film. what does this mean i wonder? anyway, the script is terrible. character change their personality and motivation and actions every scene, in order to keep the movie running along at something that vaguely resembled a pace. it wasnt even dumb behaviour, that was there too, but the pure idiocy of the script transcended any dumbness the characters displayed. for instance: karl is disobeying an order because there are two dead bodies in the desert and "the killer is out here somewhere" so he forces everyone to travel 40kms in order to find the killer, disobeying orders and p*ssing everyone off. when the hero spots something nasty in the darkness and warns karl, karl tells our hero to stop being an idiot and that there's nothing out there so they are all going home. next scene, he is refusing to let it go and must hunt down whatever it is. it is just a joke. yes, the monster is very impressive, but the crap that the humans say about it just tries to cancel out its interesting aspects, and the predator and alien rip off moments were very tedious. and the ending...the ending!?!?! jesus....the worst film i saw the year, and i saw bug buster!

this horror tale takes place in the namib desert of africa. a canadian systems analyst, zach straker(scott bairstow)is sent on an assignment for a diamond mining company. although he hates field work, he finds himself in a truck with a rescue unit in the open desert fighting sand flies and whipping, blowing sand. four diamond prospectors are found...well whats left of their scattered bones are discovered. during a long cold desert night a shape-shifting monster makes its appearance. zach and his colleagues are terrified when their truck is stranded and members of the unit are dying horribly one by one. there is no character development; let alone dialogue to speak of. the desert set in its own way is beautiful and without giving anything away... the creature is as old as the desert sands. also in the cast are: rachel shelley, warrick grier and patrick shai.

***spoilers*** ***spoilers*** some bunch of afrikkaner-hillbilly types are out in the desert looking for diamonds when they find a hard mound in the middle of a sandy desert area. spoilers: the dumbest one starts hitting the mound with a pick, and cracks it open. then he looks into the hole and sticks his head in and surprise! something eats him. the other two dimwits are not seen alive again. scott bairstow looks like a pizza delivery boy but he plays some kind of expert scientist with a medical degree (which means he should be about 35 years old, minimum). bairstow is supposed to join camp c and help them find diamonds. the truck that picks up bairstow to take him to camp c has a handful of the kind of weirdoes that usually populate movies like "pitch black" "the thing" etc. the truck happens to drive across the first truck and they decide to investigate (how come that truck did not see the other truck when they were driving to pick up bairstow, since they were travelling the same road??). so they find the eaten bodies, and there are some decent special effects relating to bones with little bits of flesh on them. the main lunatic in the group, karl, decides that they must find the killer. so the truck drives around in the desert following some tracks, and eventually it has an electrical short and the crew is stuck in the desert. the dumbest guy in this group had picked up a bunch of bones using his jacket to carry them around. when he takes a nap (wearing the same jacket) the creatures eat him alive, and another guy runs over and sticks his arm into the goo and that dummy loses his arm too. sounds exciting so far, except that a few minutes later, dr. bairstow realizes that the creature is really hundreds of thousands of ants who are using the bones to hold each other together so they can travel to a new hive (because the miners cracked open the old hive). now, last time i checked, ants could move around on their own, without having to kill people in order to use the bones for structure. if all they need was something hard, they could have put a bunch of sticks together and used those to create a form. the whole story is really, really dumb, and the ant explanation is the only one given. the rest of the movie is just about the group getting killed off until they find the new ant-nest, and kill the ant-brain (sort-of), and the hundreds of thousands of ants then walk away on their own itty-bitty feet. there is a spare ant-brain found (off-camera) and sent back for analysis thus creating a reason for a sequel.

when i saw the poster at the theater, i thought that it is a "new line" of a horror story without a famous cast worth giving a try. but, after i went in, i wanted to leave after 20 minutes. there was a lot of non-sense and logical flaws. to me, it is a movie that is not worth putting in theaters. it is not even worth seeing.

i wasted 5 dollars renting this complete piece of crap. dr. zack is the most unlovable lead character i have ever seen. the movie was full of every cliche you could ever think of and contained not a single ounce of originality. there was the typical sexism portrayed by rugged foreigners, all the guys had those 'too-proud to take advice' attitudes that are as stale as grandma's christmas fruitcake. the concept and deaths were really cool, but they lose all novelty once the monster is revealed. (read the spoiler at the end) nothing else is really revealed though, the ending is the biggest cop-out you've ever seen. i predicted everything before it happened, including who would die and how. the dialogue is lacking, and that's an understatement by far. there's mostly just random yelling, thoughtful staring, and chunky sentences. the actors are just god awful! i don't want to talk about this movie anymore, it's making me angry. i just wonder if the director even watched it when it was done.(spoiler alert!!!! save 5 dollars!) the monster is just a bunch of ants that "evolved" so now they need bones so they can move around, (nevermind the fact that this serves no evolutionary advantage whatsoever, and that the ants just killed whoever was available, though the movie acts like they kill out of necessity. this movie made me dumber.) the end consists of the lead idiot killing the mother ant (a big blob thing) which destroys all the other ants. pretty cliche eh? he almost wusses out at the end because of a sudden emotional attachment to the mother-thing that overcomes him. give me a break.

i gave this movie 2 instead of 1 just just because i am a polite person. this movie made me loose 90 minutes of my life in which i could have done something useful for the human kind or just me. the dialog is poor, the actors never look scared! even if it's supposed to be a horror movie. for example the scene in which kurt collects the bones of his former colleague. he should be frightened, but he looks quite normal. the chick of the movie is such a cliché. the one thing i liked about her is the dress she wore in the final scene.and, by the way, the end was extremely predictable with the cocoon blinking pinkly in the box. as a matter of fact, i was thinking more of an ant walking around on the back seat of the car. but it still didn't surprise me.

i watched "deadly voyage" because david suchet was in it, after enjoying him in the "poirot" series. and joss ackland is always worth watching, so i went into the film with an expectation of it being a potentially worthwhile film. alas, it was not to be.i won't bother critiquing the performances, the pacing, the cinematography or any other structural aspect of the film; others here have already given their opinions on those elements. the only thing i want to address is the film's message, since it proclaims in the intro that it's based upon a true story, and therein hangs the film's supposed importance."deadly voyage" primarily focuses upon an impoverished black african man named kingsley who wants to move to the us, because he believes that he can make money there. nothing more, nothing less -- his motivation is utterly selfish. (of course some people will prevaricate by saying that he was doing it for his family, but in fact he decided to have children on the income he could make in ghana, so he really just created his own problem.) to that end, kingsley decides to stow-away aboard a russian freighter bound for new york. in the process of doing this, he faces harsh conditions, racist crew members and other challenges.but this is precisely where the film leaves me unsympathetic. why should the audience be expected to care about kingsley? simply because he has a goal? goals aren't such a rare commodity that his should be privileged above say, the goal of the ship's captain or the woman he left at home with his newborn child. kingsley's goal is illegal in the eyes of the us government. it is also illegal in that it steals from the russian shipping company. if he makes it to the us, it would involve taking out of a system that he has not put into. and if he gets caught, the shipping company will be fined $45,000. i doubt very much that any of the stowaways care about what their chosen course of action is costing anyone else; they're clearly just out for their own gain. he could've spent the $1,000 he won in the lottery at the beginning of the film, for legal passage to the us, and applied for residency and a work permit. instead, he takes the illegal (and dangerous) route.so since kingsley's voyage is illegal, selfish and cannot be ethically justified, why should we care about him or his ordeal? simply because he faces challenges? why should his challenges be privileged above the challenge of the russian shipping company getting to new york without stowaways? because he's black and the shipping company is white? the reason seems to be because danny glover (the film's executive producer) and others involved want us to root for kingsley, as if he's a hero on some sort of noble voyage. but once you accept that illegal immigration, theft and a fool's mission aren't noble at all, you can't really care about him.before anyone plays the race card, i assure you that i would've felt the same no matter what ethnicity/nationality the involved parties were. imagine if a british person decided to stow-away in a train headed for bhutan, sneak across the border, and collect "unwanted" buddhist antiquities, to bring back to britain to sell. how much sympathy could the challenges he faced generate? very little, i'd bet. so why should we feel different for kingley? because he's black? because he's poor by american standards? the filmmakers are banking on us sharing their views that the ends justify the means, and that a shipping company being fined $45,000 is inconsequential compared to the remote possibility of an unskilled laborer earning slightly more in the us than he could've if he had just stayed in his own home country. i didn't buy it for a minute.

this is another alien imitation and not a very good one at that.replace outer space with the south african desert,throw in the same ingredients,a group of people stranded in an inhospitable landscape, have them hunted down by an alien creature and you have the same old story of a very ordinary film trying to ape a classic film. a group of miners and scientists go on a hunt for some missing colleagues and find their bones in the desert stripped clean of flesh.their vehicle breaks down and they head for civilisation while being stalked by the monster. the african location is pretty enough but that is basically all this film has going for it. there is a vain attempt to build up the tension but i found this didn't really work and made the film rather boring.the creature didn't appear much and when it did it didn't really install a feeling of horror.there is one scene where someone gets the flesh ripped from his arm but that was basically it on the gore front. in conclusion i found this film about as exciting as watching paint dry.i give this film 4/10 and that is only because of the interesting location which alone isn't enough to save this movie from being a total snooze-fest

the bone snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the namib desert. when the find them, they are nothing more than bones stripped clean and they could not have been dead for more than six hours. the story keeps you interested as to what exactly caused this. the characters are well enough, and the acting is pretty good.about an hour and ten minutes in when you find out what is causing the bones to be stripped clean, you sigh "oh, that is really stupid." the movie is ruined by bad writing and a non-exciting ending. up until that point, the movie was pretty good, and it is a shame that it took such a bad turn. so i cannot recommend this movie. i gave it a 4/10.

i'm working my way through the horror classics 50 movie pack collection and the mad monster is one of the movies in the set.i am sure that george zucco was a good actor; but, this was only the second film in which i saw him, the first being dead men walk, in which he played two parts. however, even good acting couldn't save the mad monster.zucco plays a mad scientist, dr. cameron (who was banned from academia because of his unethical and inhumane experiments). he believes that he can control evolution by bringing out the characteristics of one animal into another.in this case, like so many others of its ilk, it is a transfusion of (i assume) wolf's blood into humans. his goal is to create an invincible army, which he can control through the antidote. the subject of his experiments is his hired hand, a retarded gardener, whose dialogue slows down this snail-paced classic to almost a full-stop. beyond his experiments, dr. cameron also plots revenge on those who discredited him, using his transformed gardener. however, he loses control of his subject, who begins to transform without the transfusion -- yikes! the werewolf transformations are classic hollywood stop-action / makeup effects. no doubt these were groundbreaking techniques of the time; but, in today's digital age it's hard to imagine audiences being scared by this.

a paranoid scientist creates a wolfman by transfusing wolf blood into a meek, quiet, but very large gardener, in order to prove an hypothesis. so the gardener begins nightly rampages and the scientist tries to use him to reclaim his credentials, but is rebuffed by his former colleagues for tampering with nature. island of dr moreau, frankenstein and various wolfman films all blended together into a terribly dated, goofy, morality play.though the subject matter is pedantic and unoriginal at best, this film is not too poorly made, and interesting to watch as a representative of horror film making of its time. like most mad scientist films, this is a weak warning against fooling around with mother nature. it doesn't have the power or intellectual challenges of frankenstein, but it doesn't ever extend its reach anyway. the acting is passable, as is the cinematography, and the film moves along at an entertaining clip. some of the dialog is utterly ludicrous, but hey... it's just a movie - and a b minus one at that. there are also a few nice shots of a wolf, and a smattering of humor tossed-in to prevent the film from appearing to take itself too seriously - always a plus for this genre.

this has got to be the most god-awful piece of cinematic crap i have ever watched. it makes mel brooks movies oscar-worthy by comparison. jim vanbebber needs to be publicly slapped for trying to pass this off as any form of entertainment.while some may say that this movie is true to the low budget genre of such classics as "the texas chainsaw massacre" or "night of the living dead", the production value is not in question. it is vanbebber's ability to cast and present a plausible story line. the casting is deplorable. for the role of charlie he must have picked the first actor he saw with a beard and long hair. never mind that this actor's hair came halfway down his back, (manson's never went much past his shoulders) this actor spoke in a dreadful monotone without so much as a fraction of the personality that steve railsback or even jeremy davies lent to their portrayals of manson. the actor chosen to play "tex" watson had curly blond hair instead of straight dark hair, a fact that anyone who has shown even the most remote interest in the manson case knows. he looks like a minnesota farmer on "little house on the prairie" the actress playing susan atkins has a butt wider than oprah's, while those familiar with the family members know that "clem" was considered somewhat retarded, the actor portraying him did so in such a campy, chaplinesque way it was like watching an old vaudevile act. instead of sharon tate looking like a beautiful pregnant woman, the actress looked like bloated, alcoholic trailer trash. vanbebber speeds up the filming in some places for artistic effect yet this technique hasn't proved remotely useful since "the munsters". the end credits list every known family member yet we are never introduced to the majority of them and those we are introduced to we aren't sure who they are sometimes.facts are destroyed in this movie as well. "lotsapoppa" did not die in real life, steven parent was shot four times, not twice, abagail folger did not have her throat slit, where were mary brunner and bruce davis during the himnan murder? patricia krenwinkel never sported a "dorothy hamill" hair style.the most baffling aspect of this movie is what the modern day "freaks" had to do with this movie? why was the girl wearing a rubber mask with a dildo attached? what was their problem with the journalist? what was the meaning or purpose of the final confrontation? why were they included, period? the viewer never knows! holy mackerel, i could go on and on but space prevents it. don't try to eat popcorn during this garbage because your hand will be too busy scratching your head while you repeatedly say "what the f---?"

i heard legends about this "film" (quotes used so as not to insult films) for a while, so when i finally got the dvd with it, i impatiently started watching it. by the end, i *had* to fast forward through just a few of the most moronic, ineptly made, nonsensical scenes of this pointless childish mess to make it end quicker.this may be the worst film i've even "touched" - and i used to be associated with troma for a while. "manson family" makes the bottom of troma's entries look like daring and groundbreaking art-house filmwork. i could go on and talk about the syphilitic skeleton of a "plot" it has, the revoltingly bad "acting", the painful, inept "directing", the sets and props with their "dollar ninety nine" look (i especially "loved" the plastic toy guns used in the tate murder scene!) or the nauseating look and feel of this whole bag of garbage (i think it was supposed to represent a drug-induced hallucination; i have absolutely no idea how a drug-induced hallucination looks or feels, nor do i want to find out - but i guess drug junkies with burned out "brains" will love this "film" (they seem to be the ones who made it) i've seen many films from various "worst 50" lists, traditionally opened by eddie wood's ones - and eddie wood would be appalled by the sheer ineptitude and talentless of van webber (or whatever his name is; i certainly don't want to remember it) i've never seen "superbabies" or its sequel, but i strongly wish that "manson" joined them on imdb's rating. fortunately, this obscure garbage probably won't be seen by enough viewers to warrant it sufficiently many "1" votes - and so much the better!

i got encouraged to watch this film because i've heard good word of it: it was supposed to be this thrilling true crime milestone, disturbing, shocking... all that jazz. well, i am disturbed because i spent money on it, and i am shocked that something so god-awful actually got released. that's about it.this is a supposed "new look" at charles manson's family of insane loser junkies and their murders. but if this is a "new look" then it's probably "new" as in "fresh and totally inept": just watching it gave me a headache and i had to give up trying to make any sense of it or even understand just what the director intended it to be.i suppose i should say something about the plot but fact is, it was so stupid and incoherent that i barely remember if there even was a plot at all. there was something about a "manson tape" delivered to a radio dj (or a tv producer?), then an hour of pointless random footage of "the family" in '69, then the polanski murders (looking like a bad school play) and finally some idiotic part about a bunch of skinheads getting drunk and beating the hell out of one another in an alley (i kid you not), and then it ended (thank god) (don't ask me to make any sense of that, i'm just recalling what i saw!) the performances were terrible, too. and how difficult is it to make a convincing "manson"? get a short skinny scrawny bloke, put a dirty wig and a shaggy beard on him. there's your manson. but this "manson" doesn't even look right. he just looks like, uh, a bloke in a cheap wig and a glued on santa beard painted black.or maybe that's what this film is actually about: manson's family didn't make any sense, so this film doesn't make any sense, either. it's symbolic! (yeah, right) i'm still so angry at spending money on this i stopped my normal lurking on this site and registered just to vote 1 for this film and post this warning that will hopefully prevent others from spending their money on this garbage. stay away from it, it's not even worth renting.ps. the recent us tv production "helter skelter" got bad reviews here but i saw it last month (i saw the 1976 original too) and let me tell you, compared to "manson family", that new helter skelter is brilliant and flawless. and i was disappointed in it! that's how bad "manson family" is: it makes a flawed and mostly disappointing tv movie look perfect.

the only thing of interest about this movie is its subject matter. taking a look at the manson "family" from the point of view of the family members themselves is a great idea. however, trying to make sense of the uncomprehensible is something that can really only be accomplished in a masterwork -- and this ain't it.presumably because there was so much information to squeeze into a screenplay, this film was done in a faux documentary style, with reenactments thrown in. trouble is, the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable, like character, story, theme and so on.worse, there's an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter-day mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings. it's dumb and pointless, and a complete waste of time.all in all, this movie is one big wasted opportunity. the one ray of sunshine is the acting of marc pitman, who plays tex, who in real life did most of the actual killing. whereas the female characters come off as giggly airheads in the 60s flashbacks, pitman manages to convey real feeling.in short, don't bother with this movie.

okay, last night, august 18th, 2004, i had the distinct displeasure of meeting mr. van bebble at a showing of the film the manson family at the three penny in chicago as part of the chicago underground film festival. here's what i have to say about it. first of all, the film is an obvious rip off of every kenneth anger, roman polanski, oliver stone and terry gilliam movie i've ever seen. second of all, in a short q & a session after the show mr. van bebble immediately stated that he never made any contact with the actual manson family members or charlie himself, calling them liars and saying he wanted nothing to do with them, that the film was based on his (van bebble's) take on the trial having seen it all from his living room on tv and in the news (and i'm assuming from the autobiography and the book helter skelter which were directly mimicked through the narrative). so i had second dibs on questions, i asked if he was trying to present the outsider, mtv, sex drugs and rock 'n roll version and not necessarily the true story. this question obviously pissed off the by now sloshed director who started shouting "f*** you, shut the f*** up, this is the truth! all those other movies are bullsh**!"well anyway, i didn't even think about how ridiculous this was until the next day when i read the tagline for the film, "you've heard the laws side of the story...now hear the story as it is told by the manson family." excuse me, if this guy has never even spoken to the family and considers them to be liars that he doesn't want to have anything to do with, how in god's name can he tell the story for them!? this is the most ridiculous statement i have ever heard! the film was obviously catered to the sex drugs and rock 'n roll audience that it had no trouble in attracting to the small, dimly lit theatre, and was even more obviously spawned by the sex drugs and rock 'n roll mind of a man who couldn't even watch his own film without getting up every ten minutes to go get more beer or to shout some sort of rocky horroresque call line to the actors on screen. this film accomplishes little more than warping the public's image of actual events (which helped shape the state of america and much of the world today) into some sort of slasher/comic book/porno/rape fantasy dreamed up by an obviously shallow individual.the film was definitely very impressive to look at. the soundtrack was refreshing as it contained actual samples of charlie's work with the family off of his lie album. the editing was nice and choppy to simulate the nauseating uncertainty of most modern music videos. all in all this film would have made a much better addition to the catalogues at mtv than to the underground film festival or for that matter the minds of any intellectual observers. i felt like i was at a midnight rocky horror viewing the way the audience was dressed and behaving (probably the best part of the experience). the cast was very good with the exception of charlie who resembled some sort of stoned dungeons and dragons enthusiast more than the actual role he was portraying. the descriptions the film gave of him as full of energy, throwing ten things at you and being very physical about it all the while did not match at all the slow, lethargic, and chubby representation that was actually presented.all in all the film basically explains itself as sadie (or maybe it was linda) declares at the end, "you can write a bunch of bullsh** books or make a bunch of bullsh** movies...etc. etc." case in point. even the disclaimer "based on a true story" is a dead giveaway, signalling that somewhere beneath this psychedelic garbage heap lay the foundation of an actual story with content that will make and has made a difference in the world. all you have to do is a little bit of alchemy to separate the truth from the the crap, or actually, maybe you could just avoid it all together and go read a book instead.all i can say is this, when the film ended i got a free beer so i'm glad i went, but not so glad i spent fifteen dollars on my ticket to be told to shut the f*** up for asking the director a question. peace.

strikes me as routine, as far as tv movies go. i can believe that it's based on a true story because the plot seems too clumsy to have been written by anyone with storytelling skills.for instance, good old john ritter (now a rather bulky and bearded villain) poisons his wife enough to make her ill, then accuses her of being psychosomatic and leaves to marry another young woman immediately. fourteen years pass before the story picks up again. why fourteen years? i would guess that though the narrative doesn't demand it, history does.some of the particular scenes, however, are so cinematically apt that they were almost certainly dreamed up by a writer. pawing through her attic, helgenberger, ritter's first wife, stumbles across an old electrical appliance and has one of those black-and-white flashbacks with stings on the score -- suddenly she recalls when, fourteen years ago, she discovered ritter shaving selenium filings from a rectifier, carefully collecting them, and putting them in her shampoo and her eyelash liner (or whatever it's called). later it develops that he was putting it into her coffee as well.frankly, i don't believe it. i don't believe either that she had that particular epiphany in the attic or that ritter put selenium shavings into her shampoo or eyeliner. selenium is referred to in the movie as a "toxic metal" and i suppose it is, in sufficient quantity, but it's also an anti-oxidant that's sold over the counter in drug stores and swallowed. someone will have to demonstrate -- as no one does in this movie -- that it is a topical poison. many people have tried the nicotine patch and failed. so how come some selenium in her shampoo gives marg helgenberger immediate and drastic headaches? and her eyes become as painful as boils when she applies makeup? i think the anthropologist e. b. tylor called this simple-minded idea "sympathetic magic," but i'm not sure.mais je divage. anyway ritter evidently tries the same stunt with his second wife fourteen years later, although no evidence of trickery is ever produced when she becomes ill with the same symptoms. wife number two is taken to mexico and apparently cured but suddenly drops dead shortly after her return. circumstantial evidence piles up against ritter, who plays the villain with all the stops out -- when his first trial is dismissed he smirks at helgenberger, who has prompted the investigation.you see, helgenberger was good friends with ritter's second wife and was terribly disturbed at her demise and its manner. (i'll bet.) and she wants to prevent the same thing from happening to the wealthy young woman who seems lined up for third place in ritter's marital schedule. (sure.) the best performance is given by the guy who plays detective mauser -- lawrence dane? everyone else acts by the numbers. they project emotions and thoughts with the subtlety of a warning at a railroad crossing. but dane does little things that are original. "i'm told you want to report a murder. (long pause while he sits down and waits), then abruptly thrusts his face towards helgeberger and inquires in a reasonable and curious voice, "so who was murdered"? i suppose except for the bare bones of the historical events, nothing prevented characters or their actions from being drawn differently than they were in real life. i mean, what the heck, ritter is still in jail convicted of murder and helgenberger's character is dead, so who is to object? i wish the forensic stuff had been made clearer. ritter seems to have used so many poisons and toxic metals -- let me see, selenium, cyanide, a massive dose of chlorine, and maybe something else -- that i was confused by it all. not that i was rooting for ritter. here's a mathematician with a ph.d. who insists people call him "doctor." he even corrects people who address him merely as "professor." most ph.d.s get that narcissistic problem behind them very quickly. "jes' call me whitey, even though i know how to get a standard deviation and you don't." average tv fare.
