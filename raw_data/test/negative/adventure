i was disappointed with the third film in the "death wish" series and wouldn't recommend this unless you are really into bronson. he is his usual self in this one, maybe a bit lighter hearted than in the others; the rest of the cast is good if your watching a movie of the week on t.v. - the whole film has the production value of a bad episode of the a-team and i like the escapism fun of a show like the a-team but not on the big screen, even if it is an action movie that doesn't claim to be anything to sophisticated. the film takes a while to get going and then when it finally does, it gets out of control to the point of ridiculousness. the plot is something out of an episode of "highway to heaven" and bronson seems like a fish out of water with the majority senior citizen cast and the gun play is so out of control you don't even get any satisfaction from bronson's revenge against the bad guys. skip this and go on to the 4th installment which i highly recommend.

this movie could very well have been a propaganda movie for the north americian falangist party - or some similar group... the strong man (kersey) places himself above the law (but not outside the law) and liberates upstanding citizens by killing worthless trash. the only thing that made me think it wasn't made by the kkk was the fact that a jew starred as a good guy... try watching it again while thinking of it as a propaganda movie for an extreme right wing group - and you'll see what i mean...it's a tragedy that jimmy page actually made music for this movie... :(

this movie lacked credibility for two reasons. one, no mayor of a major city, and new york is certainly as major as it gets. would allow a borough in his city to degenerate into such a violent place to live; especially for voters who could have much to say about his or her future job security. all of the victims in the movie were mostly elderly, jewish or defenseless. at 62-years of age, i have never seen a movie that depicted such utter lack of respect for authority as this movie did. even "escape from new york," which was fictional, up front, i.e. they told you that this was science fiction, didn't resort to such deep-seated violence. in this movie, most of the elderly victims were victimized and yet had guns but were unwilling to use them. also, in this movie and i have not seen the prior two, is more lawless than the "escape" movie. secondly, gangs as far as my research shows have never been as cooperative as this movie makes them out to be. on the one hand they catch a gang member from another gang working in their area and he's killed. yet when the heroes start shooting at the local gang bangers, the next gang over is welcomed with open arms. outside gang members are always viewed as outsiders and are stopped. we are supposed to believe that when automatic weapons are used against our gang, the other gangs want to be all into it. why did the outside gangs come to help? i believe that more than one gang from outside came to help. what did they come for? another question, why was the gang leader in jail and why do fellow jail inmates ask his permission to attack bronson's character? this was not a great movie and i could go on, but i won't.

this is slightly less sickening than the first two films, but otherwise it's business as usual: a scuzzy, sleazy and unbalanced slice of diseased cinema. charles bronson is back, blasting into action when his friend is killed by yobs terrorising the neighbourhood. crime, you see, is up 11% in the south belmont area... so what's to be done? a stronger police presence? tougher jails? harsher sentences? nope, the only solution is to send in a loose cannon like bronson to mete out bloodthirsty revenge  or, as the writers would have it, justice: this time he's the personal killing machine of police chief ed lauter.the writers bend over backwards to make kersey the hero, sending the useless cops into the area only to confiscate a weapon from an elderly resident who keeps it for protection, and supplying a scene in which kersey has his camera stolen and shoots the thief right in the back, to applause from the watching crowd. capital punishment for theft? well, okay. the attitude of everyone in the film is that this is a solution, and the dishonest twisting of the characters into ciphers who exist only to cheer kersey on or back him up is appalling.sure, these villains are scum, but shouldn't the film leave the audience to make up its mind, rather than slanting the entire thing towards kersey and his mindless answer? funnily enough the beleaguered residents don't fear gang reprisals or blame kersey for any of the violence, which is odd as one character is killed precisely because of kersey's involvement. at the end of the film they all take guns from their sock drawers and gleefully join in with the massacre, never stopping to think things through or struggle with the thought of having to kill another human being.the atrociously shallow performances don't help  bronson has literally one facial expression throughout and can't even put inflection on the right words. new heights of stupidity are reached here  a machine gun? a rocket launcher?!  and new lows of misogyny: the movie contrives to desecrate every female character in sight, whether by rape, explosion or throat-slashing; and it sets them up in supremely stupid fashion, like one victim who ventures into the crime-ridden, gang-controlled neighbourhood to ask out a stranger, or another who goes shopping alone at night. this is dreck, pure and simple, mindless garbage put together without style or sense.

"death wish 3" is the movie equivalent of a shooting gallery. all the characters (apart from bronson's paul kersey, of course) exist merely to be killed, either as "provocation" (the good guys) or as "retribution" (the villains). the director simply pours on the mindless violence (people even get burned alive and blown up), turning this into an urban version of "commando" (and charlie, like arnold, rarely bothers to protect himself from the enemy gunfire). fans of this short of thing (and, apparently, there are many) will enjoy it, others....beware. (*1/2)

ok, i just flipped channels and caught dw3. i watched it knowing it would be trash..but..as a person who has seen tons of films, this one stands up there as one of the most purely bad films i have ever seen...i'm not kidding. it is so bad you have to watch it, like a bad accident you can't turn away from. sometimes these kinds of films work, ie, troma movies...but watching martin balsam and charles bronson slum it up like this is painful....what's even funnier is i pulled up imdb to see what other people said and it actually scores a 4.1/10??? i can't believe it made it past 1.5! equally as funny is this is not even the pinnacle of this series...somehow this garbage warranted part 4 and 5? and to top it all off, some dude's comments on here referenced this as the best of the series and his favorite film of all time??? statements like that scare me about this world!

naked deanna troi! richie's brother chuck (from "happy days") with a reverse mohawk!death wish 3 has all this and more, including one clever scene where chuck bronson's character sets up a mousetrap like device that brains a punk when he opens the window.chuck also places a board with a bunch of nails on the floor near another window and smiles when he returns and sees bloody footprints leading away.all i can say about death wish 3 is that it is one of most incomprehensible "serious" movies that i have ever seen--loaded to the hilt with mayhem, and nearly zero police response, despite the use of military weapons to mow punks down by the score.as i understand it, bronson disowned this film, but happily cashed the check from golan globus.if you enjoy quality movies, avoid this one, but if you're in for a cheap "jackass" kind of thrill, check it out.

the 3rd in the series finds paul kersey (bronson) turning vigilante to get revenge on the thugs that murdered his old buddy. i don't know why this movie shoved me into it, but somehow it did. i found myself rooting for bronson to wipe the floor with those punks. every time he blew one of them away i felt good. this movie does not take itself seriously, but what if it did? there is a good build-up to the fireworks finale in which bronson goes on a rampage. but as far as acting and plot go, it just doesn't measure up. if i lived in that neighborhood, i would get out as fast as i could, but it seems like the people are asking for trouble. i know there is that mentality that we need to save our streets, but there is a limit here folks. i had to give it a 4. sure there are good "blow 'em away" scenes but that's about it. at that time, bronson was 64. i'm sure if those thugs really wanted to they could have their way with bronson. bronson takes the place of a schwarzanegger or stallone in this movie. this movie gives you a sense of rejoice. the common man can save the neighborhood, save the day. to sum it up, this is far from being the original death wish, but it is rather good if you are just looking for an hour and a half of shoot 'em up.

since paul kersey was running short of actual relatives to avenge, the third installment in the "death wish" saga revolves on him returning to new york to visit an old war buddy. he arrives only to find out that brooklyn entirely changed into a pauperized gangland and that youthful thugs killed his friend and continuously terrorize all the other tenants of a ramshackle apartment building. kersey strikes a deal with the local police commissioner, conquers the heart of his blond attorney, blows away numerous villains with an impressive wildey magnum gun and gradually trains & inspires the petrified new yorkers to stand up for themselves. okay, there's no more point in defending the "death wish" series after seeing part three. the 1974 original was a masterpiece that revolved on the social drama as much as it did on the retribution and, even though it was pure exploitation, part two still had quite a few redeeming qualities and at least the events were a logically linked to those occurring in the first. number three frequently feels like a totally separate franchise. apparently, kersey isn't an architect anymore, he's ten times more social and talkative than he used to be and suddenly nobody, not even the police, is against vigilante actions anymore? all these changes and several other aspects make it more than obvious that michael winner and charles bronson reduced their "death wish" success to being a purely brainless and exploitative action series, with a death toll that gigantically increases with each episode, armory that becomes more and more explosive and criminals that get nastier, sleazier, meaner and a lot harder to kill. however, the gentlemen didn't seem to realize that the non-stop spitfire of violence actually creates an opposite effect, namely this extremely monotonous and much more boring than the previous two. i once read a brilliant review that referred to "death wish 3" as the pure definition of cinematic masturbation. this description couldn't be more spot-on, as the script tiredly moves itself from one repugnant execution sequence to the next. particularly the final twenty minutes are a complete "orgy" of gunfire, explosions and executions realized through improvised homemade measures. yi-haaa! this entry in the series has quite an interesting supportive cast, including martin balsam ("psycho", "12 angry men") as the fatigue neighbor who keeps machine guns in his closet, ed lauter ("family plot", "the longest yard") as the slightly unorthodox copper and even alex winter (from "bill and ted's excellent adventure!) in his debut role as one of the thugs.

the movie is a happy lullaby, was made to make us sleep. and that´s what we do, as we dream about the top beautiful natasha henstridge. no screenplay, no deep characters, nothing special. so, let´s sleep.

director fabio barreto got a strange academy nominea for his last movie o quatrilho. quatrilho is a bad movie, but in bella donna, barreto did one of the worst movies of all time. his adaptation of the novel riacho doce is ridiculous. think with me how poor brazilians fishermen speak a perfect english? in the film they do. there isn't a screenplay, it's only a very long videoclip with a beautiful places and many sex scenes with moscovis and henstridge.

the dvd for this film is by alpha video--a company that almost always releases the poorest quality prints. in alpha's defense, often that is the only print available, but the specialize in public domain and cheap-o films. if you can find another print by a different company, try it first as the print for this film is scratchy and faded. still, compared to most alpha dvds, this one is excellent--especially since the sound is pretty clear (and alpha never seems to include closed captionings--even with films with horrid sound).a man has been dating a lady for a very long time. one night, he's a bad boy and spends the night with another woman. soon afterwords, he comes clean to his fiancée about this, she forgives him and they marry.very soon after the wedding, he gets a frantic call from the other woman--she needs to see him and has just tried to kill herself. when they meet, he learns that she has an std and she wanted him to know that he, too, might now have it. then, although there is a nurse there and they are treating her for the suicide attempt, she somehow finds a gun and kills herself! the makes a huge mistake. he does not tell his doctor and he doesn't tell his new wife. some time passes and now she and the baby are infected! at this point, the doctor meets with the guy and tells him about the importance of getting treatment and they shows him rooms filled with horribly infected people (actually, these were just films of people with stds that they spliced into the film--most of whom have syphilis).in some ways the film is very progressive. it addresses a serious issue and it's interesting how the film encourages couples not to wait to get married but to marry fast and give in to those sexual urges--but only with each other (not bad advice at all). on the other hand, the film never exactly says what it's talking about. they never use the terms std, vd or the like, nor does it even name the diseases. often it is referring to syphilis but at other times it's talking about herpes or other stds--the information just isn't very clear or specific--a very common problem with such films from this era. audiences at the time must have felt quite confused about what they were seeing and many of the more naive probably needed to have some of their 'faster' friends explain it all to them! speaking of "such films", in the 1930s-50s, lots of small and often sleazy production companies made films decrying the dangers of drugs and sex (though often they really just wanted to promise a bit of cheesecake for audiences who usually could not see such racy fare in hollywood films). many of these are hysterically funny since they are so over-done and the information so inaccurate. the most famous examples are reefer madness and sex madness (both by the same two-bit production company) and compared to how salacious and stupid those two films are, this cheap film seems like it should be in the criterion collection!! interestingly, there are weirdos out there (i would definitely be included among them) that enjoy seeing the films because they are often so bad and so horribly made that they are great fun. this one, however, isn't that bad nor is the message that convoluted and the film of the victims isn't as grotesque as some similar films. while the message really should have been more explicit and useful, for a 1933 film it's pretty good--despite the occasionally poor acting and the ludicrous suicide scene. remember kids--just say 'no' to suicide!oh, by the way, the "two years of treatment" they talk about in the film was actually the norm for syphilis back in 1933. nowadays, it's a lot more treatable--as are the rest of the stds.

this movie is really bad, there is nothing appealing or worth of commentary in it except for the beautiful settings: chilean landscape. i know i must supply four lines as a commentary for this movie, but the thing is that it is such a bad movie, that i can only say that is actually bad. michael ironside is the only one who saves the money in the film.

one of the worst films i have ever seen! after watching it i walk out like, what happened? i am confused to this day, can someone explain that movie to me please? both the acting and picture quality are so bad ,you'll think you're watching someone's school project made with a home camcorder. first,i can not believe that how some people could give 10 star to this movie.because,.it's unbelievably bad movie! this movie isn't scary at all! there is even no typical horror clichés,too. the plot and acting of this movie was terrible. it's not,fantastic,surrealistic or horror,it's just hideously bad turkish feature film.and finally there were a lot of unnecessary scenes and unnecessary characters. when i watch 'gomeda' i fell into so hopeless,so sad for young turkish movie maker.please,please don't make 'cinema' like this!

he's the only reason to see this film. he gives a very good performance--much better than this crap deserves. he's very handsome and very talented--he deserves better than this. also depressing is to see malcolm mcdowell in this. he's another talented actor who deserves better but, like esai, he gives a very good performance. so, if you're fans of either of them you might want to watch. otherwise, stay away. one more complaint--couldn't we have had more scenes of esai shirtless?

southern cross, written and directed by james becket is a waste of good celluloid and actor's efforts. a formula film is not necessarily bad if it pays off on it's promise, which this film does not. it is a tiresome concoction of movie cliches that can be traced to a thousand different films from the past. it is full of random and empty plot twists that add nothing but aimless action, such as a trip by the protagonists to a ghost town where the villains (unexplainedly) follow them. this was obviously concocted as an excuse for a shoot out and escape scene bordering on the preposterous, with people popping in and out of doorways and running past windows while firing pistols at each other. it makes one believe that somebody told becket there was a ghost town in the chilean foothills and he said, "oh great, lets do a shoot out scene there."don't even waste your rental money on this. it is a bunch of random bits and pieces from a hundred different films thrown together to call an action drama.

formula movie about the illegitimate son of a rich chilenian who stands to inherit a fortune and gets mixed up in the affairs of bad guys and falls in love with a beautiful female lawyer (vargas). it looks very much like a tv movie, not really exciting. the only reason i bothered to see it was because valentina vargas was in it. no real surprises here, though it is nice to see vargas. great looking chilenian landscapes on display but malcolm mcdowell's part is very small and doesn't add much to the movie. michael ironside plays as usual a bad guy but this is not one of his most memorable parts. the chase scenes are standard fare.

take a cliché story and insert steve guttenberg.need i say anymore?this truly is as bad as you would expect. sheriff tom palmer(guttenberg)and anna montgormery attempt to transform a group of useless,inept kids into a winning soccer team.lacking originality and direction from the offset it's quite a struggle to maintain any form of interest in this film. despite my reservations about guttenbergs acting ability i can safely say that the acting of the rival teams coach is actually worse than guttenbergs.previously unimaginable i thought. this type of story of underdogs battling all the way to the top has been done before and better every time than this so called 'film'

nothing more than a soccer knock-off of the mighty ducks, this film proved to be annoying in most aspects. this was one of those times where you're parents ask you to take your younger siblings just so they don't have to deal with them for a few hours. to say the least, my younger sisters liked it, but it proved to be too much like the far superior mighty ducks. oh well, at least olivia d'abo was hot and steve guttenberg still had a job at that point in time.

this is one of the most unoriginal, cliche-ridden movies i have ever seen. even if you didn't like this film's antecedents, 'the bad news bears' and 'the mighty ducks,' they are bound to have done a better job than this one. from the moment the new teacher greets her class and they tell her, "don't bother with us, we're all losers," you can see everything that's coming twenty miles away for the rest of the film. all the usual suspects are here. besides the spunky teacher, we have a group of what are supposed to be endearingly bratty kids (they're brats, yes, but no so endearing), a slow-witted small town sheriff that they love to torment, an arrogant head coach of the winning rival team, etc., ad nauseum. only olivia d'abo as the new teacher displays any likabilty. i never cared much for steve guttenberg before and his performance as the sheriff doesn't change things. jay o. sanders is a capable actor but his character, the rival coach, leaves him nothing to work with. let's hope that writer/director holly goldberg sloan comes up with something better next time out.

how many movies are there going to be in which against all odds, a ragtag team beats the big guys with all the money?!!!!!!!! there's nothing new in "the big green". if anything, you want them to lose. steve guttenberg used to have such a good resume ("the boys from brazil", "police academy", "cocoon"). why, oh why, did he have to do these sorts of movies during the 1990s and beyond?! so, just avoid this movie. there are plenty of good movies out there, so there's no reason to waste your time and money on this junk. obviously, the "green" on their minds was money, because there's no creativity here. at least in recent years, disney has produced some clever movies with pixar.

also titled--> the magical castle--> this one is a stretch. why bother? why create another rockbart and then add another story line that has nearly nothing to do with the play nor swan lake. only some girlfriend of rockbart, the stolen book of forbidden arts and the original characters (not voices remain). stripped to to its bares this is a continuation by a thread. next thing you know some bird will have memorized the "forbidden arts" and swan princess 4: the magical bird will be born. thankfully though the chapters are supposedly closed and this will beginning but bad ended trilogy will come to a close.

terrific production and a good comedic performance by george clooney can't save curiously detached, occasionally clumsy quasi-comedy from joel and ethan coen. depression-era road tale hearkens back to yesterday with three escaped chain-gang prisoners seeking a hidden fortune, and inadvertently becoming country music stars in the process! the film meanders along but never builds any momentum. it does get a big boost from clooney's charismatic, gableesque mugging, and also from the art direction and t-bone burnett's lively music. otherwise, the screenplay (by the coens) is seriously lacking in humor and interest, supporting cameos by john goodman and holly hunter fail to add any lift, and the second-half of the movie slides precariously into self-indulgence. ** from ****

i loved the first movie, the second one was okay, disappointed john cleese wasn't jean bob anymore as hes my favorite character. but the third one...what happened to the animation??? it looks low budget like a sat morning cartoon! except for the flashback which was taken from the first movie. they really should have stopped after number 2, this just makes the rest look bad!! derek's voice has changed but its not as recognizable as jean bob..rogers also looks very strange. i also don't understand where rothbart came from. i thought he died! this movie made me want to turn it off, as much as i love the first one, i was very disappointed with this installment. they will never beat the original!:)

i had to rent a couple of movies for my little cousin for new year's and she picked out the swan princess: the mystery of the enchanted kingdom and the little mermaid 2 and we just watched both films, while she's sleeping, i figured i could get a couple comments in. :) while this is a very cheesy cartoon, it really wasn't that bad. you have to admit that for children, these plots are new to them and it could be a great introduction of these stories to them.odette finds out that derek has been secretly keeping the magic secrets of rosthoe and she tells derek to destroy them immediately, but him being a guy, typically he does not do so and tells her that no on could achieve the magics without his help. when a witch named zelda gets her hands on them, she finds out that derek tore off the last words of a spell she wants to use to destroy everything, and she kidnaps odette in order to retrieve this information.the swan princess: the mystery of the enchanted kingdom is silly and predictable, but for the kids i would honestly say it's a go. it's so rare we have these clean cut cartoons now a days, so i'm going to cut the film some slack. it was just weird seeing all the voices change all of a sudden, i grew up with the first one, so i guess it was just stuck in my head.4/10

i am the sort of person who never, ever watches animated movies, but i make an exception for thumbelina and the swan princess. being absolutely in love with the first installment of the series, i bought this and sat down to watch it with a very biased mind, determined to love it because i'd spent money buying it. i finished the movie, and all i can think is the horror!!! i wanted to like it, i really did. i tried very, very hard to like it. but i couldn't enjoy a second of this grueling film. the songs made me feel like ripping my ears out of my head. the dialogue was so lame i felt myself twitching with frustration and irritation every time someone opened his or her mouth. the villain was laughable and i felt myself wanting derek and odette to die in the end... and i was absolutely in love with them from the first film.i am going to try repress the memory of this movie, because it almost destroyed the first one for me. there is one song in the movie in which there are a series of flashbacks to the first film. the difference in animation between the two is made very obvious, and i began yearning for the first one and wishing i'd never set eyes on the third.do yourself and favor and don't waste your time.

i think my summary says it all. this mtv-ish answer to the classic candid camera tv show features a gen x (or is that gen y) type putting in false choppers and wearing various hats and wigs and glasses, and setting people up in fairly outlandish although often not very interesting situations. example: kennedy has a guy invite his parents to his "wedding." kennedy is the bride, done up in a full bridal gown and long wig. the "joke" is that the parents immediately understand their son is marrying a man who claims to no longer have his "bits and pieces." problem is, this schtick goes on way too long, obviously to fill out time. and kennedy is about as funny as a dead cod lying in the sun. candid camera would have run three or four scenarios in the time it took kennedy to get through this one, running around, constantly asking "do i look fat?" i recognize the show was not made for me. it was made for 12-year-old pinheads who think jackass is the height of comedy today. so let them laugh. thank god the show was short-lived.

wow, was this version of the racketeer tough to watch! while none of the other reviews have mentioned this, the public domain version i watched was seriously flawed. the sound track was off by about 10 seconds--meaning the dialog and action never came close to matching. so, you'd hear something occur well before you saw it--a very confusing proposition! the worst is where you hear a gun shot and only later doe the guy get hit and slump to his death in a taxi.while this seriously marred the film, it also made concentrating on the dialog easier--and showed the serious shortcomings of it as well. the dialog was simply awful--often delivered with almost no inflection or feeling. as one review said, it was like watching a high school play. part of this is understandable, as sound was a new medium, but this film's dialog was bad even compared to other 1929 films--really bad. and, like many of these early sound films, the film was just too talky--with sappy and overly melodramatic language and just not much action. and you'd think with a title like "the racketeer" that there would be some action!! however, it's really a sappy romance--with very little action.the film finds carol lombard straddled with an alcoholic musician. she herself ends up stealing to try to take care of him--and the crook, robert armstrong, comes to her assistance. when armstrong catches her cheating at cards, he covers for her and then helps the drunk brother to get on his feet--and naturally he falls for her in the process. the problem is that once the drunk sobers up, he, too, wants lombard and she needs to choose between them. wow...a recovering drunk or a mobster...talk about a couple great prospects! overall, it's a bit hard to rate considering the lousy print i saw. however, even if you ignore this, the film has a lot of problems due to its poor use of dialog and excessively talky nature. and...it was sappy too boot.

carole lombard stars in this transition period film. this film is a typical example of a very early "talkie" (first practical sound film was "the jazz singer", 1927). overall, the acting in this film tends to be extremely broad and very melodramatic.the viewer may easily note that the actors are still "acting" for a silent film, and this combined with the overly pronounced, overly earnest dialog (it seems most likely a diction-elocution-drama coach was employed extensively to teach the "silent" actors to speak lines), creates some rather comical scenes which were not at all intended to be comical.carole lombard's later great acting ability is all but unrecognizable underneath all the broad gestures, melodrama, and eager earnestness.mainly interesting as an historical curiosity of the period, and for it's completely unintended comedy-camp value.

time has not been kind to this film from the transition days of sound from silent. the plot has a gangster falling for a socialite who wants to help the down on his luck violinist she loves. there are of course complications. the problem with the film for me is that it hasn't aged well. performances are all over the place with some emotional scenes seeming so over the top as to be laughable. one late exchange where carol lombard throws someone out of her room had me howling with its sing song delivery. there are other times when the film becomes static, a sign of the limitations of the microphones. its not a bad film, its just that the technical limitations of the film get in the way of real enjoyment. normally i'm forgiving, but this time out i just couldn't go with the flow (then again the copy i saw was absolutely horrible). worth a shot in a forgiving mood (and to be reminded that robert armstrong actually did more than play carl denham in king kong)

"the racketeer" stars carol (deprived of the "e" that usually appeared at the end of her first name) lombard as a woman thrown out of society because she left her husband for a concert violinist (roland drew) who has since become a down-and-out alcoholic, and torn between her love for him and the interest of new york crime kingpin robert armstrong (top-billed). it's virtually a compendium of what was wrong with the earliest talkies: stiff direction, immobile cameras, stagy acting and ridiculously slow-paced delivery of lines. at the time the sound crews were telling the directors to have their actors speak every line s-l-o-w-l-y and not to start speaking their own line until after the previous actor had finished theirs. done about five years later, this could have been an interesting movie, but director howard higgin faithfully follows his sound recorder's dictates and systematically undercuts the talents we know lombard and armstrong had from watching their later movies. "the racketeer" was made in 1929, a year that despite the transition problems from silent to sound nonetheless gave us some legitimate masterpieces  vidor's "hallelujah!," mamoulian's "applause," wyler's "hell's heroes," capra's "ladies of leisure"  all from directors with strong enough wills to tell the soundboard dictators to get stuffed and let their actors talk and act naturalistically. too bad howard higgin wasn't that strong; as it is, watching a naturally rapid-paced actor like armstrong slog through the part in the ridiculous way he's been told to speak, one can't help but wonder where that 50-foot gorilla is when armstrong needs him.

sammi cheng & andy lau are coupled yet again in their 3rd film -- yesterday once more -- directed by hk's actioneer johnnie to...fans of to's action films will be disappointed to find not a single gun was used in the filming...furthermore, fans of cheng & lau's previous films, needing you & love on a diet, will also be disappointed to find that yesterday is no where near as funny or endearing...mr. & mrs. to (lau & cheng) are a divorced couple...both affluent hk citizens...both incredibly mischievous...both just happened to be professional thieves -- 'two birds of the same feather'....a couple years earlier, they divorced over an inability to find middle ground on splitting the loot...now she's remarrying...to the son of a rich heiress -- a total momma's boy (carl ng) through & through...the soon-to-be mother-in-law (jenny woo) is suspicious of mrs. to's past & thinks she's only marrying her son for the family jewels -- the heiress' priceless ruby necklace...the necklace is stolen...is it mrs. to's materialistic eye that gets the best of her?... or is it her ex-husband, mr. to's way of sabotaging the marriage to steal the jewels for himself?...this is not a movie about two pple falling in love or rekindling a love...its about two pple who have always been in love but have somehow been to foolish to realize it...they let pride & greed overwhelm them...overall: yesterday is one part caper/heist film & one part homage to classic hollywood glamour from its golden years -- i.e. cary grant & grace kelly's to catch a thief...johnnie to is riding too heavily on cheng/lau's chemistry from their previous films...hoping cheng/lau's immense popularity & fan base will be enough justification for this third film....i think sammi cheng is one of the most likable/charming entertainers working t'day...& lau is definitely the tom cruise of asian cinema...i really enjoyed their first two films & consider the cheng/lau pairing comparable to those classic hollywood couples of the 40's & 50's...but yesterday falls very short of expectations...terrible writing, ridiculous situations, product placements galore, & all the subplots & supporting characters were unnecessary...come to think of it...this film was unnecessary...unless you just love celebrity watching...

i've seen several stage and film adaptations of alice in wonderland and this one has to take the cake as the absolute worst. my family bought the dvd unsuspectingly and couldn't even make it through the first half. i later went back and forced myself to watch the whole thing (it had been a christmas gift to me) and was just appalled.the only redeeming factor (and it's hardly redeeming enough to save the whole show) is mark lin-baker playing the mock turtle with a yiddish accent. it's one of the few moments in the piece that has some real charm and can be taken somewhat seriously. other than that, the songs are half-songs, the melodies are half-melodies and even meryl streep cannot make this direction look good.

earnest effort which achieves some success to adapt the classic odyssey story to a '30's nostalgia period piece. the adventurers this time are escaped convicts, wandering about the depression afflicted south bungling their way into trouble.the greatest strength of the film is the wonderful music soundtrack, effectively evoking not only the era that this is set in, but the spiritual references that run rampant in the film. besides its value to the tone of the movie, the music is just plain fun to listen to.what cripples the film is that the characters really aren't that likable. in a comedy, you need that element in order to have fun along with them in their misadventures. instead, we have a bunch of selfish, arrogant, soulless, mean spirited nobodies who really have no positive points at all. they're not imposing enough to make you hate them either, so it's hard to relate to them at all. they're offered up as clowns, but like people who put clown makeup on and march in parades, they just aren't funny.like the story that inspired it, the movie takes these guys on an "odyssey," encountering a variety of symbolic (some even mystical) characters. everybody is stamped with offensive stereotypes, the operative word being "stupid." people are mocked right and left, and consequently, no one is left being particularly interesting or appealing. the movie doesn't like its own characters, and it doesn't let you like them, either.riverside baptisms, beautiful sirens, stolen cars, fistfights, radio preachers, people being whipped with sticks; all are thrown at you in disjointed fashion. some evoke a few laughs, others confuse or bore you. i did laugh when a nerdy guy beat the snot out of an especially obnoxious lead character. but there were a lot more pointlessly gratuitous scenes; an example: some '30's dillinger-type guy strafes cows with a tommy-gun. comedy? symbolism? no; just mindless violence, which detracts from the intellectual nature of the original source material this story draws upon.other adaptations of the odyssey are much better. unless you're a george clooney fan, rent something else. but buy the soundtrack cd; the music is great.

how can anybody give this anything higher than a '1'?i thought "manos, the hands of fate" would forever be the worst movie ever to impinge itself upon my optic nerve. indeed, i didn't think anything could be worse.i was wrong. "galaxina" is that rare movie where every single element of it is achingly, agonizingly, blindingly bad. how often have you watched a movie and commented, "who the hell lit this thing?" from lighting to soundtrack to effects to script to acting to cinematography to . . . well, everything, this movie is absolutely unendurable. it's so bad, i couldn't even tell for some time if it was the worst comedy or the worst drama i'd ever seen.it's too bad even to be laughable. i'd sooner eat a platefull of broken glass than sit through it again.

if ever there was a film that can be considered a missed opportunity then that film is galaxina. what could possibly be wrong in basing a sci-fi film around a sexy statuesque female android? surely such a film could never be a complete waste of time? well, sadly this movie is pretty close to useless. there are a number of faults with this production it has to be said, however, there are two basic problems that entirely destroy the whole enterprise. firstly, this is a comedy with no funny bits at all, or at the very least a film where the potentially amusing aspects are presented in an incredibly unamusing way. secondly, the title character is woefully underused. this may be because dorothy stratten was not really an actress but if so it was a terrible decision as she is still easily the best thing about the film. i don't think she really needed to be a great thespian to pull off the role of a sexy android to be perfectly honest. anyway, what we are left with is a whole lot of mind-numbing comedy relief, which often is made up of hopeless spoof-type gags of the big sci-fi hits of the time such as alien, star wars and 2001. it's badly written and not funny at all, and it doesn't even really have a plot to propel things along. the story basically is about a police space-cruiser that is sent to get a rock. that's it! steven spielberg once said that a high-concept movie was one whose plot line could be described in one sentence. what he didn't define was what you call a movie that can be described in less than a sentence - pointless maybe?this seemed like a sure-fire winner to me but it failed miserably. it seems to have been an attempt to spoof star wars and combine it with adult comedy situations. all it does actually achieve is to leave you cold and a little irritated that it wasn't close to what it should've been. a barbarella for the 80's this ain't.shortly after this film was finished dorothy stratten was murdered in an appallingly violent and horrific way. and for that reason galaxina has derived a considerable amount of it's cult interest. i just think it's a great shame that dorothy didn't have a better film left to immortalise her.

the odd thing about galaxina is not that it is supremely bad, although it is. the odd thing is that in spite of being supremely bad, it is not funny. supremely bad movies have their own particular brand of unintended humor--the secret of their success, you might say. but galaxina is quite uniquely different--it is mst3k's worst nightmare, a bad movie in which the intentional *and* the unintentional humor alike fall flat.it is easy enough to figure out why the intentional jokes fail--and the reasons are quite varied. sometimes it's a timing question; sometimes it's a good idea badly worked out (the human restaurant *could* have been hilarious, but it wasn't); sometimes it feels like there was some mixup in the cutting room, with the punchline ending up on the floor; and sometimes the jokes are just bad jokes. bad movies get their laughs from such unintentional snafus. it's harder to figure out why galaxina doesn't get any laughs on that count. something is subtly wrong with the unintentional humor in this movie, just as something is wrong (not at all subtly) with the intentional humor. it is a supremely bad movie whose very badness is not the redeeming quality it usually is. it's absolutely unique in my experience.

this is not the worst movie i've ever seen. i did not feel like i wanted to remove my eyeballs forcibly after watching galaxina. it just is not good. the jokes are almost funny, but fall short. all of them. the few gags that come close are beat back down by repeating them over and over. the production values are, well, non-existent. the sound is bad, the lighting is bad, ... it just seems cheaply made; overly so. the dialog ... well, often it is missing - many awkward silences; they are all just standing around, and it seems like someone should be saying something. the film even seems ambivalent about what it wants to be - it is not always clear that it was intended as a comedy - like maybe that developed after shooting started. it feels like someone's film project that they threw together the night before it was due, and if they had put two weeks into it, it could have been good.and i'm easy to please. i thought "mom and dad save the world" was a hoot. i like "pluto nash". "mystery men" is one of my favorite movies. "spaced invaders" is well nigh unto a classic. this turkey just doesn't do it. "space truckers" was more believable.avery schreiber, who can be very funny, tries too hard. his part calls for a straightman, and he plays it leaning toward sitcom. dorothy stratten is ok in her role, but not particularly noteworthy.oh, yeah, the "my watch is always slow." line was funny. i'll give this movie all the kudos it can get, it needs it.the space vehicle models are not bad, but they are few and are not used effectively. the space scenes are vague. no sweeping passes, no close up detailed fly-bys, not even appropriate action scenes when they dock. (the infinity does crash land very oddly at one point.) the flight dynamics are terrible; worse than anything you've seen, they're jerky, not smooth. the initial battle is stilted and static; even though the two ships have just shown that they can maneuver in their jerky fashion, they trade (slow) shots at close range in a manner that is more reminiscent of a 16th century sea battle, except not as exciting.the aliens - imagine if all of star wars was the cantina scene. that many rubber masks could get dull rather rapidly, no? a few are used as sight gags that work ok the first time, but not the fifth.mercifully, if you attempt to watch galaxina, you are likely to fall asleep. (i got busy doing something else and missed the last ten minutes, and did not feel like it was worth replaying it. if that doesn't say "it sucked", i don't know what does.) sadly, there is a lot of potential, and this could easily have been a good movie. it would be easy to remake this and have a decent film.madkaugh

i'm not a movie snob. i've liked lots of movies that critics hate, and i've hated movies that critics love. however, i have to agree with critics here--"galaxina" is just substandard. clearly intended to be a comedy, it only has a few scattered laughs. "galaxina" has poor photography; it has poor special effects; it has some pretty poor acting; and the production values...well, the sets might as well have been made of cardboard."galaxina" tells the story of a spaceship whose crew is looking for a magical object called "the blue star". after a long voyage (and some very unconvincing space battles), the crew arrives at its destination, a sort of wild west alien world. there's a painfully unfunny cantina scene (clearly designed to be a spoof of the famous "star wars" scene), a chase involving space bikers, and a final getaway.the cast tries, but can't breathe life into this turkey. stephen macht and avery schreiber have done better work in other movies. james david hinton is pretty good as a member of the spaceship's crew. the late dorothy stratten stars as the robot of title, and while she looks great, her role doesn't give her much of a chance to act.you might catch this film to see dorothy stratten. however, if you're looking for a good movie, you'll probably want to skip this one.

i've seen worse films. this is bad but at least doesn't try to be good so it deserves a brief round of applause. it rest firmly in the realms of the low-budget b-movie sci-fi genre.it is a rubbish film but in a nice way and is certainly worth buying if it's in the bargain bin at your local supermarket. awfully charming rather than just plain awful.the highlight for me is when galaxina's lover goes to rescue her. upon turning up she exclaims "bunnyfluff!" which draws sniggers from his co-pilot.sit back, get drunk, enjoy!

although not a big coen brothers fan, i am an admirer of their dark humor films like 'fargo' and 'miller's crossing.' i have been much less impressed by their other comic mode, goofy-camp (or is that camp goofy?) unfortunately, 'o brother, where art thou?' falls into the latter category and isn't even as good as 'the big lebowski' or 'the hudsucker proxy.''o brother' is basically an episodic series of in-jokes without much point, and not all that much humor or cleverness either. as most reviewers have noted, the film's plot is very loosely  and, as far as i could tell, quite arbitrarily  based on the odyssey. its main character, ulysses everett mcgill (george clooney), is an 'adventurer' like his homeric namesake and has as his 'real' goal the return home to prevent the marriage of his wife penny to a suitor. of course, we don't discover that this is what the clooney/ulysses character really wants until long after we've stopped caring. and what does homer have to do with "cool hand luke" chain gangs, ku klux klan meetings a la "indiana jones" cult gatherings, a disbarred lawyer's vocabulary, a talent for blue-grass country music singing, an association with baby face nelson, a clark gable lookalike hairdo, and other random and sundry character traits and encounters? i leave that for others to discern.the allusion to preston sturges' 'sullivan's travels' in 'o brother's' title is equally pointless. yes, viewers familiar with the sturges minor screwball comedy classic might find it mildly rewarding to recognize the title of the socially conscious depression movie sullivan abandons hollywood and comedy hoping to make. and they might even be mildly amused by a couple of shot/scene riffs (e.g. hopping freight cars, and the chain gang shuffle into view a movie). but so what? the coen brothers don't seem to have anything to add to the art-for-art's-sake versus moral high seriousness critical debate about the function of art. they obviously fall into the former school, but that doesn't seem to motivate the reference in the slightest. is it an homage? if so, why make it? i like post-modern pop culture reference and textual play as much as the next person, but it's a lot nicer when it amounts to something at least tonally, if not thematically, consistent  and not just an arbitrary concoction.this screenplay is simply a silly mess. the only consistent, and consistently pleasing, element is the folk/country music soundtrack. it doesn't have much to do with homer or preston sturges, but, considering the rest of the film, that's probably a good thing. on the other hand, i'd recommend using the price of admission on the soundtrack cd.

although there is very little plot and whatever exists is just all improvisational, still it was a good start from a new director with no previous financial back up and also a smart move from andy warhol to make his cimematic productions more marketable and viewer-friendly. in any case this story of a street hustler relies too much on showing joe buck naked (almost all the time!). and the creative use of a flashy editing really wears off after the hundredth time and the cutting off the dialog thing gets really annoying half-way. this would have been a much more entertaining or even dramatic if they made a documentary of the daily of an actual male prostitute or hustler, instead of letting the actors make up some nonesensical plot and dialog of their own.

technically abominable (with audible "pops" between scenes)and awesomely amateurish, "flesh" requires a lot of patience to sit through and will probably turn off most viewers; but the dialogue rings amazingly true and joe dallesandro, who exposes his body in almost every scene, also gives an utterly convincing performance. a curio, to be sure, but the more polished "trash", made two years later, is a definite step forward. i suggest you watch that instead. (*1/2)

i guess only a selected number of audience members really had any interest in watching how a male hustler in new york operates but i'd be willing to bet that even these brave souls were turned off by the irritating patchwork technique and deliberately muffled sound recording on display here; the fact that these inherent 'defects' were a direct result of the film's low-budget/underground/experimental nature is, i'd say, beside the point. anyway, for those so inclined, the film features extensive male nudity and joe dallesandro, understandably, became an underground  and gay  icon! the episodic structure showing the day-to-day routine of the hustler protagonist offers a couple of mildly interesting scenes: his meeting with (and eventually posing for) an eccentric elderly artist; the one where dallesandro expresses his views on his unusual line of work and delineates his particular modus operandi to a couple of prospective 'colleagues' including perhaps the unlikeliest of hustlers  a bespectacled nerd! perhaps mercifully, the film ran for only 89 minutes against the imdb's claim that its complete length is 105 (but the latter could well be a mistake)! i had watched a few other of warhol's 'movies' and this one is decidedly not as satisfying as the most tolerable example i've run into yet, bad (1977), and only slightly better than the likes of my hustler (1965) which were mostly a strain to sit through. the fact that this was only the first part of a trilogy did not augur well but, as the saying goes, you gotta to do what you gotta do and the other two 'chapters' had to follow in quick succession... despite my generally negative reaction to it, flesh is nevertheless still valuable as a 1960s time capsule and as a prototype of the underground scene of that era, both cinematically and in real life. for the record, an image of dallesandro from this film adorns the sleeve of the smiths' self-titled 1984 debut album and transsexual candy darling (who appears here rather unremarkably) was immortalized in "candy says", the opening track of the velvet underground's eponymous 1969 album. although the latter band is my all-time favorite, and one of the reasons for this is that, through their sheerly unique and ground-breaking music, they described a lifestyle so utterly different from my own, this is truly a case where i'd much rather experience something aurally instead of visually!

it's hard to believe that oprah winfrey produced this piece of junk, the show couldn't even hold a candle to cooking shows of the past, including emeril lagasse, rachael ray is the most annoying talk show and cooking show host in tv history, not since ainsley harriott has had a terrible cooking show host i've watched, at least ainsley harriott has some good moments and some style, this one has no style at all, she's terrible as host, the kitchen looks atrocious, the writing is horrible, the teleplay is over the top and the opening credits are so bad, it makes me sick. now i enjoy cooking shows that had a cool sense of style, but this has absolutely none of thatthis is one of the worst tv of the year.

it seems like if you are going to post here it going to be a 10 star rating ,nobody ever seems to dislike anything ,well i am honest, some don't like that but here we go, rachel ray show is just plain awful.!!!!!!, this show reminds me of the snl character linda whatever if she had a cooking -whatever show.i must say i liked rachel on the food network on $35-$40 a day but i am sorry she does not have enough life experience to make her interesting day in and day out,give me ham on the street, anthony bourdain , interesting folks,but most of all i find her annoying, she actually told a member of the studio audience to "shut up" yes in a kidding way but shut up is shut up, and who cares about her pet stories, sorry rachel you been cancelled!!!!

here is a rundown of a typical rachael ray show:1. the awful theme song begins to play, and rachael descends wearing her snapcrotch outfit in this bizarre cargo elevator. 2. she begins running around screaming and/or insulting the audience, then yells at them sit down. 3. an awkward monologue.(the next are in any order) 4. a segment tooting rachael's own horn (i.e. "i lost 500 pounds with rach's recipes, "rachael ray saved my life," "rachael's fashion tips.") 5. a totally useless d.i.y. tip (i.e. how to engrave words into casserole dishes, how to use your washing machine as a salad spinner, how to build a tube of lipstick with a light on it.) 6. the unleashing of horrible recipe on the unsuspecting audience (reaction shots of first bites are never shown). 7. a celebrity guest with an awkward interview, followed by some obviously scripted questions from the audience. 8. a person who gets help from one of rachael's cronies (i.e. the i say yes to everything woman, the i own nothing but overalls lady, and the i can't find time to put on makeup housewife). what would they do without you rachael. *gasp*reasons that this show should be avoided like the plague: 1. fakeness: rachael ray claims that entire show is unscripted. many people who have attended tapings of the show have claimed that the entire show is scripted. many of these same people have also mentioned that there is even a very strict dress code for the show. 2. her show jumps around too much: where as oprah, who is the highest rated talk show host of all time has a definite theme for her show, rachael's jumps around like an adhd soda child on crack. her show averages perhaps 10, short, worthless segments a show. on second you will be getting fashion tips from kojo, and the next rachael will be making gross stuffed "spanish" peppers with manchego cheese, and the next their will be a giant anaconda up on stage, and the next, well you get the picture.3. rachael is a poor host with bad ideas: aside from her grating personality, rachael's hosting ability is terrible, at best. her questions for her celebrity guests are poor, and often times not even relevant to the interview, and her segments are unappealing and offer little educational, or humorous value.in conclusion, you need not waste your time with this schlock. it will be canceled soon anyways.

my first warning should have been that this dvd was on sale for $5.00. but since it featured sandra bullock, who i generally like, i bought it. my disappointment with the film began almost immediately. the dialogues are slow and stiff. the color is distorted. i kept adjusting the volume to hear the conversations. the acting is amateurish. even the killing scenes are a failure. twice, dead people moved their legs. when my cash-deficient daughter offered me a dollar to turn off the movie, i immediately and joyfully complied. this is an amazingly bad movie. tomorrow i am giving this dvd away at the company white elephant christmas party.

i don't know how this dvd made its way into my collection - my wife suggested it was one of these "3 for £20" deals at a high street store. the thing isn't worth 66p, let alone £6.66! having invested heavily in it, i felt duty-bound to watch it to the end, just to make sure it was equally bad all the way through - and it was.the dialog was awful, the story line was impenetrable (i still don't understand what the hell was going on, despite having read the synopsis), the camera work was disjointed and hopeless, the acting was wooden (not helped by the dialogue).in fact there were no redeeming features - no, not even the lovely sandra bullock, on whose glittering subsequent career this pile of dross has probably been sold. she should get her agent to buy up all the rights to it and then bury it asap.as a final amusing example of the director's ineptitude, there was a scene where the young lead is conversing with his father's ex-army sidekick while driving. this was the clearest bit of dialogue in the film - no engine noise whatsoever! i look forward to the engine-damping technology eventually making its way across the pond into british cars!

i watched 5% of this movie tonight and you may tell me that i need to see the whole movie to understand it, but frankly i don't think so.what the hell is the story in this movie? i saw a lot of people running around in a factory, shooting at everything around them.where to start? okay..1) they were shooting around the place as if it was the terminator or something they were trying to kill. the entire place is made of metal, but not a single bullet sparked on the metallic surfaces.2) no ricochet. metal vs metal is bound to cause ricochets, but apparently no one got hit by a stray bullet.3) magic bullets? in one scene a bad-guy is standing right in front of a good-guy when another good-guy pops out behind the bad-guy and pumps him full of metal. you see the bullets exit his chest as it explodes in a bloody mist, but the good-guy right in front of him doesn't get hurt at all! 4) after having just splattered a human being all over the wall, the two good-guys tell each other some jokes and they laugh and look like teenagers playing with soft-guns.5) sound? at one point the good-guys cut a wire and an alarm goes off (who the hell cuts a wire just to set off an alarm?). the lady screams out "alarm in sector blah blah" and the bad-guy boss says "okay.. this.. is.. not.. a.. drill.. blah blah" in a very, very amateur kinda way. ooh, we're getting ambushed by terrorists, this isn't a drill, but i'm gonna sound like i don't give crap.6) focus!! first you see the bad-guys load up on weapons. for some reason the same guy gets the same uzi twice. deja vu or loop of scenes? you literally see every single bad-guy receive the same kind of weapon and they lock and load the same way. the weapons dealer pops in the clip and the bad-guy extra no. xx locks and loads. when they started opening fire you had to see the barrel flashes. boooring!! 7) actors or dummies? one of the presumed good-guys throw down a smoke grenade for some reason and of course the bad-guys are suddenly inside the smoke because they're smoke-blind or something so they don't see it coming. they cough and moan as if it was anthrax in the grenade. then a semi-boss bad-guy arrives and he doesn't even cough when he enters the smoke, he just pushes the other bad-guys away and they suddenly realize that the smoke isn't anthrax anyway.8) b flick? i think yeah! a guy sliding down a metal pipe wielding a uzi in his right hand shooting away at someone in his eye height apparently. i'd like to see a guy fire a uzi with one hand and i'd like to see him go get his hand afterwards. extra bloody gore mess in a b flick kinda way. small *pops* and a red hole with a torn shirt indicates that this guy is dead. though the first bullet hit his heart the good-guy who is a super trained green berets still feel the urge to empty his clip into the dead guy.9) one of these mentioned trained soldiers jump out from his hide with an empty clip! how stupid can you be!? always check your clip before facing an unknown amount of enemies! 10) boring scenes. like the barrel flash scenes and the lock and load scenes, the movie is filled with time wasting scenes of people running around in an apparently empty building. cut to the action if you're going for a b flick movie, please.my two cents on this movie.

i saw this one remastered on dvd. it had a big picture of sandra on it and said "starring sandra...." and made it seem like she had a big part in it. not so. she's barely in it. she does what she can with the script, but that's not much. the sound was awful. by that i mean things didn't go together. shots would be fired and the number of shots didn't correspond to the sound. people talking in a car while it's moving and the shot is from outside the windshield but there's no motor noise, road noise, or any other sound. kind of weird.score was awful. it sounded like the same few notes over and over. dialog really awful. acting was awful, i couldn't believe any of it. fight scenes were like a batman comic without the "biff", and "bam". they were really lame. the shooting scenes, i mean with firearms, were laughable, literally. i fast-forwarded through a lot of this movie. even then, it was too long.

i checked this out for free at the library, and i still feel ripped off. yes, sandra bullock is actually in it, but only in five scenes totaling up to barely 5 minutes, and even those are fairly painful to watch. the rest of the movie is so bad that you'll spend most of the time hoping it will end soon, but only if you're one of those people who have to finish a movie once they start it. everyone else will just turn it off. don't worry, you aren't going to miss anything. bullock's lines (assuming that you were tricked into watching this because her name is plastered on the case) are essentially just parroting of other characters lines, like this dialog:lisa (bullock) - "danny, please tell me what is going on."danny - "i don't know." lisa - "whaddaya mean you don't know?" danny - "i don't know - it's something to do with my dad." lisa - "whaddaya mean your dad?" danny - "i don't know - he ****ed up or something." lisa - "why am i here?" danny - "i'm sorry lisa. i don't know." (moments later) danny - "some army buddies of my dad . . . " lisa - "whaddaya mean army buddies?"see what i mean? bottom line - just say no.

the dvd version we bought had sandra bullock on the cover, but we've discovered it was a picture of her from another movie. unfortunately, she is in this movie very little. you can, however, see how far she has come.the one other bright spot in the movie, besides her very small part, were a few of the location scenes, shot in nyc and new jersey in the 1980s.the sound is terrible. sometimes the background noise is so loud that the dialog is difficult to hear. sometimes the dialog has been redone without any background noises at all, which is disconcerting. for example, sometimes when they are in the car, the noises from the car are too loud, and then suddenly there is absolutely no extra noise at all. the director is fond of close-ups on faces, and then it's clear that the movie has been over-dubbed because the words don't match the lip movements. through most of the movie, the voices sound like the people are speaking into a tin can.background music, when there is music, is distracting instead of adding to the movie.the direction is laughable. goofy camera angles and sound effects make the movie look like a joke, especially during times when there is supposed to be tension, like in the middle of gun battles. the writing is terrible. there are some subplots that make no sense, and most of the characters come off looking very stupid because there is no explanation at all to their motivations. the writer/director tries to explain some of the relationships between the men that were together in vietnam, but none of it makes sense. these top assassins and former soldiers don't seem to be able to see other people's shadows or hear other people moving. the actors go from calm to panic and back to calm again without any warning. it's simply a combination of bad directing and bad writing.the production values are so bad that at first, we thought we had stumbled on someone's student film that just happened to have sandra bullock in it. if you like laughing at really poorly done student films, then this movie is for you. otherwise, avoid this movie.

wait until you've watched most of all other films ever released, wait a year, then watch this when you're ready for something with such low production values it that will not challenge anybody's imagination.i agree that whoever rated this movie as a ten-star production has to be doing it to skew the data. anything above 8 would be odd.nice to see the very young sandy bullock in her poofy hair for the short time she was featured, though she overdid the new yorker accent but other times her southern (virginia & nc) accent did sneak through. ancient history for this accomplished actress who has grown so much since this film.the dvd i rented had two bonus features, a mini-bio section that only featured sandra's bio - taken verbatim from imdb. it also had a trivia quiz as a bonus - 3 questions. hope you get them all right!

i walked into blockbuster, itchin' to watch some good old fashion action movies. so i browsed around the action section until this movie caught my attention because the cover had in big bold letter sandra bullock. an action movie with sandra bullock in it and it's rated r!? yay! although i will admit i prefer her in a comedy but if this is anything like 'speed' then i was sold. sadly sandra really is not in this movie, her role is minor: "panicky kidnapped girlfriend" (she is in fifth place on the actors listing for jeebus shakes!) apparently this was her first movie role (and after watching this movie, i figured as much) sandra is the only living human in this movie, everyone else might as well be a zombie in a b-horror flick. this movie deceived me saying sandra was the lead . . . i fell for it like biff from 'back to the future' when marty yells "what's that . . .!!!" god, i wish i watched that instead of this.sandra is the only bright side of this movie, every time she is on camera it is like she is picking up shock paddles and yelling "clear!" to get this movies going but it flat lines no matter how hard she tries. more on sandra later . . . the movie is dull. very dull. think of the dullest moment in your life then imagine living through that moment for 110 minutes (for me, it is this movie). this movie even somehow makes gun fights and bullet time effects boring, so boring that elephant tranquilizers are put to shame. and this movie's idea of bullet time is a close up of an ak in slow motion which mocks you as the caps spitting out of it represent each second of your life as it slowly ticks away. and i knew i was watching a bad movie because i found myself fast forwarding "through-the-action!" the plot? . . . there was a plot? music? . . . even by 80s muck standards is bad but at least it's the one thing that kept me awake. acting? sandra bullock was good and . . . ummm . . . moving on. is it any good since it is rated r? no, unless r stands for ridicules-snooze-fest.and it is really 80s cliché when a movie opens with an overhead view of a city (rocking guitar licks or power ballet) and ends with a gun fight in a grim factory complete with steel walkways and assorted pipes. both of which this movie satisfies. at least this movie establishes what era it's from which was unnecessary since sandra's hair was screaming "1980s!!!!" and a movie gets really ham fisted when you watch an assassin stripper kill a nerd in the bathroom and stuff his body in a box, which you respond to sadly saying: "that is probably the most action that poor sap ever got." another hammy moment is at the beginning when some-secret-agent-dude caps a crowd of people and apparently this movie thinks people jump into the air and fall to the ground when they die. all that scene needed was the mario death ditty or maybe contra sound effects but nintendo might have sued.and it is sad when the main action hero of this movie rips off other better movie icons. before the big gun scene, da hero is found standing in a boxing ring ('rocky' anyone?), sporting a leather fedora (not 'indiana jones' too) with an ominous spotlights behind him (terminator the 2nd before owning t-1000) what is really really sad is that people on youtube or dailymotion can film better quality videos (with a crappy webcam no less) then this movie. i'm serious, most rant videos recorded with bad audio and blurry picture are more entertaining then this movie. i cannot even call this movie by it's given name for it's very name bring back horrid memories of watching this cruel and unusual punishment (a freaking violation against human rights!) the only bright speck in this dark abysmal abyss is sandra's career started taking off thanks to this movie. but oh sandra . . . why did you have to be in such a nightmare? the paycheck better been worth it. the dvd also graces you with a little back story on sandra as an extra, seen how she is the only one from this movie who end up being a house hold name. which explains why this movie uses her name as bait for unsuspecting movie buffs, crafty little critter.i don't have much experience with bad films but i know bad when i see it. i could bounce back from 'mazes and monsters' with a good old campy bruce willis comedy. but not even bruce could cheer me up after this movie. i have yet to see any ed wood or uwe boll but i think i'm amped for them now. for i can't even fathom a movie worse then . . . "gag" . . . 'hangmen' . . .

i give it a 2 - i reserve a 1 rating for guy ritchie and woody allen films. we don't even remember what this movie was about. the only thing we recall is one gunshot scene where the actors drop to the ground, roll to the other side of a hallway or something and then get back up shooting. it was like watching 80-year-olds with 2 broken legs trying to perform the 'stunts'. also, when the characters were driving in a truck, the engine noise (or radio? can't recall) would vanish entirely when the actors were talking.and, like others, we bought it because of the sandra bullock front cover. very sad, very bad.

i love sandra bullock-she's one of my all-time favorite actresses-but this is a movie that she should have paid a long time ago to be trash-canned. i realize that it's almost 20 years old-but my dead grandmother can act better than these people did. beware-it's not even worth the $ 5.50 walmart rack...you know that when the acting stinks this bad that it's not even worth a couple of bucks-the sound quality is horrendous-there's no closed captioning to even hear the hideous dialog, and it looks as if it were filmed on a $ 1.98 budget. i thought that i'd like to see sandra in an early role to see how she evolved as an actress-but yikes is too kind a word to use...

as the metaphoric flies fled this steaming watery stool of a film i found myself longing to join them.from the opening sentences, you quickly gather that the actors are talentless. the script editor was probably dead and the director should be. to be honest i didn't manage to finish this film because about twenty dismal minutes in the sight of the main actress scuttling across the floor like a shetland pony that has been shot in the ass was too much for me to stomach.i have never, and i mean never, seen a film as sweaty as this one and i watch tons of crap films.turd.

blackwater valley exorcism is set on a small town ranch where teenager isabelle (kristin erickson) is found wandering around covered in dog's blood. her parents ely (randy colton) & blanche (leslie fleming-mitchell) own the ranch & are deeply worried about their daughter, recently she has not been herself & is considered a danger to herself & other's. ranch hand & ex-priest miguel (del zamora) recognises isabelle's symptoms as a possible case of possession & when she starts to speak ancient latin in a strange voice he becomes convinced of it. blanche calls priest jacob (cameron daddo) who is her other daughter claire's (madison taylor) ex husband to see isabelle, he confirms miguel's suspicions & accepts the job of performing the exorcism that will hopefully banish the demon inside isabelle & an innocent girl free...directed by ethan wiley i was sat there in my house in front of my telly watching blackwater valley exorcism & i kept asking the same question over & over again, why do i do it. why do i keep sitting through all these awful low budget horror films that look like they were shot on a camcorder? right lets honest about this, blackwater valley exorcism is a complete total & utter unashamed rip-off of the exorcist (1973) & you literally tick off the major plot points that the two share. there's the possessed teenage girl who starts to get very horny & suggest inappropriate things, the demon that uses past misdemeanour's against other's, the worried parents, the way that the possessed girl is shunned by doctor's, the priest with a troubled past & the possessed girl is tied to her bed amongst other things. i suppose where blackwater valley exorcism is different (other than it's total crap) is that it tries to give all the character's some screen time & tries to get across how the situation is affecting them but it's so badly written & acted it just ends up being boring. the film starts with isabelle already possessed so we never knew what she was like as a normal person so we never really care about her or what is happening to her either, the rest of the character's are poorly written & fleshed out. at times i wondered whether blackwater valley exorcism was a spoof, there's a silly scene in which a vet tries to sedate the possessed isabelle with horse tranquilisers & after he states that she needs a 'little prick' he enters her room with a huge needle hidden behind his back! there are a few scenes in which people are punched accompanied by a silly comedy sound effect. the film has an uneven tone as a result as it goes between silly spoof & serious horror drama, or it did in my opinion at least.according to some text before the opening credits blackwater valley exorcism was based on 'actual events', yeah right actual events from 1973 that happened in a film called the exorcist... this piece of text also states that the exorcism scenes were supervised by a real priest. there isn't even any decent gore or exploitation to liven things up, there's a scene of a cut arm, there's a dead dog, someone is stabbed with a crucifix & that's about it. there's surprisingly no bad language in it either despite the demon trying to be offencive. i would imagine the only reason blackwater valley exorcism has an adult rating is because of one very brief scene in which a pair of breast's are seen. one pair of naked female breast's is not worth the time watching this or the money you might spend on it. there is zero scares, no atmosphere & a really amateurish feel to the whole film too.with a supposed budget of about $1,000,000 i must say that i am wondering where all the money went, the film looks ugly & cheap throughout. there are no special effects to speak of & the production values are rock bottom. the acting is very poor from all involved, genre favourite jeffrey combs gets near top billing during the opening credits but has nothing more than a cameo in what amounts to about five minutes of screen time. even he must have feared how bad this was going to be has he hides behind a moustache & a terrible accent, he is better than this.blackwater valley exorcism is a complete rip-off of the exorcist without anything that made that film such a classic & the makers are thirty five years too late anyway. a total turkey from start to finish.

this movie had very few moments of real drama. after the opening minutes the film descended in a spiral that didn't quite take us to hell and back - viewing was pure purgatory to say the least. the acting was more horrendous than the subject matter of the film and at times i couldn't stop laughing. the continuity between some of the scenes was dire - characters disappeared from scenes without explanation only to be replaced by other characters who minutes earlier had been some where else. surely this was a spoof of the exorcist. the collection plate at the church must have been full of copper the day mr russo signed up for this one. do i speak latin? et tu brutus.

i have to agree with the previous reviewer. although the kristin erikson did a great job of playing the possessed girl, i seriously don't think that isabelle, the character she was playing, was possessed. i have seen people have psychotic breaks due to sexual abuse, and they never made it clear whether or not the father had actually abused her or not. i also had to watch some parts of it over again, to make it clear as to what the letter said, what the characters' names were, and i'm still not clear on a few things that happened, whether they were real or not. i'm trying to find the "original" story that it was based on, to compare facts, but i can't seem to find anything about it online.it wasn't a bad movie, but some of the dialogue was incredibly cheesy. special effects wise, the movie wasn't bad for a grade b, pretty much, and those possession scenes made it all worth while... that is, if you have nothing better to do. lol

even worse then the incredibly boring "the exorcism of emily rose". it started off decently, and right up until the mom said to the dad, "see i knew she was possessed", in an i told you so voice. it was a terrible line, spoken badly and it foreshadowed the rapid demise of this amazingly bad movie. every family member has an issue from the past with the priest. the dad starts to accuse everyone of either liking his wife, or actually having an affair with her, culminating with him killing his buddy, then himself in the obvious instant lucidity after he realizes his friend hadn't slept with his wife after all. people are dying, others are coming under possession, and by this point most viewers don't even care anymore. except for their employee miguel, none of the characters in this movie was actually likable, making it hard to care, about any of them. the acting was terrible and the writing even worse. glad i saw it for free; although i feel that for a movie this bad someone owes me money for the time i lost.

ok, i normally don't add comments on movies, but i finally watched a movie that was so utterly full of bullsh*t and riddled with incompetence that i just had to warn people about. blackwater valley exorcist is loosely about a wife-beating/pederast/priest and this podunk family of horse freaks, and to make a long story short the youngest daughter who was molested by the priest but in love with the hillbilly ranch hand gets possessed. along with a heroic god shunning mexican gardener who once participated in a exorcism, the wife-beating/ pederast/priest manage to save the day, but not before the possessing demon is able to jump over to a hooker who the town sheriff made blow him. all in all this movie is the biggest pile of useless (i could get very descriptive with this part but why waste my energy on this movie)sh*t i've ever seen. any and all persons associated with the making of this movie should be sterilized so that they cannot pollute the earth with their useless spawn.

a girl named isobel becomes possessed by a demon. the local priest (who formerly dated isobel's sister) must try to save her, but the bigger problems are with the family's suspicions of each other rather than the demon in their daughter.this film is directed by ethan wiley, the writer of "house" and the writer/director of "house ii". i loved the first film and liked the second one even better, so you would think this would be a winner. alas, this one looks like it was thrown together by first-year film students. dawson leery could have done better. i have thought about blaming new writer ellary eddy, especially because the idea is hardly original (are they trying to cash in on the fans of "the exorcism of emily rose"?), but wiley should have been able to do his magic.also, you'd like to think veteran horror stars jeffrey combs and james russo would help this film. russo (playing the bishop) barely shows up, and combs has a great role as a sheriff... for the five minutes he's on screen (but i love the mustache). so, no help here.after seeing "the exorcist", all other exorcism films must be compared to the classic by default, no? and the demonic possession in this film was not scary in the least. no head-spinning or paranormal activity at all. just a girl with a deep voice and runny makeup. all the "demonic" stuff was centered around the father accusing everyone of sleeping with his wife. as another reviewer wrote, "you get a lot of isobel bouncing on her bed like it's a trampoline, hiding in her closet, and jumping from a hay-loft. yeah, it's chuck e. cheese gone wild." that sadly sums up the extent of the "evil" in this movie.if you want to watch a movie about family members who invent accusations and yell at each other while the possessed daughter sits in another room off-camera, this is the movie for you. but, if you don't mind my saying so, you have a horrible taste in film if this is what you're seeking.the plot seems to focus on the father accusing a cowboy of sleeping with his wife (who didn't, but did sleep with his daughter) and of the veterinarian of sleeping with his wife (who might have, but denies it). and then you have a gardener who attacks the possessed girl with a crucifix and tells the family to call an exorcist, but once the priest arrives the gardener declares he does not believe in god. what was all the bible-quoting you were doing five minutes ago?a horrible exorcism movie. horribler examples of what combs and russo are capable of. and such a sad display of directing after the "house" series of films became classic. i would like to pretend wiley had no part in making this shamefully derivative and unoriginal, uninspired film. the power of christ compels you to avoid this movie as if viewing it were a cardinal sin.

this movie was probably one of the worst movies i've seen in a very long time. a friend of mine grabbed it off the shelf at the video rental store, and all but forced me to watch it, an action we both deeply regret. ehh... where to start? the writing, the acting, the quality? all of it, sucked. quite possibly some of the worst writing ever displayed in a movie. the dialog was worse than i thought it could ever be in the movies. blatant dialog, such as "how ya doing?"..."not that great, doc" (directly after an attempted exorcism of a man's daughter and then his wife's attempted suicide. of course he's not that great.) was, at some points, kind of funny. if not horribly written, planned out, and obvious. the general plot of the movie, the writing and the way it worked, horrible. it was like the writers could come up with nothing better to do then write a bunch of crappy dialog and throw in as many sex and nudity scenes as they randomly could. the only almost good sex scene (between the preacher and the tattooed & peirced girl) was filmed with such poor quality that it looked more like a cheap porno than a feature film. oh yeah, and they never actually got the deed done.the acting? horrible. x100. i think the only good actor was the short spanish guy who played miguel, del zamora. and his part was written horribly. the worst acting? arguably paul kappellas, whose acting combined with shitty music, a gun, and a half naked bluish white girl running around in the woods made the movie almost unbearable to sit through. he even screwed up his own death scene, one that should have been easy to nail. although, most everybody else's acting was horrible as well.the lack of characters also added to the overall suck level of the movie. there were just enough characters so that almost half of the characters died, that same amount of people became possessed at one point, and then the remaining characters couldn't be counted on one hand. like... 50 thumbs down.p.s. what is it with the climax of exorcism movies happening in a stable, anyways?

i'm not sure if this is a comedy or not, but i found it pretty comical. isobel is possessed by the devil. somehow a perverted priest and the gardener are gonna' fix that. part exorcism and part soap opera, you'll at least get some laughs. there's the paranoid jealous dad, satanic sister, valley of the dolls mother, and then the cowboy boyfriend; all there to help the skirt chasing priest fight the demons from dear isobel. it sometimes felt like a jerry springer episode, but i actually paid to see this. instead of the cool head-twisting, sailor cursing, and crucifix humping that regan did in the exorcist; you get a lot of isobel bouncing on her bed like it's a trampoline, hiding in her closet, and jumping from a hay-loft. yeah, it's chuck e. cheese gone wild. so, if you want to watch a quote unquote horror film that is worth a few laughs while you wait for the predictable ending ... this is your movie.

the movie started very well..so far isabelle's exorcism could be believed....but later, gosh!!! i didn't know if it was a horror movie, a drama one or a must not see one! the possessed creature attacking the sheriff had no connection at all with the movie....the make up!! well it looked pretty real at beginning, but at the end, last part of movie, the make up (especially teeth and eyes) was very exaggerated. if you want a good "exorcism" movie watch "the exorcism of emily rose".together with "hard candy" (totally boring, pathetic plot and ending), these two movies are the worst i've seen from lionsgate!! but well the movie company has given horror movie fans excellent films, but with this one, you will wish you never rent it!! exorcism movie fans, just stay with two "the exorcist" and "emily rose's exorcism"

i just rented blackwater valley exorcism because the cover and pictures looked terrifying, and i don't normally watch movies that are automatically released onto dvd, but this looked so interesting and scary! i was very much in the mood for a good scary film and to me, possession is one of the scariest subjects to watch or learn about. just look at the exorcist or the exorcism of emily rose, both terrific movies that made break-throughs not only horror wise, but story as well.blackwater valley exorcism is about a girl, isabelle, who from the get go is automatically possessed, so we can't even tell what kind of a person she was to begin with. but a former wife beater turned priest is on the case with a gardener...? i know... i know. then they go into several other stories with the priest and isabella's sister, and the priest hit the sister and messed around with isabelle? i'm not sure, then we get into a story with isabelle's dad and his questioning of his wife's faithfulness to him.i mean, the story just goes into too many directions and wasn't well developed at all. not to mention that the exorcism didn't seem authentic at all and more of a just scare your pants off type of a film, which i didn't like at all because i couldn't take it seriously. whoever directed and wrote this clearly had no idea where to go or how to direct the story well, so i wouldn't really recommend this.2/10

documentaries about fans are always mishmashes, and never worth seeing through, but i found this one, made by some of the fans themselves, more than usually unenlightening. as a veteran of the original tolkien craze, forty years ago, i'd hoped for more than the obvious--which doesn't always equate to the true. if there's anyone living who doesn't already know the nature of a fandom, any fandom, from having been or known a fan, he won't discover it here. between irrelevancies, platitudes (to which the actors from the films are particularly prone), and acting out (by fans making the most--if not the best--of their one shot at fame), i could glean little of the special appeal of lotr, the special emotional responses it evokes, and the range of the special creative forms those responses can take. in addition, the film is rather lazy: it slights some facts that could have been got across with little effort, e.g. what the exact legal loophole was (the wording of a copyright notice) that permitted the books' unauthorized publication in the u.s. (speaking of which: i take strong exception to the film's dismissal of the covers on that edition as "irrelevant" and "psychedelic," which they were not. they were the work of jack gaughan, a very able sf illustrator of the period, and some fans, including me, found them more apt, and more attractive, than the covers on the rival set.)

dante would of been mortified, if he knew that his masterpiece was being acted out puppets!!! also the actors who played the puppets are sell outs. due to the fact that playing a puppet is not acting it is just basically doing nothing. no one really will care who the puppet was. people only care who played a major role in like an actual movie. this is just annoying how you could mock such an amazing man and his belief, by this dumb little movie. this should be a crime and.... i cant believe you would ruin a book like that. i thought the movie was absolutely ridiculous and should be destroyed!!!! it totally ruins what your suppose to be getting from reading it. your just making it a big joke.

this demented left-wing wipe-out trivializes dante's great work, distorts the genius of the author out of all recognition, inserts hateful ideology, incompetent satire and moronic political commentary in every imaginable place, and itself deserves a place in the eighth circle, tenth bolgia with the rest of the falsifiers. sandow birk has reserved himself a spot next to it.stocking hell with republican political figures, fox news helicopters and christian conservatives is a work of literary sacrilege, to say nothing of extreme liberal bias. it is, however, unoriginal, tedious and trite. nothing in birk's unworthy and heretical revision is in the least relevant to the original text or is in any way entertaining, humorous or enlightening, despite his smug pretension to the contrary. i could have eaten a reel of video tape and puked a better movie. i regret the two hours of my life that i lost watching this insult to the very concept of poetry. calliope will weep forever.

i was surprised to discover michael moore or bill maher wasn't involved with this "movie". an american leftist laundry list of axes to grind, with a distinct sparseness of democrats in hell. mao zedong and karl marx didn't make an appearance in hell, but ronald reagan is in the same room with hitler? perhaps we'll have to wait for these california spin doctors to butcher paradiso for them to show all of their pet ideologue political figures.cheap shots at religion, right-wing politicians, corporations and their lobbyists, fox news, even suvs. all the radical leftist talking points were too completely covered - while conspicuously omitting references to wrongdoing from the "other side of the aisle" - to not have been a conscious effort. the singular exception i noticed, in the hour and a half, is jfk has to have sex with marilyn monroe for eternity: the token inclusion in these propaganda pieces in a pathetic attempt at appearing non-partisan.

a group of young filmmakers with virtually no budget set out to make something clever and original -- and while there is a bit of originality and some skilled drawing in this slacker puppet show take on "dante's inferno," there is nothing especially clever. dante's "divine comedy" was a brilliant piece of social commentary. this film is a vaguely moralistic student film with pretensions to high art.i suspect those who loved this film were those readily amused by the sophomoric pokes at some icons of the political and/or religious right, and that those who hated it took offense at seeing their favored icons poked. be that as it may, few of those pokes actually rose to the level of satire.the high point of the movie is a sudden outbreak of "schoolhouse rock" on the subject of lobbying and the "revolving door." it's really a shame that the entire film couldn't have been a musical. that would have stripped away a great deal of the annoying film school pretentiousness and added a far stronger element of fun.

kubrick may have been the greatest director of all times. he may have made more classics than anyone else. he may have been a perfectionist. but man, was his first attempt ever bad!kubrick had good reason to try to make this film dissappear from the map: it looks like an ed wood film. it has strange narration, cheap shots, bad dialogue, ominous music reminiscent of your 50s sci-fi/horror flick, and what looks like relatives of the cast of "reefer madness" going insane for no reason.sure, you can see an undeveloped kubrick in there. it is a psychological/horror study of war. the characters became dehumanized and insane. there are people playing more than one role. there are constant shots of the faces and particular facial expressions of different people. and there are a few interesting shots around there. but really, this is a mess.of course, i am not discouraging you from watching it. if you get a hold of it, you are joining a select group of myself and a few thousand people world wide who have had access to it.

fear and desire is of interest mainly to kubrick obsessives, who can plumb this pretentious clap trap for signs of his still-to-come greatness. kubrick was right in seeking to ensure that the film was not screened or available on legitimate video. he considered it embarrassing and amateurish, and he was correct in his evaluation. this is a weak and tedious film--at 68 minutes it still seems longer than "barry lyndon"!--it nevertheless is of historical interest, and has its genuine absorbing moments. it's a difficult film to find (only "unofficial" copies are in circulation), though perhaps this may change if kubrick's estate relents and has it released on video. recommended only for kubrick enthusiasts.

stanley kubrick, a director who i hold in the highest of esteems for his masterpieces (clockwork orange, 2001, the killing, the shining, dr. strangelove, etc) took the film out of circulation, leaving it to be found by only the hardcore fans and completists. after seeing the film for myself, i could see why. at the age of 24, kubrick had already honed his craft of still photography for look magazine, and had done a few short documentaries. like many first-time filmmakers that came in the decades after him, his ambition for fear and desire was, in short, to just go and make a film, cheaply, more than likely to see if he could do it. on that level, he was successful. however, the film itself definitely is not.i can't really say that the film is a failure because there was something i did like about it throughout. even as the film's story went on the wayside, and the actors (whom kubrick didn't have any idea how to direct, not being a man of the theater), his knack for producing and capturing some great images gets its seeds in this film. at times, there are some shots of close-ups and quick-shots in suspense/action scenes that are eye-catching. unfortunately, this is all the good i can really say of the film. although there are a couple of 'name' actors in the film (frank slivera, who also appeared in killer's kiss, and paul mazursky, a director in his own right), the performances overall are dull and very routine.in fact, that is the film's main demise for me; whenever i watch any kubrick film, even his early film noirs killer's kiss and the killing, i can tell who made it, as his style by then became distinct, which would continue as he evolved as an artist. it wasn't 'artsy' like i might have pictured (which is usually the case with first-time directors like scorsese and spielberg), but watching this film not only did it feel like it wasn't kubrick, it felt like a lot of the time i was watching some b (or even c) grade movie by a director that time forgot- not quite 'ed wood' bad, but close. the music is as standard as can be, the fades are pedestrian, and the plot seems to not really hold that much attention.in short, as others have said and which i can agree, this is a "doodle pad" of a future ground-breaker, who shows some shots and a few edits that grab some attention (the best scene overall being when the soldiers take the dumb girl hostage), but not enough to really recommend except to those, like myself, who end up seeing everything by kubrick (or, perhaps, have to see every ultra-low budget war film ever made), if only out of curiosity.

this sickly sweet and laboriously paced 5-reeler is definitely not among harold lloyd's better films. gags are sparse and mostly uninspired. saccharine melodrama is abundant. the setup takes forever, as lloyd, the unconventional, but impossibly kindly, country doctor makes his rounds, bringing a little sunshine into the lives of children, the elderly, and puppies. it's like a 1922 version of patch adams. ugh. 4/10.

it's another variation on the oft-told tale of two people getting married and having to share their brood of kids. with six you get egg roll is directed by howard morris (from television) and it shows, because it's the kind of tale that plays like a half-hour situation comedy padded out to feature film length--but with a scarcity of laughs, or to put it differently, only the number of laughs that would have been possible within the half-hour limits of a tv show.doris day decided to call it quits after this film--and it's rather easy to see why. even the presence of some fairly reliable actors in the cast doesn't help. brian keith, barbara hershey, pat carroll and alice ghostley do their best, but the script is the real problem and should have been left untouched for the big screen.nothing much can be said in favor of it. skip it and see miss day in any number of her more worthwhile films.

and obviously i didn't see it! but looking at the cast and seeing that doug masters is back from the dead, i know now to avoid this like the plague! i hate it when hollywood, producers, writers, directors or all of the above think that audiences are stupid that they're not going to catch continuity errors. a supposedly dead doug masters returning is a big giant one, won't you say?and i can't believe that someone like louis gossett, jr. would return for something like that.did jason gedrick really decline this? well, i hate to say it, but even if he took the role again, it would have still had that same continuity error. i bet (if he really turned it down), he must have been incredulous seeing that his character died in the second film.i'll probably catch it by accident on a late night air on some channel, but no way am i going to rent this or buy the dvd!

louis gossett jr returns to the well one more time as chappy sinclair who goes to doug masters (played by jason cadieux who is in for jason gedrick who wisely declined) to teach a new band of recruits however this time they discover corrupt air force pilots who deal in toxic waste. this is a series that just keeps getting worse with each subsequent entry, this one however doesn't have any of the zip or even the action to make this even worth seeing on cable. iron eagle iv is directed with such indifference that the dogfights come off as if we were watching a playstation 2 game played by two lobotomized teenagers. it is horrendous to watch and gossett jr who has made his share of turkeys seems to have bottomed out here. and i saw cover-up, firewalker, aces:iron eagle iii, toy soldiers and jaws 3d. what is mysterious about louis gossett jr is that he seems to be like christopher walken in his quest to do anything as long as he's working. as i look at his post oscar win. some of his better movies include iron eagle, the punisher and the principal. considering that the latter two movies have him co-starring with dolph lundgren and james belushi it is indeed something to say that three guilty pleasure action flicks are in the running for his better work. of course enemy mine and diggstown remain his best post-oscar win work.* out of 4-(bad)

whomever thought of having sequels to iron eagle must be shot. in this case once was enough. iron eagle was a good movie to watch. even though it is unrealistic, it is still entertaining. iron eagle ii has a senseless plot and can be used to as a cure to insomnia. i didn't even bother to watch iron eagle iii, but from looking at the r rating, i assume it's more violent than the past 2 movies. well, iron eagle iv is probably the most inane sequel. lou gossett jr. returns as the always delightful "chappy" sinclair. another jason returns to fill the role of doug masters (canadian jason cadieux, who looks just like jason gedrick from the first iron eagle). but wait(here comes a possible spoiler).....wasn't doug killed in iron eagle ii? the writers must've been desprate for a story so they revived doug masters by saying he was a prisoner of the russians. this movie was the cheapest done of all the iron eagle films. why do movie makers find it neccessary to make sequels to unappealing movies? (ex. police academy movies). i have always liked gossett jr.'s work in these films. he was the only one holding this turkey together. let's hope this was the last of the iron eagle sequels. let it rest in peace.

this is a slick little movie well worth your time to find and see.it really speaks to all those mundane choices we all make every day and (like an h.g. welles story i can't quite recall) may live to want back.keep in mind that this is a short (very short). it starts out slowly but just as you begin to think it has become boring =bang= it's over. and, believe me, the 'punch line' is one you will remember.i'm not sure if the producers are going to make it available for purchase - or available on the web but either way you'd be happy you took the time to get hold of a copy - of that i am sure.

are you kidding me? the music was so loud in this show i could often not even hear the dialog. and the music was nothing great. anyone know what jake's mother said when he walked in the door??? and the mushroom cloud looked pretty close to have so little instant devastation. anyone research the effects of nuclear fallout before writing this one. i felt like a bunch of sit com actors were sent on location and didn't know what to do with dramatic dialog. and what does a kansas teen know about shopping in soho....couldn't we have had a better line here? was bored to tears and only kept awake by the jarring blare of the over-mixed way to loud music.

a family (a teenage boy, his mother and a stepdad), sick of city life, decides to move to the mountains to get away from it all and have a fresh start. however, their idyll is shattered by three brothers and their domineering father, who don't take kindly to newcomers on their patch. while having objects thrown through their window and being threatened in the street is just the start, the youth decides to make things even worse by having a relationship with the terrible trio's sister. with the law unwilling to do anything about it and the violence escalating rapidly, the lad decides to take matters into his own hands..veering wildly between hilarity and nastiness, this is one of the oddest exploitation movies ever made. at first, you can have a chuckle at some of the hammy acting and ludicrous dialogue given to the characters, especially the overwrought bad guys. but then, you get completely unnecessary scenes like a mother being raped while her son is forced to watch, or the thug's sister getting herself beaten up by her siblings for daring to sleep with our young hero. in fact, the whole view of women in the movie, which seems to be that they're pathetic creatures who scream a lot and can't defend themselves, is pretty despicable. but of course, there's the obligatory nude scene, which this time involves a young lady diving into a pool bra-less under a very thin t-shirt. who cares about plot consistency when you have some willing young starlets ready to shed her togs. right?!the climax centres on the teenager, who up until now hasn't been able to sneeze without jumping, suddenly morphing into a rambo clone and blowing off his assailants left, right and centre to save his stepfather who is being held hostage by the gang. it's completely implausible but hey, so is everything else in this film.. so at least you can't accuse it of not being consistent. so, rather than attempting to find logic in a place where the word doesn't exist, check out the imdb pages for janet laine green, dehl berti, stephen hunter, jonathan crombie.. etc. notice a pattern emerging here? their careers all hit dead ends. why? sit through this, and all will become clear. remember kids, if you want to get ahead in this business, hire a decent agent and always read the scripts they offer you. please.. 3/10

olivia d'abo in a wet t-shirt is the only thing this movie has going for it. other than that, this canadian production about a man taking out a vicious band of hillbillies is not worth anybody's time. the writing is bad, the acting is poor and the direction is sub-standard.

lonesome jim is kind of like a romantic dark comedy about a dysfunctional family whose two boys are total losers. both boys around 30, living at home, with absolutely nothing going for them. i live in the midwest and i can't name one family like this. i picked it up because i kind of like buscemi acting humor. now i realize i need to have a counteracting agent to that humor to make it work. the acting and camera work and editing was fine. the first 15 minutes got you set, and the last 15 minutes helped prevent the film from being totally depressing jerry springer trailer trash type of story. the female members of my family were begging me to turn it off, but i prevailed under the premise that there had to be a turning point near the end, and we watched the entire movie. the male family members, as expected, simply walked out after the first 30 minutes.

i was attracted to this film by its offbeat, low-key, 'real life' story line. that is, a twenty-something guy flops in the big apple and comes back home to live with his parents and even more floppy brother. it just might have worked but there's a problem. and that problem's name is casey affleck. casey affleck is nearly catatonic in this film. his acting mantra must be "exert as little effort as possible at all times". or "why speak when you can mutter?" or maybe "put yourself into a coma as soon as the camera rolls". lips moving when speaking? barely. facial expressions? none. muscles in face? atrophied. something? nothing. anything? zip.

the only time i seem to trawl through imdb comments is when i've seen a duff film. i guess i'm looking to find reassurance that it's not just me. for me, then, lonesome jim was a duff film packed with unbelievable characters in unbelievable situations which limped on lamely and boringly towards a cop-out hackneyed conclusion. so i check out what other people have to say and feel a bit like jim, out on a limb, alienated, as page after page of multiple star ratings and plaudits leave me doubting my critical faculties. yet maybe i should check the settings for the comments presentation, since after a while the gushing dies down and i'm relieved to see appreciations that mirror my own. i feel vindicated. it is a rubbish film, it doesn't hang together and it does constitute a wasted evening sitting through it. praise be to kindred spirits.

whilst this is most definitely a well crafted piece of film-making, it's thoroughly without any entertainment value whatsoever.if you're depressed already, this film will send you over the edge.if you're feeling somewhat depressed, this film will be just one more thing in your life to feel bitter about. you'll feel that it's just your luck to have chosen to watch a movie that turns out to be a complete waste of time.otherwise you might be able to make it through this film unscathed (i didn't, btw), safe in the knowledge that your life is so much better than jim's. then again you might consider that you have been fooling yourself, and that are in fact in a much worse situation than you'd previously realized. you might feel a bit annoyed at jim for bringing this to your attention. you may want to slap him around a bit with a wet fish. the sad truth is, much as i wanted to like this movie... i hated it. it took rather a long miserable road down the path of oblivion and then suddenly, for no reason whatsoever, looked back at itself and then stopped.jim does not have an epiphany, at least not one that is conveyed on screen. jim has a miserable life and a miserable set of options. he discovers nothing that one can relate to and fails to make any significant progress on his journey of self-discovery. of course no-one alive could write a happy ending to this movie. as others have said it's no hollywood tale, it's gritty and it's real. it's well made. life is quite a struggle at times. if anyone were to know "the answer", they do well to shout it from the rooftops.still, i feel cheated because this movie pretends to have something to say. you feel that it's going to say something, that if you just suffer through a little more of it, it'll have something to say. it'll make you stop and think. it doesn't.again, i do submit that this is a well crafted film. and therefore may be of value to a film student with a penchant for e.g. lighting techniques of the use of colour palettes. for the rest of us, it's utterly miss-able.

i like steve buscemi. i like his work very much, both as an actor and a director. you could say that i am -into- steve buscemi. a steve buscemi freak. i lurv steve buscemi.i remember when i first saw buscemi's full length directorial debut, "trees lounge." i enjoyed the movie, although it wasn't as good as it could have been. it was -almost- there. it -almost- scratched that itch, the itch of wanting to see "small" movies about "small" people in "small" bars that are in "small" towns. it was close enough to where i would say that it was a very good movie - one that with a few tweaks could have been great. but that's ok. i like the movie and i've watched it more than once.but this review is not about trees lounge. it's about "lonesome jim." when i saw the description of the movie and then i saw who's movie it was, i was excited at the prospect of finally seeing the movie that i knew that trees lounge could have been. but what i actually experienced was not unlike that of leaving one of those smalltown bars with a belly full of cheap whiskey and an armful of cheap floozy, heading back to your apartment with a mushy brain full of exciting prospects that inevitably disintegrate into the reality of alcohol-induced impotence and headspinning regurgitation.in other words, this movie left me flat and unrequited and sorry that i wasted the time and the money that it took me to get to that state - the film equivalent of waking up next to that cheap floozy the next morning, or if you happen to be the floozy, waking up next to that stinking and farting and unshaven imbecile. the film had all of the substance of a stale white bread sandwich (with store brand white bread, no less) and the emotion of a cadaver. i am not sure what the point of this film was, and since it was supposed to have some sort of a point and was not an exercise in abstract surrealism that can get by without one then this lack of a point is a sin of omission. sorta like those new cars that don't come with ashtrays anymore although there are millions of people who smoke and buy new cars (i'm not one of them, but hey, i can sympathize). overall it was a boring film about boring people doing boring things and had none of the grit and believability that can carry and save such a film. i mean, trees lounge was about boring people doing boring things, but it was interesting. i blame a lot of this on affleck. why do people keep casting these affleck turds? they suck the life out of anything that they are connected with. one affleck was in one decent film (and wasn't even the reason why the film was decent) and all of the sudden every butthole named affleck is stinking up as many films as they possibly can. and liv tyler is no better. being the daughter of a rock star does not necessarily make an actress. she is as lifeless as affleck. these people simply do not rise from the flat page of the script. people pay to see films and they deserve to see actors and actresses with a bit of charisma - these two duds together don't have the spark of the old guy who hands out shopping carts at wal mart. i always thought that steve buscemi was the type of guy who would rise above this type of pablum, but oh steve you let us down. this film makes me want to stuff you into another wood chipper.

i am sitting here writing this review and the movie's not even over yet. in fact, i just checked, and there are 45 more minutes to go. but no matter, there's no need to see it through to the end. i'll just write this review and laugh as the film plays in the background and stumbles onward to some kind of presumably horrible conclusion which i don't care to ever see or know.what accounts for my hostility to this movie? the characters are not believable. the plot is not believable. the pretentiousness of the movie is sickening. basically, every element of the movie rings false. buscemi obviously thought he had something to add to the dozens of movies which have already explored the well-worn themes of dysfunctional families and the apparent meaninglessness of life. however, buscemi was badly mistaken, because this movie contains nothing new. it tries very hard to be depressing, but fortunately no one can really be depressed by it, because it's obvious that no people like this exist in the entire world.what is depressing however is the knowledge that somehow this film was voted several undeserved awards. disgusting!!!! bottom line: stay away from this worthless film at all costs.

i wasn't able to last ten minutes on the this terrible film. in and age of dv cameras, it looks to have been shot on vhs without aid of any color correction or microphone.as a filmmaker myself, i know the constraints of indy film-making and, even keeping those things in mind, i'm amazed films can be made this poorly.the only praise i can offer is that this film got distribution as i've seen considerably better films still seeking modest domestic or international release. i'm guessing the box is what sold it...it does have good box art, but it all goes downhill from there.side note: it seems the director has 11 friends since no one on the this planet would give this film a "10".

a friend of mine showed me this film yesterday, and i was really amazed that someone could make a movie this terrible! mix the most awful, clichéd dialog, with the most wooden acting you've ever seen, with the cheesiest special effects know to man, and you get this magnificent beast!'vampire assassins' is funnier than most comedies i've seen, it really is awful! i was in stitches during the scene where the ex cop/vampire assassin character is having coffee with the internet journalist. just watch it and you'll see what i mean!i honestly can't believe that someone made this with serious intentions.tragic, but a really good laugh. it has to be seen to be believed.

i don't normally give movies a "1." although i am a heartless critic, i try to find anything that makes the movie worthwhile (that is to say, watchable). the main thing i look for is a coherent plot. if it has that alone, i can watch it! let me start by saying, this doesn't even deserve to be called a movie, this is more like an elementary school project...gone horribly wrong! and i've seen every sci-fi movie special that was ever made.many times i've read professional critic reviews that say crap like "this played like a made-for-tv...(etc, etc)" and i kept saying "oh come on, i wish they'd think of a real criticism." well this is worse...much worse! this is truly the worst "thing" i've seen that's lasted the length of a movie (if i did consider it a movie it would be my new worst movie of all time), and i've seen every movie uwe boll made! this movie makes uwe boll look like francis ford coppola! :) i'd rather watch jaws the revenge all day then see this one more time...even 5 minutes of it...there was one good scene and it was the end! ;-p ok enough bashing the works of ron hall, now for the serious criticism.the script is poorly written, the dialog is delivered in a wooden manner, the effects are cheesier than those in a power rangers show, and don't even get me started on the screen zoom-in transitions (ugh). someone actually watched this thing, edited it, and then said, "ok release it"? i would have rather burned this than release it! in closing all i can say is "thank goodness dvd and vhs players have a stop and eject feature!" my advice...don't rent it, if you do, you'll be glad you have stop and eject too! :)

so, this is the worst movie you will probably ever see. it's up there with "crossbones" and "southern comfort", but if your a bad movie fan like i am, this atrocity of a film will be the most fun you've had in years. why does the camera make old-school kung fu noises when it zooms? why does that random guy stuff a nascar commemorative plate in his bag? and who is he anyway? why do the vampires shoot lightning after they die? what is this? highlander? dracula mccloud? who cares! just laugh at it. this movie has no continuity, no plot, no anything, really. ron hall's range of emotions are always off. he looks happy when he should be sad, angry when he should be confused. the rest of the cast couldn't act their way out of a paper bag. the special ("short bus" kinda special) effects are randomly placed, and never needed. most scenes are lit with a desk lamp, if they are lit at all. mel novak has the audacity to look off-camera for his line, and it's not even edited out. they just keep on filming. in fact, half of this movie isn't even on film at all. it's 1/2 film, 1/2 sony hand-cam. for most of the film it seems that they left their boom mike at home. this movie doesn't just have a few plot holes, it's a mine field of confusion and mental pain! but oh do i love it! thank you ron hall, for this cinematic abomination. i went out and bought it, cause it's just so damn funny. ($1.99 on amazon, and i had it rush delivered!)"i have weapons! i have weapons! i have weapons!"

if you came here, it's because you've already seen this film and were curious what others had to say about it.i feel for you, i *really* do. and i profusely apologize as a canadian (because that's what we do) that this film ever had to cross your eyes, if only for a moment. i hear there is no cure for the retinal bleeding reported out of every dozen cases.i, like everyone else, rented this movie believing it to be some stupid b-movie ripoff of blade. i thought, "sure i could use a good laugh at a stupid movie." i'll give the creators of this film one positive comment about their 'creation': thanks for removing the rec xx/xx/xx from the bottom right-hand corner of the screen. i can see how that would have been a distraction from seeing this movie.and for the record, i *saw* the movie, but did not watch it. the dialogue was incoherent and most of the scenes took place in my grandmother's trailer, i swear to god.you know what? i'm not writing anymore about this. it's just too painful.

ok, normally i am fascinated by z movies. some of the actors, directors, writers, etc. in those movies have a shred of talent. they want to get that talent out so unfortunately for them, they have to associate with crappy people to make their films. but some z films do have at least one thing that may be noteworthy about them.not here.as soon as i saw it i thought...'wow, a blade knock-off.' believe me, if this movie could have lived up to that label that would have made it a better movie.instead i was subjected to some of the most horrible acting i have ever seen in my life. master kao was bad, so bad that i believe some of my neurons in my brain exploded trying to comprehend his acting. i am still trying to make sense of his enunciation and why he would raise his voice in speaking certain words...to add dramatic effect i'm sure...but it was for no apparent reason. simply mind boggling.oh and then there is the black guy in the purple cape near the end of the movie. purple cape guy fights the hero for about 30 seconds, but he is so bad that it actually looked like he was scared of fighting.the main hero and the main villain did decent jobs. the main hero (derek washington) seemed like he actually knew martial arts.

this movie was pathetically awful. the sound was terrible, the action was ridiculous and the effects were nauseating. if you have a life don't see this movie, cause you will want to kill yourself. this movie totally rips off blade (which is undoubtedly a really good movie...or trilogy i should say).i don't care who the actors are, this movie is just horrible. i watched 10 minutes of it and had to come to my computer and comment on how absolutely just bad this movie is. i actually don't know why my family is still watching it...oh wait, yes i do. they are laughing almost non-stop at the stupid action, dialogue and acting.

this movie has got to go down in the history of bad movies as the worst one i've ever seen. it wasn't even a bad b movie...i would have rated it at as a z. the special effects were ridiculous...err if you could even call them special effects. i think the reviewer before hit the nail on the head...it was the box that sold the movie, while the cover art was great and the synopsis intriguing (which both is why i rented it) it was a waste of not only time but money as well. i didn't last long. i took it back to the store and switched it out for another movie i believe my local video store took it off the shelf because they had soooo many complaints about this horrible movie. my 6 year old could have done a better job filming it/writing the script!

i hope the people who made this movies read these comments. the choreography was horrid, the plot was nill, and the actors where so low budget power rangers appears 5 star to this junk.the fight scenes where so slow you could actually see the actors waiting for each other to perform the next move. camera cut-aways and poor lighting could not cover up the cheap effects. the lightning was just plain stupid. the weapons looked like something out of a final fantasy game, and the dual bow and arrow was just dull as anything i have ever seen.next movie you decide to make try investing in some wireless mics, better script and try actually spending some time on your stunts.honestly there are shows on t.v. that play ever night and are thrown together in a few hours that look better than this one.stick to martial arts (unless its as poor as your acting) then take up quilting.

as i said, sometimes low budget is good. you get to see a good movie without a lot of the extra bs that can hide an otherwise piece of crap. well...this was that piece of crap. if anything, i thought it had humor, unfortunately the humor was unintentional. the only half-witted acting came from bill smith and his part was cut out (that's a joke). there was never a bill smith, nor was there anyone cast who could act. even gerald okamura sucked, and he's been cast in nearly 40 movies. the fight scenes were comical and made me feel like i could kick all their $%#@#$. the sound was horrible, as if all sound was recorded on the set. my 10 year old could have written a better script...btw, my 10 year old fell asleep...no kidding. i give a b+ to editing for cutting the movie to only 90 minutes...60 minutes would have been an a+.

do not avoid this movie. simply because it is so bad that it is absolutely hilarious. it possibly is the worst movie i have ever seen but it was so bad that my friends and i were able to laugh at every single moment of this film. at times we actually debated whether it was this bad on purpose but we're pretty sure that it is not. characters appear out of nowhere as if they have already been established, the scenery changes mid scene to this warehouse constantly, and the vampire assassin ends up having around 6 climactic fights with enemies before finally getting to the head vampire. you will also be able to enjoy the one and only face of the vampire assassin as he never changes his expression despite his obvious attempts to. so if you want to watch a movie that will make you laugh histerically then i suggest this one as long as you go in with an open mind. don't expect a good movie, expect the worst... and it will be even worse than that. i seriously want to buy this movie and place it atop my comedy movie selection. right next to anchorman.

i would give this a zero if they had that rating. fun was no fun at all. i grew tired of the movie about ten minutes into but endured to the end thinking it had to get better - it did not. the others i watched this movie with also agreed. the acting was annoying. i am tired of jim carey's over the top ham acting. the supporting cast was no better. while this movie was a statement of corporate greed and the plight of the worker who gets stepped on when a large company goes under, the vehicle for this would have been better served another way. i actually disliked the leading characters (dick and jane) so much that their antics were never funny but pathetic. i am trying to recall one scene where i or anyone i was with laughed and cannot. a worthless movie and a total waste of time.

this movie was, perhaps, one of the most unoriginal and unfunny films i've seen in a long, long while. to be fair, i was not expecting some revolutionary comic formula, but i was anticipating to at least be entertained. with such low expectations, how could i manage to be disappointed? jim carrey, possibly my favorite actor (not sarcasm), did little more than tread water in this film. he seems to have temporarily returned to his funny-face-making roots and created a character no different from his fletcher reede from liar liar. this new character, dick harper (a.k.a. fletcher 2.0) is a poorly rendered and miserably written whelp. if you find yourself smiling while watching this pitiful and essentially boring character, it is most likely because carrey is trying so hard to bring a third dimension to him. carrey's outlandish posing becomes humorously awkward--and, ultimately, sad.tea leoni as jane does little more than provide the abbott to carrey's costello. i typically find tea leoni refreshing and underused, but not in this case. jane harper could have been easily played by any actress from age thirty to forty-five, and it is in that non-specificity that the character of jane becomes uninteresting to watch. she simply has no defining trait other than her following of the movie's general theme, which seems to be that... wait, no, this movie has no theme. unless you count "big business is evil" as a theme. i thought that was more of a given.richard jenkins and alec baldwin both deliver believable (though tired) supporting performances, but neither man seems truly invested in the role they're playing. it's very clear that alec baldwin was putting about as much effort into playing his role as the sinister c.e.o. as he puts into eating a sandwich (which he seems to be doing a lot of lately).slight tangent, but has alec baldwin played any roles in the past few years that hasn't required him to be a powerful jerk in a suit? anyway, take my advice if you haven't already witnessed the horror for yourself: save your money. this is the one to catch on hbo in a few months. dick and jane are present, but there's no fun to be had.

unfortunately this is not as good as any of the other films that jim carrey (producing and starring) and brian grazer have worked on together, but bits of it are definitely worth a look for laughs. basically dick harper (carrey) thinks he is being promoted to a better job. that's until the company of dynocorpe sinks and closes down. now dick and his wife jane (téa leoni), and their son of course, are in trouble with money. no matter what they try, they can't raise the kind of money they really want. so they start robbing a few places. and then they decide to rob the guy that set dick up, his ex-boss jack mcallister (alec baldwin). i think the most laughable bits are when carrey's in the elevator singing "i believe i can fly" and the bit when he ties up someone in a robbery, and is speaking with a voice changer (he sounds like a crap robot). okay!

as a big jim carey fan i took my seat in the cinema with optimism. after all, fun with dick and jane appeared to have all the raw materials to make this another carey success. after the opening five minutes of good humour it seemed that this film would provide but it went wrong as soon as the plot kicked in. the idea that a charming, charismatic, top v.i.p employee could suddenly find himself turning up to work in his nearest supermarket is just so hard to believe and then to get your head round the fact that this guy has also become a master criminal is virtually impossible. the actors seem confused with the situation as well. of course, the stereotypical, rich, uncaring head of the operation doesn't struggle one bit to pull off his one dimensional character but for carey and others around him the job is a whole lot harder. one minute dick is seen as a cocky office pro, obsessed with possessions, the next minute he's a bumbling mess who can barely string two words together, and ultimately he becomes a petty thief who is able, quite happily, to put a gun to another man's head. jane is equally confused with her role and her character never really gets going. the idea behind the story is such a good one and it is a shame that this film has not managed to make it work. the odd moment of laugh out loud comedy can be found but it is usually more physical humour than anything witty or clever. carey tries his best in parts to save a sinking ship but his comic talent can never flourish in a character that has so many gaping holes to his personality. carey shines when he is presented with a strong, daring character (man on the moon, the truman show, ace ventura) which this film never presented him with, despite its best efforts.

part of the movie's low rating is the emphasis on unemployment and the suffering we have to endure. while this is good for drama, in comedy, we know the pains it need not be emphasized. as a result fun with dick and jane is not an appropriate title and i was just plain disappointed failing to see any fun with dick and jane. it is true that this is a copy from the movie of the same name, but it fails on the execution and the title was not appropriate for the story line.however, if the movie was retitled to be "the art of the steal" and the emphasis on bungling slapstick comedy more takes on the robbery and the plans to steal (stupidly of course) would have given the movie a major boost. while, at the same time the movie should show the ceo at least in the beginning to be a crook, so it will be easier to project the pains to someone responsible early on and just leave it at that. the movie suffers a viewpoint issue and with that in mind, a comedy cannot work if the viewpoint is not done properly. a scheming husband character who is that of a wile e. coyote on the road runner would be more funny, including the slapstick comedy. but in this case, a steal instead of the capture of the bird with complicate contraptions would be extremely funny here. i mean you can make many of these and put them in the movie. but since the viewpoint was done wrongly, the robbery part had to be limited.you will enjoy the movie the first 15 minutes (during jim carrey's great rise), but to make the problems they had to faced to be more comical since it is a comedy, that is the part that needs a major overhaul. it can be funnier, if problems were faced more like john travolta's civil action during the downfall. that movie was a serious one but the problems they faced were somewhat comical.

i thought the movie was sub-par. the acting was good but not great, the story was funny but did not come out that way. the director dropped the ball on this movie. it was not james (jim) or tea. imho it was the music that killed it. there is a scene where things go down hill and jonny cash music is playing - man was that depressing (not funny) killed my mood. after that the movie could not recover. the deportation scene had potential funny situation, good acting good set up - i even smirked but the music again was unsuited to the scene. the music kept me from being pulled in to the movie.i say it had potential but was poorly done, i would even say rushed into final production. kind of reminiscent of the prequel to the exorcist: the beginning. the theater release was good, i though so after watching it, but the movie release exorcist:dominion was a helluva lot better. same story just different director. same should be done here.

what a terrible misfire. not only the title but the idea is the same as that jane fonda, george segal vehicle of a few decades ago. why? i wonder, someone with the clout of jim carrey will, not only star, but also produce this tired, ugly, pointless excuse for a comedy. he could be taking comedy to a whole new level, instead, he goes for what he may assume is safe territory. money, money, grosses, christmas. but i'm sure this uncomfortable mess will have very short legs. i call it uncomfortable because that's how i felt. aware as i was of the desperate attempts tried out on the screen to be funny. and failing, miserably. it could have been an outrageous, politically incorrect, mirror comedy of the post enron days but no, that would be pointing too high, too risky. what a shame!

a satire about greed and money, what? there is more greed in the intentions behind this fiasco than in any of the themes they pathetically try to make fun of. jim carrey's reign was certainly short lived. he is an unbearable presence on the screen. the insincerity of his portrayal is nothing short of creepy. he produced this, this "masterpiece" as well, so he can't blame anyone here. "the number one comedy in america" shout the desperate tv adds. of course, jim carrey was suppose to guarantee full houses but the game is over. if i sound angry is because i am. i spent a sunny afternoon in california, plus, between tickets, parking, flat cokes etc, almost 45 bucks on this thing, starring and produced by mr carry. not anymore, do you hear? not anymore.

oh my lord, what were they thinking about with this one. it not only is frantically unfunny, but worse, a very good original was trashed in the bargain. jane fonda, believe it or not, actually turned in the performance of her life in that one. even better than where she plays the whore in the other so called performance of her life. maybe she is just flat good as a crook. any other time, wow, what a waste of time. but she and segal team up beautifully, so if you even remotely got a glimpse of anything funny in this baby, catch the anvil upon which it got beaten into a pulp from.because very very very little of that one remains, to this ones horror. nothing in this baby is remotely funny except for maybe a couple of moments when dick and jane are bulging lipped up as lepers and cant kiss..... and uhh........oh my lord, that's it? well, looks like it. it truly is that bad a film.

jim carrey is a particular brand of humour and i personally think he's a great actor (eternal sunshine, for example).however, this movie is presumably intended to be nothing more than a jim carrey vehicle, so be aware straight off that if you don't think his style of comedy is funny, you will sit stony-faced throughout this film, as it has nothing else to recommend it.even if you do like carrey's comedy, i am not sure you will find this film amusing. i went to see it on a saturday night at 10:30pm and the audience was definitely ready to laugh. they giggled throughout the trailers, which weren't particularly funny, but when it came to the film, stony silence. i think it raised about five genuine laughs.the problem with the movie is it doesn't know what it wants to be. it can't make up its mind whether it's going for slapstick or serious. if it were stupid throughout it could be forgiven but (i'm guessing) it's also trying to make a point about the relationship between the two central characters.the strong point of the film is the hold-ups, and there was plenty of potential here. but these didn't start until about halfway through and remained largely undeveloped. meanwhile, you have to sit through the first excruciating 40 minutes as the couple's life deteriorates.four separate groups walked out of this film while i was there, and if my flatmate hadn't asked me to keep away from the house (his girlfriend having just returned from a month-long vacation!), i would have done the same. and in my entire 25 years of movie going, i have done that just once before.

see dick work.see jane work.dick and jane are married.they are successful.they have a son. they have a nice house.they have a latino housekeeper.the housekeeper teaches spanish to the son.the son speaks spanish.ha-ha.see dick get promoted.the pompous ceo is a crook.see dick take the fall for the pompous ceo.jane quits her job.oops.see dick and jane out of work.dick & jane turn to crime.as a plot device, they decide to rob the ceo.see the robbery get botched.see dick & jane fund the company's pension plan with the money from the robbery.yay. see the end credits.okay, so you've got the plot. beyond that, dick and jane careens from one scene to the next. one barely connecting with the last one or the next one. the whole thing is terribly episodic in nature. jim carrey didn't bother to bring his "a" material, he just seems bored and slightly ashamed of the whole thing. but heck, when you're getting paid $20 million plus, why bother. tea leoni is frantic. i guess i would be frantic not to get blamed for this flop.there's just something sort of off about dick & jane. carrey and leoni aren't funny and have little chemistry. the script isn't funny. and it's not well-plotted.but it may be bigger than that. the reality of dick and jane is, perhaps, a little too real. maybe it's just not funny for people to lose their jobs in an enron-like situation, when real-life still lacks a happy ending.

dick and jane harper (jim carrey, téa leoni) wind up on the unemployment line when the corporation dick works for is caught in a corruption scandal, and after desperately and unsuccessfully trying to find jobs, the duo turns to crime in order to get them out of poverty.i've always been a fan of jim carrey. it's been awhile since he has made a straight up comedy. the last one was bruce almighty which was pretty good. he has proved that he can do serious dramas but comedy is his real element. fun with dick and jane proves that he still has it. even though the film was funny, it was still kind of disappointing. it wasn't as funny as i thought it would be. it's worth watching once though unlike most of carrey's movies, it doesn't have a good repeat value. part of the problem is the script. i was surprised the script was weak since this is the same guy that made the forty year old virgin. some of the jokes just fall flat and other times they seem to be trying too hard. if jim carrey wasn't in it, than the film would have been a lot worse.next to jim carrey is téa leoni. she's an okay actress but she just isn't very funny. she doesn't match up well with carrey and she seemed to be phoning in her performance. they should have gone with someone else. the supporting cast includes alec baldwin, richard jenkins and aaron michael jenkins. the latter plays billy harper and he actually gives a decent performance. he wasn't as annoying as most child stars are. alec baldwin was okay and richard jenkins tried too hard to be funny. to be honest, i'm a little bias here. the film altogether was pretty average but i liked it more because of jim carrey's performance. fans of jim carrey should enjoy it but that's about it. in the end, fun with dick and jane is a fun way to spend 90 minutes but its not very memorable. rating 6/10

there is no "fun" poking fun at the desperate plight of illegal immigrants! or the desperate plight of head-shop owners, for that matter! that the richer-than-god brian glazer didn't see the irony of having the "heroes" do exactly what the villain does - rob honest, hardworking people of their life savings - doesn't surprise me! hell, how do you think he got to be richer than god?!in this alleged satire about greed, these mental midgets reveal their own hypocrisy: the mcmansions, the mctoys, the mcchildren, the mcillegals who are paid peanuts to take care of the mcmansions, the mctoys, and the mcchildren! but the main problem (aside from the revolting bigotry) is the premise: as the former executive of a now-infamous company, dick would be the big scalp for every corporate headhunter in the country! no soup kitchens for him! and, raking in high six-figures, you'd think he wouldn't be caught dead around a gore/lieberman poster!

i rented this film out of the local video store one day, you know, the kind of movie with box art that just reaches out and tells you to 'rent me'. well, if you see this dull film in your video store, walk on by. fight the urge, rent a porno, because this film is booooooorrrring. despite the interesting opening, the film lapses into repetitive murders and a hardboiled cop stumbling around, dealing with the usual problems (wife, bastard of a boss, etc). wondering if the fast forward function on your vcr works? rent this film and put your concerns to the test.

a killer (john karlen) with a penchant for really bad disguises (afro wig on a white dude?) cruises around in his van looking for victims. detective decarlo (james luisi) is on the case and finds the killer rather easily by just hanging out by the local pool and looking for anyone looking weird (again, the afro wig comes into play). tracking the killer to his home, decarlo decides to set up a risky sting involving a female police psychologist.inspired by the crimes of ted bundy before he was caught, killer's delight is a pretty predictable and cheap serial killer flick. director jeremy hoenack has no idea how to pace a film or even make it suspenseful. he does know how to show lots of close ups of the killer wringing his hands though! the only thing this really has going for it is the captured 70s atmosphere (look out for the bathroom wallpaper). well, that and a downbeat ending. the media blasters/shriek show dvd has lots of nice stuff though including an audio commentary by hoenack and karlen, plus video interviews, trailers and an alternate opening.

detective sergent vince de carlo (james luisi) and company are on the case of a vicious serial killer/rapist. can psychologist carol (susan sullivan) help, or will she become the killer's next victim? and what is with the killer's hilarious white dude afro? inspired by the case of serial killer ted bundy, "killer's delight" aka "the dark ride" is a rather dull serial killer tale from 1978 that doesn't offer much. if anything, it's more of a police procedural flick than a horror movie, as much of the violence occurs off camera. sure, we get mutilated bodies, but we don't get a whole lot in the exploitation department-especially considering that they are from the aftermath, and not during the crime. those hoping for the likes of "the toolbox murders" or "maniac" will be very disappointed.fortunately, there is an impressive scene involving a woman trying to escape the killer that get's the tone right, and is quite suspenseful to boot. also, john karlen is quite effective as the killer, though his hilarious hairstyle (white guys with afros are always worth a chuckle) is more than a bit distracting."the dark ride" is too routine and mediocre to really warrant a recommendation, as it lacks the proper exploitation elements, and is dated even by the standards of the time. those looking for a better example should probably turn to "don't go in the house" and a few others instead, as this just doesn't cut it.

back in college i studied marketing and, even though i missed a whole lot of classes and never really paid any attention, i will always remember the main and most essential principle of marketing, namely: it's not what you sell; it's how you sell it! this principle fully applies to "the devil's triangle", as it's basically a beautifully wrapped and enticing yet empty package. writer/director richard winer knew exactly that he had to divert the viewer's attention away from the major inaccuracies, so he threw in some elements that never fail when it comes to providing a creepy atmosphere, like the sinister voice of narrator vincent price and the oddball music of king crimson. and i'm guessing richard winer's dirty little tricks worked very efficiently, as there was a huge bermuda triangle hype going on during the mid-70's and literally every movie production  whether it was an inaccurate documentary or a sleazy exploitation flick  covering the topic earned big money at the box office. "the devil's triangle" overwhelms you with data that is unstructured and often irrelevant, but the severe dramatization of the facts and of course the intimidating stark voice of the almighty vincent price generates an ambiance of fright and creepiness. the narration constantly jumps back and forward in time and covers a massive amount of "strange occurrences" and "mysterious vanishings" of ships and airplanes in the bermuda triangle throughout a period of nearly one whole century, but the reports remain extremely vague at all times and the eloquent mr. price invariably ends every chapter with the sinister words " just another unsolved mystery of the devil's triangle". after a couple of cases the whole formula simply becomes laughable and almost pathetic, but i guess it caused genuine mass hysteria back in 1974. the documentary expands a little more on the most notorious bermuda triangle mysteries, like the five planes of military flight 19 that inexplicably disappeared all at once and the peculiar case of the vessel uss cyclops, but still even in these chapters only a minimum of serviceable information is given. the cameras never at one point go underwater to explore the depths of the bermuda area, for example, and the testimonies of the supposedly real-life witnesses of the dramas suspiciously look like staged acting scenes. if you're looking for an informative and objective documentary on the bermuda triangle, i certainly wouldn't recommend this movie, but in case you want to sit back and listen to vincent price's hypnotizing voice for nearly a full hour, this is your chance!

this is by far the most repulsive and atrocious version of the scarlet pimpernel ever to be devised. as a pimpernel fan, i was sincerely offended by what they did to the characters--but this atrocity is not worth watching, even if you aren't familiar with the story.percy blakeney, for example, would never stab people in the back just to get down a hallway. chauvelin would never have a string of women in his bed. marguerite never had an affair with chauvelin, nor armand with minette, whoever the heck she is. chauvelin would not randomly shoot tony in the head. chauvelin's name is not, nor has it ever been, paul. they have completely eradicated any reference to the pimpernel's disguises, replacing them instead with james bond-esque gadgets and gizmos.as to the film itself... the makeup is horrifying. the women look like clowns. elizabeth mcgovern's beauty mark wanders around her face at random. the poor, pitiable actors have no script to work with, so it's not really their fault that their characters are as thin as wet tissue paper. the dialogue... oh, the dialogue. the dialogue is unbearable. and whoever is responsible for all those little captions at the bottom of the screen should be forced to watch this movie as penance. (i counted 13 location captions in the first half-hour before i gave up. as if we can't figure out that the body of water between england and france is the english channel.)the film--if i can bring myself to call it that, since it's really just videotape with a filter--is absolutely without redeeming value. do not waste your time and brain cells on this rancid drivel--instead, go watch the 1982 anthony andrews/jane seymour version, or the 1934 leslie howard film, or indeed anything but this one.

as someone who has read all of baroness orczy's books and seen most of the movies based on them, i must say that the 1980's version, with anthony andrews and jane seymour, was better than this. it was better written and stuck more to the spirit of the story than this one, which seemed to go out of its way to involve people getting shot. this new adaptation is less light-hearted, yet does not have as much depth, either. although there is some good acting, the actors did not have much to work with. nice costumes, though.

this is another of those films i can remember from when i was a kid and i recently managed to acquire it off ebay - 20 years on, it's nowhere near as good as i remember it being.the story is 'vaguely' kick started, by a 'cosmic event' (there's another extra film-crew member in the credits for 'weak story development') which makes collective ants become super intelligent. ant species who used to war with each other have ceased rivalries and are now working together. the thing i wanted to know throughout was, to do what exactly? you never find out what they want. nigel davenport and his sidekick travel out to the desert where bizarre ant activity has been noted, and begin to study the ants from an impregnable igloo shaped laboratory. probably the most chilling scene in my opinion was when the two scientists visit the giant square in the crops (like a square version of a crop circle) a result of the ants chomping away.this film was not very scary quite simply because you don't know whether to fear the ants or like them. all you know is that the ants want people to leave the area so they can get on with their hijinks - but you don't find out whether they are really baddies. it ain't a sci-fi because the 'cosmic event' explanation is too vague to be properly taken into account. it is deffo more of a chiller. tbh the flares, daft hairstyles, tight shirts with big collars and nigel davenports unnaturally big facial hair-do freaked me out more than the ants! did you notice that there are only six actors listed in the credits? yup, that right - six, and you won't see any other human beings in this film at all. not even in the distance! this is a plainly obviously low budget film which is a bit watchable because you probably won't have seen one like it. i can't think of any anyway. the filming of the ants is pretty good, they must have done months and months of filming before they had the shots they needed to stick in the film. you may well say to yourself 'how the hell do they get the ants to do that?' over and over, but it is all quite simple. you will also notice that the film makers sacrificed millions of innocent lickle ants to make the film too, so animal rights peeps stay away! good for novelty value, but you may not watch it more than once.

humour is a very individual thing and the audience at the sneak preview of the wog boy seemed to enjoy it more than i did. i found it an anachronistic affair, more representative of the old fashioned racial humour of the australian cinema of the 1960s and 1970s. the boy meets girl plot never takes off because of a lack of chemistry between lucy bell and nick giannopoulos while i found laughs thin on the ground. if you want to spend your money on this, wait until it's on video.

i'm glad i didn't pay to see 'the wog boy'.i sat there hopefully waiting for something original and/or funny to happen.it reminded me very much of those predictable english comedies of the 1970s.i won't bother with a synopsis of the plot, i suggest you do something else for 90 minutes

i really wanted to like this film however after an amusing opening few minutes i hardly cracked a smile. i agree there was no chemistry at all between the two leads and the other characters were cliche ridden. the script totally wasted the talents of bud tingwell and kim gyngell.it must be said however that there was plenty of laughter around me and even a smattering of applause at the end. perhaps i just couldn't relate to it enough. i'm just glad i went on cheap tickets.

this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times! lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing. i have to admit that the whole audience i was in was laughing hysterically but the majority were greek or italian so i guess that this humour will probably make them laugh but not me. all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes. god, and i can never get that 90 minutes back!

this is the first movie i have watched in ages where i actually ended up fast forwarding through the tedious bits which there are plenty of. very ordinary movie. i'm glad i missed it at the movies & got a 2 for 1 video deal which included this movie instead.

after seeing the tv commercials for this film i marched to my local cinema expecting a lot of laughs. in the end it was one of the longest 90mins i have ever spent. the wog boy really did fail to provide a story line with enough substance to hold my interest and predictable and sometimes tasteless jokes didn't fill this void.a scene where the two 'wog boys' dominate the dancefloor of their local nightclub was the only one that impressed me at all. the only character that was worth watching was 'nathan', played by the castle's stephen curry, his struggle with the opposite sex providing most of the few laughs.a word for this flic is boring. save yourself the time and just watch the tv commercial as the only laughs are shown on it.

... breaker morant and romper stomper . it has also given us watchable films such as bootmen and the odd angry shot . unfortunately for everyone involved in this debacle the wog boy won't be joining appearing in either list .i was looking forward to seeing this movie simply because of the politically incorrect title , so politically incorrect that when it was broadcast on bbc 2 late at night the announcer didn't even mention the movie's name so i was expecting something so offensively anachronistic that my jaw was going to drop in disbelief . it did drop in disbelief , i found myself not being able to believe that the financiers thought this was going to be a major international hit the problem lies with the cast and the script . i do know that australia with its small population doesn't have a large pool of actors so i'll be forgiving for the most part , but this doesn't stop my criticism of nick giannopoulos as steve . for this type of comedy to work you must be impressed with the comic skills of the lead actor and i'm sorry to say but nick g just doesn't have the skills . i'd never heard of him and seen nothing else he's been in so perhaps he's much better at other performances . here however he's just plain irritating , unconvincing and i lost count at the number of times he mugged for the camera . the jokes themselves are very flat and predictable and getting back to the script it seems very under developed , i mean who thought a running gag about a female minster of work who's having it off in the back of a limousine was funny to begin with ? you do get the feeling that someone in the production should have been more honest and said " look mate , this screenplay's not nearly good enough . go and make it more subtle and structured "i've been harsh and harshness has been called for in this review . i gave the movie four out of ten and it would have only got three if it wasn't for the one genuinely funny sequence where steve is watching a current affairs show only for himself flashing up on screen and labelled a " dole blodger " . this shows that the screenwriters were aware of comic timing and social comment . such a pity that they didn't come with a much better written movie

i'm starting to wonder, after reading some of the opinions here, if i watched the same film as the other reviewers but after checking my facts i am forced to the sad conclusion that i have.this witless wannabee screwball comedy has to be one of the the longest 94 minutes i have spent, and one of the most unfunny things i have seen, for ages. now don't get me wrong, i love screwball comedies, but this boring, set-bound drivel falls so far short of the dizzy heights of preston sturges and howards hawks that it doesn't deserve (to mix my metaphors) to be thought of in the same breath as those greats. writer / director charles martin's dialogue is neither witty, subtle or interesting - and there's so much of it. he doesn't know how to end a scene either, with some ruthless cutting, especially of people exiting rooms and saying goodbye to each other, the pace of film would have been lifted and then the fact that the limited number of characters are doing stupid and motiveless things for no other reason than this is supposed to be a comedy would have been a little less obvious. characters in this movie fall in and out of love with each other, and move in and out of apartments, at a moment's notice only to move what little plot there is forward. one moment people are desperately yearning for one person, the next they are getting married to someone else - having wooed and been wooed off screen so we know nothing about it until one of the characters tells us - "oh, they're getting married!" (usually after someone has made a faux-pas or jumped to the wrong conclusion). if we had known that these two characters were in love or supposed to be engaged before hand we, the audience, might have enjoyed the experience of watching someone making a fool of themselves in front of them. as it is the characters just come over looking like selfish, petulant idiots and we have no sympathy for any of them.the sets are limited and the action confined to them in a way that makes the whole thing look like a badly filmed stage play. the only moments of relief from the tedium are keenan wynn who looks like he has wandered in from a different movie and has decided to hang around and be slightly funnier than all the unfunny stuff going on around him.highly avoidable.

since i'd bought the dvd, i watched as much of this as i did out of a sense of obligation to my wallet.the plot has kirk douglas as a successful first novelist who hired laraine day as a secretary, falls in love, and marries her. complications ensue.douglas is usually thought of as an intense actor, given to heavily dramatic roles, sometimes hero, sometimes rat. he's not bad in this thoroughly comic part. the problem is that the part isn't particularly comic and neither is anything else.the plot rambles on. a dozen "quirky" characters come and go -- most prominently keenan wynn as douglas's friend who does nothing but make wry comments. thelma ritter was better at this sort of thing.well, if the plot is weak it could still have been rescued by some sparkle in the dialog but there is none to speak of. some gags are silly. others don't clear that bar. here's what i thought of as an amusing line. douglas has just hired day and wants to get her down to the beach house and seduce her. day is disturbed and remarks that she's never heard of a writer working in a beach house. wynn asks if she liked douglas's previous book, "last year's love." yes, of course she did. "well, most of 'last year's love' was done in the beach house." ha ha.nice cast, including support, but a failed comedy. there have been better sitcoms on television.

ineffectual, molly-coddled, self-pitying, lousy provider jimmy stewart is having a bad marriage to carole lombard. after falling on hard times, he endures a demeaning job, a fault-finding, passive-aggressive, over-bearing live-in mother who is in dire need of an epic smackdown, and an endlessly-crying baby. the movie trowels on failure and squalor to no discernible end. do you want to watch a couple bicker with his mom for ninety minutes? many scenes feature a shrieking baby. the movie fails to elucidate why we would want to endure the mother from hell, or why jimmy stewart can't grow a pair. who wanted to see this? who wanted to see stewart and lombard without laughs or charm?it's absolutely depressing and unendurable.

i decided to watch this movie because i'd not seen carol lombard before in any movie. i'm sorry it had to be this one because, quite frankly, this is a dog  and even with jimmy stewart and charles coburn, both of whom were great actors.the problem with the film is simple: it tries to put too much, too quickly, in to a story about a young lawyer (john manson played by stewart) who marries jane (played by lombard) within an hour of meeting her. what's that cliché? marry in haste, repent at leisure... in short, the story is a series of episodes that show the couples' worsening financial status, their troubles with john's live-in mother, their struggles to pay the bills, john's diminished status at the office, the arrival of their baby son, john jnr (unexpected and causing additional friction at home with mother), the couples' angst about their marriage, the baby's sickness which worsens, thus necessitating an heroic flight by a lone pilot (in a fierce storm) to bring a special serum to save the child, and finally john being accepted as a junior partner at the law firm.how many more clichéd situations could the writers include? maybe mother dying soon after? there wasn't much comedy; the drama was lacklustre, at best; the dialog was painful to hear. only the acting of the four main players was adequate.this was the period at the end of the great depression with the usa coming out of its long downturn  during which many people experienced all of the events portrayed in the movie.so, it made sense for selznick to reaffirm good ol' home spun american values of family, relationships, heroism, perseverance, and initiative  all against the backdrop of the "average" american family. who better to use than jimmy stewart and carol lombard? and, it should be noted that the film was released in early 1939; so, it was planned in 1938  soon after the usa began to get production going for the coming world war ii. hence, this sort of film was a great booster for the general public, at that time, many of who would soon have to join england in war. as many here would know, hollywood and washington formed an uneasy alliance before, during and after the war.however, i'm glad i saw it  as a piece of disguised socio-political propaganda. but, i'll have to see other lombard films to gain a better appreciation of her acting range.as another reviewer noted: see this one just to say that you've seen all of stewart's movies; otherwise, don't bother.

extremely formulaic with cosmic-sized logic holes and a pretense at comedy. aw, poor nyc lawyer! he's just scraping by, and when he gets a reduction in pay he doesn't go out to find another job, though he's one of the most respected lawyers in the area. we see him arguing in court so that others come up and congratulate him on his fiery, winning delivery, but he can't stand up to anyone in his firm. at home, problems are ignored until people storm out of the house.the only character you want to root for is the final maid, who seems an actual human being who uses logic and communication to survive in the world. how laughable that the maid should bring the lawyer and his wife a chicken and wine on new year's eve because she feels sorry for them! (the bit's not played for laughs.)sorry, just too unbelievable and with a **spoiler** pat, everyone-turns-180-degrees ending. how'd they get top-notch stars for this? if i'd been at the studio i'd have sent this one back for a complete rewrite.

carole lombard and james stewart gamely try to inject some life and meaning into this bizarrely constructed film about the tribulations of a newlywed couple. the scenes play as if they were parceled out among various directors, each with a different goal. some are capra-cute, some screwball, some melodramatic, and some surprisingly noir. there's even an extended adventure sequence, when the plot suddenly focuses on a small plane flying through a blizzard. it's hard to say which scenes are the most incongruous, when the film as a whole is so erratic in tone, and the storyline not exactly believable. only worth watching for film students or fans of the actors--some smaller parts, such as judge doolittle and the intrepid pilot, are also very well played.

when i bought 4 dvds for £5.oo in a local shop it should have been warning enough that this movie was not up to the usual standard of david selznick productions. with a cast containing such names as james stewart and carole lombard i was looking forward to a real treat. as many other commentators have said it is an odd mixture of plot and scenes that doesn't quite convince. however, i am so glad that i did view this film as i now have the memorable saying 'never let the seeds stop you from enjoying the watermelon.' to live by. this should sum up everyone's life. pick out those seeds or spit them out or swallow them - and then enjoy the watermelon - life itself.

this film doesn't have a very clear picture of what it is or wants to be. there are some good bits when stewart is on screen and they give him some lines to work with. it works best early on as romantic comedy, but the story keeps heading for more dramatic territory and gets itself lost in the process. by the last fifteen minutes or so, the plot twists are just a series dramatic clichés. the part with the airplane feels like some leftover footage from another film spliced in.the main reason i can think of to watch it is if you want be able to say you've seen all of jimmy stewart's films.

james stewart plays johnny mason, lawyer. carole lombard is jane mason, wife. lucile watson the mother-in-law harriet mason. johnny sees jane and quickly marries her. mother is disappointed. mother lives with them. many troubles are ahead. jane can't cook. can't set the table. can't do many things according to mother. the interaction between daughter-in-law and mother are the highlights of this film. stewart and lombard are married but just don't have any real magic on screen. stewart is stewart. he is good as a timid husband and son but this doesn't carry the film. can baby mason build bridges between jane and harriet? a believable film for those that are married.

this movie is an example of small budget,ineffective star cast,weak storyline and poor entertainment. this kind of movies are made for commercial breaks and not for any entertainment of die-hard fans of bollywood movies. i went to this movie because i thought the earlier one gangster was tolerable so this is also. only thing i appreciate the way new actress put herself in the movie in a very bold way, she very much resembles bollywood actress nandita das. she is good ,sexy and acting well. she definitely go up in her career. our mithunda was all time good at his work .atleast he has some good to the movie. i didn't like imraan for his role must advise him to improve himself now as he has done many movies as new actor and he has been seen as established actor this movie has nothing except the bold scene done by new actress never try this movie

taran adarsh a reputed critic praised such a dubba moviethe film has a weird story wherein a lover sells his love to a brothel cos he wants money to save his mother and then also gets forgived for it lolthe movie is crapthe entire first half has it's focus on romance, comedy which fails to work the twist shocks but the entire second half is a mess and the climax is clichéddirection by aditya datt is bad music is typical himeshemraan does his serious role well but his wardrobe, his way of walking through songs.etc is similar to his previous films geeta bhasra annoys ashmith patel fails to convince this actor was good in murder only so far and then a downhill mithun some screen time and he is okay but his breaking down into a song is forced ranjeet is okay

avoid this film if you are looking for entertainment.it is filled with wannabes trying to be something that they are not and emraan is just wasted in the role of a tour guide who falls for a newcomer who needs to go to acting school. seriously, where to they get these people from? just because you're pretty doesn't mean you can act or should be an actress.asmit patel needs to send an apology letter to everyone who accidentally watches him makes a fool of himself in this poor excuse for a film. he plays an insipid wannabe gangster who drugs girls and forces them to fall in love with him and sells them off to the highest bidder.

fortunately, i haven't seen this film in a movie, big screen, just on a small screen on video. i doubt that i would have been able to sit through the film in a cinema and watch all the violence present in the film. after watching the first 30 minutes, i became both disappointed and curious.disappointed because of the hard to follow story line, the hardly understandable screens, the huge amount of aggression - i still don't know why i had been shown the daesu (main character) pulling out raw the teeth of another person, his beastliness on women, him cutting out his tongue. and also curious, to see what will the film say as a conclusion, what is the ending summary of all this brutality.unfortunately, though the movie was not boring, i didn't get any answer to all these cruelty that i had to watch from the beginning to the end. to my opinion, if you want blood and want to laugh, there is kill bill 1-2, if you want blood with more meaning, you can take any recent war movie, and if you want an eastern movie, there are much better titles out there. afterwards i will take the ratings from the cannes film festival with more precaution, as while oldboy got a lot of praise from the jury, it had not much to say to me and had only 4/10 on my scale.i am hungry to see something beautiful, harmonious, with true feelings and a clear message.

this digital horror film brings us into the micro-budget film genre where the more blood and chicks in distress the better. the story is weak, the acting is respectable and the special effects, well, they're special alright. a quality horror film for the fans that already know what to expect.

jeff leroy wanted to makes fun of scientology so built a horror movie around a cult similar to it. the twist is that instead of frail old l. ron hubbard as the cult leader, there's a centuries old space monster who turns his followers into vampires. our hero is a dirty living college student who is doing research into the occult. his landlord is an attractive blonde who tries to get him to clean up his life with the help of the cult. it doesn't take him long to figure out that she's only after one thing: his blood. "the screaming" was shot very cheaply on video and i just plain ugly. the space monster (which looks like a giant winged cat that looks perpetually mad and has no skin) is alternately a clay-mation miniature and a large scale animatronics puppet, both of which look awful. the acting and writing are both terrible and the director doesn't even try to disguise the fact that this movie was made for nothing. avoid this non-scary, pitiful little excuse.

the screaming is a very low budget horror movie that was shot on video. it features passable acting, poor lighting, a weak story, and some of the worst monster effects i've ever seen. the plot has a college student being pressured to join a cult by his attractive landlord. the cult is a parody of scientology with a book similar to dianetics. this would have been a funny shot at that group were it not for a dumb script and the cheapness of the production. the monster effects look awful and the picture quality makes it feel like you're watching a home video or a public-service announcement. i think anyone who sees this will agree that movies should be shot on film.

bottom-of-the-barrel stinker is so bad it's beyond funny. the "plot" is about an american mercenary, played by reb brown (in the film he's called a "military adviser" but it's not really clear if he's in the american military or not), helping the army of a latin-american country fight guerrillas who winds up joining the guerrillas when the government turns on him, imprisons and tortures him. shannon tweed is a "sports equipment saleswoman" he picks up in a bar who gets caught up in all the intrigue. that description actually makes the movie sound better than it is, because it's really a stinker of almost biblical proportions. how bad is it? well, shannon tweed turns in the movie's most professional acting job. if that isn't an indication of just what a 12th-rate piece of junk this turkey is, nothing is from mismatched sound effects to a music score that sounds like it's from a 1940s "z"-grade horror flick (and may very well be) to the same footage (i.e., armored personnel carriers going down the same jungle trail) reused constantly to some of the most ineptly staged "action" scenes in recent memory, this laugh-a-minute sludgefest has to be seen to be disbelieved. tweed looks bored, brown looks hung over, and by the time this thing is finished--if you can last that long; i couldn't--you'll know just how they feel.although there are a lot of explosions and gunfights, this can't be considered an "action" picture by any stretch of the imagination. it's boring (there's a scene in the back of a truck where everybody just stares at each other for three or four minutes), repetitive (the same "rebels" and "soldiers" being killed over and over), illogical (when a group of rebels is caught in an open field by a government helicopter gunship, instead of breaking for cover they just stand there staring up at it), inept (soldiers and rebels falling "dead" when no gunshots are heard, a gun battle inside a house where combatants standing against walls are machine-gunned but miraculously the walls escape undamaged) predictable (when the "governor" says to offer a reward for brown's capture because "someone" might turn him in, you know exactly who that "someone" will be, and it turns out to be exactly who you thought it was) and just downright stupid (pretty much everything else in the picture). inept, brainless and stupid beyond belief. don't waste your time.

found this film for one dollar ($1.00) and the film was a complete waste of time. reb brown,(mark hardin), played a military adviser in south america and was successful in capturing the leader of rebel soldiers operating out of the dense jungles. however, mark joins the opposite side after some horrible tortures were inflicted or women and men. in one scene as mark is having a drink in a hotel bar, his eyes catch the glimpse of sexy long legs sandra spencer (shannon tweed),"dead sexy",01. mark and sandra have the extreme hots for each other and even make passionate love on some very hard rocks, with no time for the comforts of a bed. this is a horrible film and not worth wasting the time to even look at it.

look, this film is terrible... the "plot" involves twins who are neglected by their self-absorbed parents, and left in the care of a succession of nannies and babysitters, all of whom the children drive away by being completely obnoxious. eventually the kids engineer ex-convict beverly d'angelo to be their new nanny, do you care why? and d'angelo watches a tv talk show about selling children and decides she will try to sell the twins... and, well, oh, you don't want to know. it's all very unpleasant, and not at all funny. in fact the announcer slated this film before it came on the tv channel i was watching! just don't bother wasting a single moment of your life on this pile of complete trash, y'hear?

this could have been a really good movie if someone would just have known how to finish the film.the story was going along just fine and heading towards that point in every movie like this where the "gray" characters turn "good" and the "bad" guys get their just desserts and *boom* ... it's like they ran out of script and the cast just started to make things up.which wouldn't have been so bad ... if the cast had just continued with the character development they had already put in place. but such is not the case and the movie soon becomes a goofy mess.my advice is to watch this movie up to about the last 30 minutes ... and then shut it off. at this point, imagine how you think the next 30 minutes will look based on what you have seen so far.believe me, the ending you come up with will look far better than how this film actually ends. trust me on this.

what crack are you smoking? this movie, while gloriously entertaining, is awful! the action scenes are so obviously fake it's kind of sad. the colonel's daughter is painfully irritating. the ninja training camp is so hilarious it is almost not worth mentioning. and when joe puts the bucket over his head and beat up the other army guy, i just about peed myself. i could go on...entertaining, arguably so. good, no. well made, certainly not.as a commentary on america as empire, it's actually pretty good. joe as a typical white conqueror isn't all that surprising, especially in the context of mid-1980s american cinema.

for many year i saw this movie as a real movie of ninjas but after study more about this culture i can only think this is just another karate film. a black shinobi and some weapons doesn't make a ninja, it's much more than that. the ninja are the most dangerous warrior of the japan because they are trained in every aspect of life to survive to anything, killing whatever try to stop them. this movie is not a about a ninja warrior just about a clown trying to be something he cannot even understand.

ask a thousand people what the greatest unintentional comedy of all time is, and they will almost invariably tell you battlefield earth or plan 9 from outer space. they're wrong. american ninja has those two turkeys beat down for a number of reasons, not the least of which being a script that was quite clearly not thought through. while i fully support the b picture industry for keeping slobs like michael dudikoff in work, a little work on the product would have gone a long way.for those who give a rat's posterior, my next few paragraphs will give away significant parts of the plot.first of all, when we are given some background information on the titular hero, we are told his date of birth, next of kin, parents, and so forth, are all unknown. i don't know about you, but i expect the us army to take fact-finding about its personnel a little more seriously. they also manage to screw up the continuity of dates quite effectively, although i don't remember quite which dates were screwed up and when. this is actually one of american ninja's less obvious flaws.it has been pointed out before, but a common failing of many martial arts films is that when our heroes are confronted by large numbers of antagonists, said antagonists attack one at a time. more recent films such as the matrix reloaded defy this convention, but just about every film from the 1980s has the audience screaming, "hey, why don't you attack all at once???". martial arts films tend to be a lot more impressive when the fights are more extensive than one-on-one.the central premise was originally a joke, but in light of recent events where the us army cannot crush a mob of insurgents simply because they won't delegate to the specialists, it seems strangely ironic. phillipino renegades are stealing weapons from the us army's local division for sale to wealthy clients. never mind that such a theft would prompt the army to give the local businessmen responsible, or even believed responsible, an aerial rectal exam, this is a cheesy 1980s action film, after all.by far the funniest part of the film is the climactic battle, however. as joe and jackson turn combining posing and fighting into an art form, evil ninjas start to explode for no readily apparent reason. i agree with one previous commentator in that this film should have been called ninja holocaust, because i'm willing to bet a total of at least three hundred evil ninjas bite it during the film's running time. on top of that, the black star ninja starts fighting with rocket launchers, laser beams, and all sorts of ridiculous implements that are not only poorly thought out, they're flat-out poorly executed. you'll never see a laser beam effect that looks cheaper.what tops it all off is that the film takes itself so damned seriously. during the scene when joe is meeting up again with his old mentor, i dare the viewer not to laugh at the hideous dialogue. not that i know any modern practioners of ninjitsu, but the logical part of my imagination has a hard time believing that they have spoken like this at any time in their history. during this mentoring scene, i half expect the old guy to tell joe he must prove his manhood by cutting his own head off with a blunt plastic spoon.in all, i gave american ninja a 1. this is a special score in my system in that it is reserved for the worst, most appalling, most offensive films i've ever seen, or films that make me laugh without even bothering to try. american ninja is definitely an example of the latter.

this is a great movie for first time ninjas who are dating. if you're trying to impress some cute little ninjette i would highly recommend playing this masterpiece. its one of those special movies that allows you to miss large sections of it without interfering with the plot.also i was wondering, where does a teal ninja hide? are ninjas color coded like this? is this normal? if i were attacked by one of these yellow or orange ninjas i would die of laughter before succumbing to his sword.and i finished my black star ninja test the other day, it was multiple choice, it went pretty good. i found there were a lot of questions on how to "sneak" around and look evil. its all about the eyebrows and the attitude. basically, the movie could have been better if: 1. there was no color coded ninjas (or the color coded ninjas could combine into a super ninja). 2. joe died in the first two minutes and patricia had to avenge him 3. miscellaneous monkeys were scattered throughout the file 4. patricia didn't talk and patricia was replaced with another character 6. the french guy was also a black star ninja 7. chris tucker, whoopi golderg, and chris rock were added as "comic" relief 8. ninja strengths came from miticlorians.

the plot is very basic, but acceptable: a young us soldier, having studied asian martial arts, puts this to good use in defence of the general's daughter and falls in love with her. unfortunately, the three main acting parties' (soldier, girl, rebels) combined iq amounts to 3: one point for the soldier, one for the girl, a large number of ninja fighters have to share the third point among them to be able to lose against the former two.

if you're in the mood for a really bad porno with no good porn combined with a really bad horror movie, this movie is perfect for you. however, if you breathe air, make sure you spend your time watching anything but this. the acting is crappy. the "plot" is crappy. they try too hard, and the whole time i was waiting for the one good redeeming scene that might make the movie worth watching. nope. stick with the scrambled cable.

"yagyu ichizoku no inbo" (let's just say "the shogun's samurai") is somewhere between horrifically boring and mind-bogglingly painful to watch. as an historical epic, it could have had so many more chances to be a rich saga... but it's really no more than just another cheap '70s action flick with a based-on-real-events story and an eyepatch-sporting sonny chiba. before this movie's halfway point, i was even tempted to commit seppuku! the music is like a thousand dogs in heat wailing in your ears to a tune composed by ennio morricone (that's not an insult towards morricone). the use of zoom lens cinematography is more nauseating than fascinating. and in terms of action, it's really nothing more than a series of brutal attacks and oh-no-they-didn't shocks. what a terrible movie.

i have seen nearly all the films of kurosawa and dozens of other japanese films as well. compared to these other films, this is a rather average to poor film. the plot features two warring brothers--neither one of which i cared much for--and it is very confusing keeping up with who is allied with who. the music and cinematography is pretty good, but the special effects, at times, are terrible--rubber heads flying off with about the same realism as the average high school play! on top of these complaints, the ending of the movie completely destroys and undermines the entire picture. it turns out that the end isn't true but was completely "fudged". what's the point of this, then? if you have seen this film, understand that there are many better films out there, so don't give up!

director kinji fukasaku is perhaps best known, in his homeland at least, for his japanese gangster films, a series with which this movie shares a number of characteristics. violence and political intrigue are themes throughout both shogun's samurai and battles without honor and humanity, and both feature a lead character who finds his loyalties challenged by betrayals. both films also feature a large number of characters who seem to have little purpose but to die, and since so little is done to develop them, their deaths have little impact when they do come. this film has other flaws as well. the makeup, costumes and sound design are distractingly poor, and the battle scenes were substandard as well, inferior to other samurai films of earlier years (seven samurai comes to mind). sonny chiba plays the sonny chiba character in shogun's samurai, the no-nonsense master swordsman who strides through the film, scowling menacingly. what a guy; he even gets to wear an eye patch. if you were expecting to see the legendary toshiro mifune, you may be disappointed; his appearance amounts to little more than a cameo, and just when it appears that his character might do something interesting, he disappears for good. overall, the strengths of the film are its story, which is infinitely more comprehensible than those gangster films, and the challenges posed to traditional concepts of good and evil. two brothers are challenging for the throne of their recently departed father, who may have had some help on his way out. early on, it looks as if we will be faced with a couple of characters who couldn't be more clearly good and evil; after all, the older brother stammers and has a birthmark, the sure sign of a villain. eventually, however, it becomes clear that in a winner-takes-all struggle for power, there are no heroes and villains, only winners and losers.

in this film, there is a loose plot of a man (bardem) who wishes to obtain financing for his construction business, and marries a woman he does not love (the wide-eyed maria de medieros) in the process. he maintains his passionate relationship with his first and true love, and ultimately gets entangled in his own romantic web. he never gives up his juggling act, until the three main characters come face to face. the film results boring, with lots of free sex (well, both girls are really good), all the reactions in the film are absurd, incoherent and of course, too much stupid. none of the characters are believable, which makes the movie a little annoying. anyway, the acting is surprisingly good for such a bad directed film, which makes it a little interesting, but, if you can, watch another film please!

a bit too much mediterrenean machismo for me. the cast was beautiful, lovely to watch in all of the romantic scenes. the locale was beautiful with azure skies and azure water. it just was not convincing to me that such an egomaniac crud bent on nothing but his building, could attract so many beautiful, vulnerable, women. only in the mediterranean i guess. certainly in no world i am familiar with. the macho men were really obnoxious, and i found it difficult to believe that the female characters could have anything to to with them for so long. the screenplay, cinematography, directing, etc. was set up to deliver a class b film, the central effort being on showing scenes of beautiful exposed female breasts. it was aesthetically nice for a while but it could not sustain a very mediocre film.

thank god i have fast-forward. i think this is a movie about a guy who rises and falls. whatever: it's a stupid cliché. it doesn't make any difference. there's this guy, javier bardem, who constructs buildings or something. it doesn't matter. he is handsome, this javier bardem. who cares? i think there is a car wreck but i watched this in fast-forward, so ...who cares? car wrecks and handsome heroes who struggle back from them smells like a melodrama to me. javier likes someone , but he marries maria de madeiros instead.she is magnificently, poetically beautiful, with a heart-shaped face. then javier has an oral-interface with maribel verdu, who washes her vulva, beforehand, for some reason. you would think maribel verdu, with her hand-washed vulva would be sexy. no, she is not. this is a tedious story about a bunch of people who don't interest me. javier, maribel, and maria have a threesome: how boring. this film is annoying. i think this might be a minor theme of (some) spanish-language movies: the rise and predictable fall of a little guy who succeeds against the odds. let me just clear this up: this is a high-class melodrama or perhaps soap opera. it is not worth your time, except for a laugh.

with some films it is really hard to tell for whom they were made. huevos de oro seems to aim at the well educated spanish middle class. there must be many inside jokes in this movie which you will not understand if you are an outsider. this can be pretty annoying.symbols and references to art and popular culture abound, the movie alludes to the work of salvador dalí, luis buñuel and the surrealists in general, a certain infatuation with bidet baths seems to point to duchamp's ready mades. what's more, the main character has also a knack for karaoke tapes with songs of julio iglesias. but why all this is mixed together in a rather pretty but also gratuitous way simply eludes me. i can only guess that it all serves to highlight the vital, impetuous, boorish vulgarity of the main character who the director seems to admire and despise at the same time. how all the really pretty women run after him (the main character, i mean) is slightly disconcerting.the movie has three parts. it starts in the spanish enclave of melilla in africa, where benito, the main character, does his military service, apparently in the corps of engineers. then it moves on to the resort town of benidorm in spanin where benito just wants to build the highest skyscraper of the place and become a vulgarized howard roark. for the last part a defeated benito moves to miami, florida, presumably in order to start a new life". but the change of places is not really explained satisfactorily. it is also somehow irritating that there is no character development and that the movie descends into a soap opera modus without being convincingly ironic. it must be said that javier bardem acquits himself very well playing the young stud who grows limp and deflated.i purchased this movie because i am interested in townscapes. and benidorm is a kind of a special place, townscapewise. in this aspect huevos de oro satisfied me only partially. in jess franco's she killed in ecstasy (1970) this specific location was used in a more rewarding way.

when watching this movie, with it's deterministic cause and effect, wall-to-wall clichés and hackneyed sentiment, can anyone be so naive as to think that this is actually how barrie's life played out? you watch it in a posture of disagreement. hollywood biopics aren't based on the individual lives anymore, they're just rewrites of previously successful biopics. if hollywood made a movie about your life it would be filled with such perfect synchronization that you'd barely recognize your own story. any personal complexity would be obliterated by some all-explaining, simplistic backstory. your story would resemble "rocky" because it's the only life-arc hollywood knows how to produce anymore. we couldn't leave the audience pondering anything left open-ended as they exit. this movie doesn't trust an audience to figure things out without being led to them. i perceived the captain hook/mother reference eons before the movie literalized it for me. i could see the 25 kids twist coming for days.this is a completely average movie. not horrible but not great. hence it's likely to be showered with a few oscars next year. there's nothing the academy likes better than congratulating itself for finally noticing patterns put in place over the previous thirty years.from the new yorker article "lost boys" by anthony lane: "arthur llewelyn davies, also adored his boys, and it may be unfair of "finding neverland" to omit him, for streamlining purposes, from the scene; by the time that johnny depp meets kate winslet, she is already a widow, whereas arthur was very much alive when barrie first entered the consciousnessand, little by little, the homeof the llewellyn davies family."finding neverland" is a weepie. from the moment that barrie met george and jack, and started to ponder the means by which they might be rendered immortal, the story is sad, but the reality is even more dismal: 1907arthur llewellyn davies dies from cancer of the jaw. 1910sylvia dies of lung cancer. the five boys are orphaned; barrie is made their guardian. 1915george is killed in the first world war, fighting with his regiment in flanders. 1921michael, an undergraduate at oxford, is drowned while swimming with a friend. the two bodies, when recovered, are found clinging together.on april 5, 1960, peter llewellyn davies, by then an esteemed publisher, threw himself under a subway train in london. we should not presume to read a mind in torment, but we may note in passing that, if he had lived another month, he would have reached the centenary of barrie's birth and thus, one imagines, a fresh flurry of interest in "peter pan""that terrible masterpiece," in the words of peter llewellyn davies.

a previous imdb reviewer has stated that 'rafter romance' is a 'rip-off' (that's the other reviewer's term) of a german musical called 'me by day, you by night'. apparently that reviewer is unaware that *both* of these films have borrowed their premise from 'box and cox', an english play written by john maddison morton in 1847. this play deals with two tradesmen who rent the same room from an unscrupulous landlady, each man believing himself the sole tenant. because the two men have different work schedules, the ruse is not discovered straight away. this play was once so popular in britain that 'to box and cox it' became a common term for an arrangement in which two people willingly shared accommodations meant for only one person.the innovation of 'rafter romance' (and its predecessor) is that the two tenants are now a man and a woman, who inevitably develop a romance. as is usual in these cornball movies, the guy and the gal detest each other until they fall into each other's arms. hoo boy.the landlord in this film is played by george sidney, a character actor who specialised in playing jewish stereotypes that were meant to be sympathetic. george sidney was never as annoying as the odious harry green (the jewish equivalent of stepin fetchit) but sidney's depictions of jewish characters are still exaggerated and embarrassing to watch.the single most notable thing about 'rafter romance' is that, to my knowledge, this is the earliest hollywood film to make reference to hitler and the rise of nazism. at one point in this movie, landlord eckbaum (sidney) discovers his teenage son julius engaged in chalking swastikas on the walls. eckbaum and his son are clearly meant to be jewish. admittedly, nobody in hollywood in 1933 had any real idea of what hitler was planning for the jews in europe ... still, it's surprising to see a film depicting a jewish teenager who thinks that swastikas are a joke. his father is, quite properly, angered by this display of the nazi symbol.a very shameful aspect of hollywood history is the documented fact that all of the major hollywood studios continued to do business with the third reich as late as 1939. hollywood's leading ladies were medically documented as 'aryan' so that their films could be distributed in nazi germany and austria. for the same reason, hollywood's leading men were documented as 'aryan and uncircumcised'. except for darryl zanuck at twentieth century-fox, all the hollywood studio executives who colluded in this policy were jewish ... but clearly had no objection to doing business with hitler. i'm surprised that 'rafter romance' contains a scene depicting swastikas unfavourably, as this sequence would have rendered the film verboten in germany and austria. (maybe the scene was cut out for german release: it isn't crucial to the movie's plot.) apart from this, the movie contains nothing notable. robert benchley does his usual unfunny befuddled characterisation: i've never understood the appeal of this man. i'll rate 'rafter romance' 4 out of 10.

for this movie, based off of a tv show, and a serious finale. i thought that it was a lousy way to end off a serious. 'm*a*s*h goodbye, farewell, and amen' was pretty good, but not this one. unless you really love the series (like myself) skip this movie.i was a loyal fan of the show even stevens, but the plot was too gimmicky, and dave coulier, man, that guy hasn't done anything good...well, ever. they shouldn't have used tim meadows, he's a great actor, but he was too good for the script.i thought the movie was pure cheese. i would give it a 4.5/10

for a film made in senegal, based, i guess loosely on carmen, the book, by prosper merimee, this film doesn't achieve a mere resemblance of the story that has been made famous as an opera and as other films.ms. gai as the karmen of the title is very good to look at. her fiery dancing smolders the screen, as is the case with her torrid love scene at the beginning of the film.this is a karmen that aims to please to all genders, but a real carmen, she is not!we would like to see ms. gai in other films in which her talent is better used than here.

i gave this 2 stars out of a possible 10.i went into this not realizing what it was - and discovered it is apparently some kind of african musical - since people break into song every few minutes.none of the songs rhyme, most of them aren't really saying anything sensible, and they all have the same non-existent tune - if you could call it a "tune."karmen is a tall, spectacularly built young woman, with the longest braids i've ever seen. [the actress looks as if she has probably done some modeling.]the film opens in a women's prison, although not like any prison i've ever seen or heard of -- the inmates wear whatever they wish - and seem to be having a party.karmen does some frantic dancing, and the woman warden of the prison, angelique,[a magnificently handsome woman]is definitely erotically interested. she and karmen dance together. later karmen visits the warden's room and they make love - unfortunately the scene is not detailed, and is very short, although there is some nudity.karmen then escapes from the prison and next we see her dancing in front of another group where a man, named lamine, maybe a colonel - it was never really clear who he was, watches her. he is with a young woman who dislikes karmen's seductive dancing and there is a dance-off between the two women.after that the story [such as it is] becomes even more muddled.with lamine in jail, out of jail, and who knows where.karmen may be involved with a group of smugglers or thieves.there is more singing. more dancing, and a scene of angelique obviously suffering from heartbreak.the film muddles its way to a finish, and i heaved a sigh of relief that it had ended. 

this very loose retelling of carmen begins on a high note with a smoldering, sexually-frank dance between senaglese prisoner "karmen" and her female prison warden, but the vibrant opening minutes never ignite into any coherent film. one minute karmen is all sexual predator, the next she is dancing in protest to her unfair government, and then suddenly she is a smuggler on the high seas... although the film deserves kudos for postulating the first carnivorously bisexual "karmen," the broad strokes it paints are so vignette-like and unsupported by any narrative coherence that the film comes off as a schizophrenic, undisciplined melange of "basic-instinct" meets "bound" meets an african version of a bollywood musical.

i walk out of very few movie screenings and this movie managed to become one of those that i couldn't bear to watch any longer. as far as the awards it won goes, the ones awarded by turkish festivals are not credible in my opinion. my only explanation for the queens festival award was to think that somehow a layer of comedy was "gained in translation" as the subtitles helped distract attention from the horrendous performances.at the beginning of the screening i attended, the presenter briefly talked about the history of turkish cinema and at one point mentioned that early turkish cinema was appropriately named "stage cinema" since many of the filmmakers and actors involved were people from the theater scene.ironically, this movie falls right into that category. english speakers reading subtitles may think that turkish is a naturally loud language and attribute all the yelling in the movie to that, but observant native commentators will immediately notice that all the actors are performing with exaggerated loud voices. you could attribute this to the amateur nature of all actors, but the biggest source of "yelled-out-dialog" is the main character, played by the only professional actor in the movie. not surprisingly his background is in theater. my guess is that in response to his loud delivery of lines, all other amateur actors raised their voices as well, hence turning the whole movie into a series of unnatural performances.put on top of all of this a storyline that develops at a snail's pace, you get an extremely boring movie.i have to say i also have a personal problem with turkish movies that depict entirely rural life with shallow uneducated characters. ever since "zugurt aga", one of the best turkish movies ever made, turkish filmmakers seem to be not able to avoid the appeal of the rural part of the country. this is only interesting in small doses and if it is as beautifully orchestrated with excellent writing and directing as in zugurt aga. most often, however, it is extremely boring and frankly somewhat embarrassing to native "urban" turks. rural communities make up a neglected, undereducated part of the country, and while this provides good material for comedy, it comes at a huge cost to turkey's image.a western audience member whose only exposure to turkey is this movie will undoubtedly think that turkey is like afghanistan. i wish filmmakers would realize this and let go of their passion for the stories of the "rural man" and stay loyal to the majority of the country, who live in cities that put metropolitan areas in europe to shame.

although promoted as one of the most sincere turkish films with an amateur cast, ice-cream, i scream is more like a caricature of sincerity.the plot opens with the dream of ali, a traveling ice-cream salesman in a western anatolia town, in which he sees himself becoming successful using the same marketing methods of big ice-cream companies. he dreams of playing in his product's tv commercial with beautiful models in bikinis, dancing around him. as his dream turns into a nightmare, he wakes up with a big erection next to his gargantuan wife, who rejects to make sex with him for 6 years with no apparent reason. is it because he is not successful in his job? apparently, because he says he was selling better in the old days when there was no pressure from global ice-cream companies. but this is what he says; we actually don't see him suffer that much: he still sells good, traveling the neighboring villages while his apprentice stays at the shop, selling ice-cream to the people in the town. ali blames big companies for using sweetening and coloring agents while he is using real "sahlep" (powdered roots of mountain orchids). ali buys a motorbike with a bank loan to be a traveling vendor, and gives ads to a local tv channel which prefers to broadcast even the news bulletin in local dialect. his wife is not fond of his ways of doing business, they always quarrel, and ali threatens her that he may do very bad things in a moment of frenzy.in a very successful day, his lousy bike is stolen by the misbehaving little boys of the town. in search of his stolen bike, ali goes to the police, blames the big companies for the theft, but, of course, nobody takes him seriously. annoyed by the nagging of his wife, ali goes to a tavern and becomes drunk. one of his friends at his table, a wannabe socialist of the town, gives a didactic speech and criticizes globalism, and with no real connection, jumps to the subject of global freezing. ali returns home and decides to kill himself with poison. his wife wakes up and prevents him. an old neighbor takes him to a night walk and advises him about life. according to him, ali can even sell hot sahlep drink if the world faces with global freezing. when he returns home, suddenly we see that his wife understood his value, treating him like a hero and praising his manhood. meanwhile, the thief boys got sick eating too much ice-cream. they confess to the doctor that they stole ali's bike. ali forgives them and there comes the happy end.although the plot may look promising in a way, it's the story-telling which makes this film insincere and cheesy. first, the director doesn't show much of an effort to tell the story visually; everything is based on dialogs. and the dialogs never stop to show us that cinema is actually a visual art. even ali's troubles are not convincing because we don't see it, we just understand it from his words. the director markets his film as a righteous fight of ali against big ice-cream companies, but there is nothing in the film about big companies. we don't see their pressure enough. the film actually ridicules ali for believing that big companies are behind the theft. and when his motorbike is found, it solves every problem: ali becomes a happy and powerful husband. not a real criticism of globalism.second, the film is cheesy because of the crude humor. maybe the people of that part of turkey is cursing so much and making so many vulgar jokes in their daily life, but vulgar language and crude humor are not enough to make a film funny. i may have accepted it if they were both vulgar and "clever" but they are not clever jokes at all, they are just cheesy. maybe i'm wrong, maybe american people may like oriental version of american pie style humor. but american pie never had any claim to be a nominee for the oscars, or to have a political message! if you think that you can laugh by just seeing a man's big erection in his shorts (and we had to endure this joke twice!) or an old villager woman saying "f**k you," then you may find this film funny.

i have to admit that in spite of all media promotion and being nominee for oscar, my expectation from the film was not so high before watching it. and i really found what i expected; a film trying to be likable for both for conservatives and liberals in turkey, trying being authentic for foreign spectators and enough funny for all. but it should be understood that it is not possible to be favorable for everybody, therefore film stays as average for all.whole movie is telling a story occurred within 24 hours. to fit the short story in a full movie length, some scenes are added without a connection with the main story. these are mostly the ice-cream selling scenes to the eccentric local people (i.e. goat herdsman, old women etc.), and each of these selling scenes are tried to be interesting to the spectators by skits with comic dialogs. the subject is mentioned as a universal problem: struggle of a local producer-tradesman against holding companies and monopoly, but this was the interesting subject of twenty years before. most of the readers will remember the "hero grocer against supermarket" from ferhan sensoy in 1980's. this was the correct story at correct time. shortly the story is not strong enough and worth to be a movie as by now.except some gibbers due to local accent, the performance of cast is so successful. the leading role is played by turan ozdemir with excessive body language but anyway he is successful too.on the other hand against limited budget, appreciable efforts of director and players are obviously giving a good mood to the film. but this is not resulting a film well enough either to compare with italian neo-realists or worth to be oscar nominee.note: in the real life, normally the ice-cream seller would stop his own production and be the dealer of one of the competitors of manda brand.

as someone who loves baseball history, especially the early 20th century in which cobb was a main figure, along with a ton of colorful characters, i was looking forward to seeing this baseball film. well, it wasn't a baseball film, which was disappointing. no, it was just a sportswriter's account of being with cobb in the ballplayer's later years while the two collaborated on a book. even at that, this could have been a more appealing movie than they made it.granted cobb was anything but a nice guy, an extremely talented player but brutal in that he would do anything to beat you....and he was viscous, intimidating and had a lot of demons to fight. he was so hated his own teammates tried to hinder his chances of winning a batting title one year. nonetheless, this an over-the-top portrayal of the man. it makes him into something almost cartoon-like. watching and listening to an old man rant, rave and profane for two hours is entertainment? no, it isn't. some day, i'd love to see a real biopic of cobb showing him in his ballplaying days and if they want to portray him as an evil guy, so be it, but the way they did it here with just a bitter, blasphemous old man making an ass of himself in front of a reporter is not fun to watch.

cobb. it sucked. i learned nothing about the man i had not heard before. the performances were over the top. a scene where cobb and al are driving down a snowy road in search of women in reno has to be one of the worst conceived scenes in recent memory. it's just plain stupid and unentertaining. the flashback sequences were terrible. and they used the same sequences over and over and over again. if i saw the same shot of cobb fighting with someone at a base one more time, i would have become physically ill. by watching this 'movie', we get to learn nothing of what it was like in cobb's era. we learn nothing about his relationship with his players, nothing about his days as a manager, nothing about his relationship with his family members, other than that `they don't like him'. i thought when i sat down to view this film i would learn something about the era of baseball in which cobb played. instead, all i got to see was a retread of how cobb hated everything and everyone, and how they hated him. boy, what a great movie (sarcasm intended). cobb is portrayed as a constant liar in the film, so which one of his stories is supposed to be accurate? who knows? who cares? no one will after viewing this piece of crap. if you decide to rent this film, make sure the fast forward button on your vcr is working, as you will be tempted to use it repeatedly. hopefully someday someone will make a good film about ty cobb. i liked this film about as much as the people in it liked cobb, which is to say - i hated it. now i know why i found it in the rent one get one free section of the video store. i think i will ask for my fifty cents back from the video clerk, since i can't get back the time i wasted watching this trash. oh well, what could i have possibly been thinking about a movie that would feature robert wuhl.

i don't know about the real cobb but i got the distinct impression that the filmmakers' aim was to try to soften his jagged edges and reputation, not give us a true portrait of the man himself. in the movie, besides a few racist remarks, he's shown to be just another hard-nosed, cantakerous old coot (he's so full of life!) with a heart of gold(more or less). this is also the worst acting i've seen t.l.jones do(he brings nothing new or subtle to his stereotyped character). he just doesn't flesh out cobb in a way that pulls me into the movie. not for one minute did i forget that it was tommy lee jones on the screen pretending to be ty cobb. robert wuhl didnt impress either. the "comedic" elements in this movie were just distracting and didnt ring true at all. a bloody waste of time, it is

over all, it was a real good movie. though all the actors, besides jones, sucked. by the time i was half was through it i was really getting tired of seeing 'al'. only change i would have made to it would to have more flash backs, possibly with the real cobb.

ty cobb is, by far, the most interesting and belligerently insane athlete to ever live. his baseball career was unparalleled in absurd statistics, brilliant strategy, and pure unadulterated violence. every game he played in was a spectacle in human ability and cruelty. so of course, the film about him deals with none of that, instead focusing on the writing of his biography by author al stump. now this isn't such a horrible idea in theory, as cobb himself slid even further into paranoid dementia as years progressed and the stories of his crazed outbursts even as a senior are shocking even by today's desensitized standards. but instead of focusing on these events, which i guess was simply too interesting, the film is a pseudo fictionalized road film with clichéd a clichéd plot that will cause any knowledgeable cobb fan to cry vinegar tears. tommy lee jones does quite well as a crotchety cobb, but somehow manages to overplay his cartoon supervillainy. most stories about cobb are barely believable, but to make him even crazier seems both impossible and unnecessary. robert wuhl, portraying the writer al stump, is a dark vortex of nonexistent talent. he sucks the life out of every scene, trying to make this film his own nagasaki. there is a reason we never see him as a leading man anymore (arliss doesn't count. it's barely a show). even the played out, inevitable "role reversal" of cobb and stump by the end is made even worse by his pure inability to utter words that don't sound like a poor book on tape narration voice. for all the awful writing and bland film-making on display, there is one sequence which stands out as so far superior to the rest of this failure that accepting it's from the same film is near impossible. a hyper stylized flashback sequence displaying cobb's overpowering psychology and brutal athleticism while actually playing the game of baseball is pure brilliance. the camera moves in bizarre fashion and the whole event seems like a dream due to the unique playing style of the monster cobb. every slide, hit, and tackle are rendered even more forceful due to enhanced sound, and tommy lee jones owns the intensity of the master player. it makes the viewer drool over the possibilities of a true biopic of cobb in his prime with the same actor. it's worth watching the film for this incredible few minutes alone, just to see what could have been. i may be slightly unfair to this film due to my own knowledge of ty cobb and wanting it to be something it isn't, but to make such boring, neutered movie about this maniac is nonsensical. i'm glad ron shelton's career has slid ever since.

i have to admit i was deceived by the title and the summary on the back of the box. so i popped it in the vcr and kept waiting... and waiting... and waiting for something good to happen. but of course, it never does. the makers of this film should be tied to a chair and made to watch "saving private ryan". maybe they would learn something.

i like a good novelty song. no, i take that back. i love a good novelty song. i absolutely despise ggrobar on the other hand, and have from the first note i ever heard. when i found out someone had made a cartoon based on it, my head almost exploded. now that i have seen it because my kids begged me, i wish my head had exploded. it would have saved me from the excruciating misery that was this cr@pfest. first of all, making an hour long show based on a three minute novelty song is a ridiculous idea. to stretch a song like this, which had to pad like crazy just to be that long, into an entire hour, is even more ludicrous. this was poorly written, cheaply animated, poorly acted...the list goes on and on. dear god, is this ever bad.

if we really want to get serious and find osama bin laden, then we should take this stinker down to gitmo and force the detainees to watch it. they'll be singing within minutes. of course, i'm sure that making them watch this god-awful dreck violates the geneva convention in several ways. look, my 5 year old daughter isn't allowed to watch tv at home. so take her to her grandparents or cousins and she's a little tv zombie. she got up and walked away after about ten minutes. that's how bad this is. you know, when the person responsible for this garbage was a young writer, i bet he or she had dreams of the great american novel. now they have to look in the mirror every morning with the realization that they wrote what is possibly the worst hour of television in the history of the medium.and we wonder why the rest of the world hates us...

trite and tiring, the one-liners almost made me cry. my 4 year old left the room and ended up doing a puzzle. i don't know what age group this was written for, but the writer himself/herself didn't even want credit. as for the song, it's mildly amusing. at least it was a decade ago. there are many christmas movies to watch. although i've seen some many more times than this, they are still enjoyable. whenever this comes on, i try to encourage my child to watch something else. one positive note, that allowed a vote of 2 instead of 1, is that it encourages good moral values. that would have been encouraging, if anyone were watching.

wow, i swear this has never happened to me before. i only watched "golden temple amazons" yesterday and already i haven't got the slightest recollection of anything that happened in this film. that's how brilliant this movie is, i guess! by now i only remember being lured into watching it because of the incredibly attractive dvd cover art, showing a torrid drawing of a voluptuous amazon preparing her bow to fire at an unspecified target. i often get fooled by appealing dvd covers  especially jess franco ones  and i still haven't learned to resist even after literally hundreds of awful experiences. oh well after reading the other user-comments, some parts of my memory returned although i still suspect to confuse this film with another jess franco masterpiece i watched the day before, namely "diamonds of the kilimanjaro" (and, yes, that one had an awesome dvd cover as well)."golden temple amazons" opens with a posse of hot white african amazons  i am aware of the contradiction but don't blame me  slaughtering the parents of a fragile young girl because they were trespassing the turf with the intention of stealing the golden treasures from the temple. several years and hormonal changes later, the girl returns to the jungle to get her revenge. she's accompanied by a bunch of sleazy adventurers who are less interested in the act of vengeance but wouldn't mind taking some gold back home. the rudimentary premise is obviously secondary to all the showcasing of ravishing female nudity and gratuitous sleaze. analía ivars, eva léon and the other nameless amazons are all regular franco choices and willingly walk around with their breasts proudly exposed. you better enjoy gazing at all these perfect female curves, as the rest of "golden temple amazons" is a boring and incompetent mess. there's hardly any violence or action and no less than half of the film is pure filler, bits and pieces of national geographic documentaries edited into the story and that sort of stuff. the awesome dvd cover would definitely be a great addition to your collection, but opening the box is utter pointless.

. . . and that is only if you like the sight of beautiful woman with nice, bouncy jugs running around the so called african jungle. so no problems there for most males out there.i watched it as one of those bundled together package. forget about the plot which is essentially just a flimsy storyline to get our heroine flashing her jugs on screen at every opportunity possible. just to give you a sense, our heroine swings from vine to vine and climb on top animals at every chance possible for no good reason at all just to let you see her jugs at all angles. again, no complaints.the "fight scenes" are laughable and borderline on the pornographic. our heroine got caught by the baddies at least five times in the movie. on occasions when she has to fight, the "fighting" involves rolling around in the dirt, grunting unconvincingly and basically fighting like kittens. i am surprised no hair pulling is involved. it get so bad that the chief baddie had to remind the "combatants" that "i said, the one that draw first blood wins!" in order to avoid watching anymore stupid fighting.the witch doctor kuku was a bloody blast. from being a big, cuddly bear in the beginning, he became manic depressive when captured and then, outright psycho. he spent the whole movie muttering lines with no irrelevance.beside liana (our heroine)bouncing around topless, you also get to see plenty of other amazonians as well as one woman who decided to jump naked into the lake to take a swim for no good reasons. yeah, it is that kind of movie.watch the beautiful liane in her bouncy glory. despite the movie being more than 20 years old, the allure of watching blond women flashing their nice jugs on screen never gets old.

years ago, i used to watch bad movies deliberately. somehow i missed this one. no gesture rings true. no facial expression fits the scene or the action. i've never heard such inappropriate music for a film. at the final scene, i was rooting for the car to run over that ridiculous kid - one of the worst child actors ever.only one name in it i ever heard of - wilford brimley. he must've been very hungry to take this part.do not under any circumstances, watch this movie!!! you've been warned!!!

racing enthusiast fabian (as tommy callahan) smokes, drinks, and suffers blackouts while juggling feelings for alluring brunette annette funicello (as francie madsen) and blonde mainstay diane mcbain (as annie blaine). complicating matters are ms. funicello's boozy race car boyfriend warren berlinger (as eddie sands), and her father jan murray (as pete madsen), who encourages the reckless drivers. funicello's cow-eyed performance is sometimes enjoyable; however, her drunken driving scene is unnerving. "thunder alley" provides marginally more nascar excitement than its predecessor, "fireball 500" (1966) *; be warned, it isn't much. a wild party scene, featuring some mild strip tease, is the film's low highlight.

thunder alley finds fabian banned from nascar tracks after causing the death of another driver. stanley adams might want to put him on his team of racers, but the other drivers aren't for having him around.desperate for employment fabian hooks up with an auto stunt show owner jan murray who's paying him peanuts and trying to capitalize on fabian's bad rep. he's got to take it, but annette funicello who's murray's daughter provides another reason to stick around.the rest of the film is fabian's struggle to get back to the nascar circuit while at the same time juggling both annette and his current girl friend diane mcbain. personally, i would have taken mcbain, she has it all over annette.thunder alley is helped by location shooting at the southern nascar tracks and good film footage of nascar racing. not helped by a rather silly story which delves into the real reason for fabian's problems and his rather unrealistic recovery from same.still fans of nascar might go for this.

ladies and gentlemen.. be sad (or be glad !).. we are in the disgusting forensic t.v series-era !! now count with me and anathematize our luck :"csi: crime scene investigation", "csi: miami", "csi: ny", "ncis", "crossing jordan", "da vinci's inquest", even "the cosby mysteries" !..didn't we already have enough ?!from the late 1990 till the late 2000s we've got almost the same sick series about the genius criminologist with a partner (or a team) who go to solve crimes by scrutiny the autopsy ..and what a nauseating mission to do. so you will have for sure lots and lots of repellent scenes where we see clearly, accurately and awfully the most horrific shots in the history of t.v.oh god.. once we had the great days; the good cop (or detective)era such as columbo, kojak, magnum, and simon & simon. or the good old sci-fi era, like the six million dollar man, the bionic woman, knight rider. and oh boy we've got also the hot & sexy such :cover up, the love boat, baywatch, even a flop as thunder in paradise.all of those were unforgettable, original, had good..real good thoughts, action, women ..till the x files came.. and then it was the beginning of the misfortune or to be exact : the catastrophe!x files undoubtedly was one of the greatest, but there was a few slight disadvantages, we had have agent dana scully (medical doctor and fbi agent) at every episode doing an autopsy ..,and of course her lap (as the series succeed) became part of our living room, so the thirsty-for-money producers loved it with all the physical terror + the exciting hunt for the truth.. therefore they tried to repeat it in another not too far classification : the forensic !but it became so ugly, full of deformation, and very cruddy just like bones. plus the unsexy present of emily deschanel, and bleeder as david boreanaz (he was much better in angel), and all of these corpses .. to the extent that every time i've watched it i found my self screaming aaaahhhhhh !! what a terrible gross !!..cancel it please.. you've canceled before real good shows such as (the lone gunmen) or (a man called hawk). here it's a bad one.. so please.. little mercy and enough with the bones-era !!!.. or we'll drop dead ourselves of nausea and monotony !!

i am a regular reader of kathy reichs' temperance brennan novels. as such i am extremely surprised she even consulted on this show.it is horrible by comparison to the books. the temperance brennan character is, in the books, a down to earth recovering alcoholic and divorced mom of a college aged daughter. in 'bones', she is an arrogant (rhymes with rich), who, in typical p c fashion, is not a mother. the emphasis on her assisting staff, complete with lurid details of who has had how many sexual exploits, is totally in contrast with the books.in total deference to the p c movement, she portrays the enemies of the u s as peace lovers (!). some of the information isn't even correct, for example, having a character from afghanistan as an active member of an arab-american friendship group. since when is an afghan an arab?! i'm sure if negative references were made to 'disadvantaged minorities', or women, or glbt's, the show's producers/writers/directors would have to issue an apology. however, in typical far left fashion, all of the racial slurs go to the highest achieving minority group--asians, as david boreanaz' agent booth continually refers to angela montenegro as a 'squint'.forget that stuff, and forget this show. after 'the man in the suv' episode, i thought i'd try a second episode to see if it got any better. it only got worse! i don't even care if the teenager in question was murdered or committed suicide, and i won't be watching the show ever again.

dude...i liked buffy and angel as much as the next sci-fi freak...but this is too much. the worst lead actress ever!! not even david "hot pants" boreanaz is able to save this crap. no wonder i never watch fox  it blows!! we totally gave it a chance, and it continued to suck. we watched four or five painful, agonizing episodes. i want to kill the execs at the network so bad! why is money being spent on this drivel?!?! i don't get it and i don't support it and you should never waste your time watching this show...unless you like it when your eyes bleed from their sockets! crap. crap. crap.

this is so bad i don't know where to begin.the lead role is a good starting point. it is a supreme mary sue character that has few things in common with the original one from the book, who was (a bit) more credible. no, this one is invincible, infallible, indomitable, and insipid even beyond the overinflated standards that this "chicks with swords" era that our medias are spinning out of late. she is a twenty-something top-model, thin as a match yet rich, already a leader in her academic field, a kung-fu master, a natural sniper and seems to have enough authority to naturally trump anyone official like puny fbi agents. she is god.to balance it out, she is supposed to be socially awkward (due to her typically harsh upbringing that transformed her into a "spock") which gives us some delighted moments where she wonders what is "star wars", or "american idol", but yet when it's really important she can conveniently reveal herself as a top negotiator and diplomat, because she is so superior, ya know. to top it out, she is played by a wooden actress.the more talented boreanaz serves as a faire-valoir token for this construct, acting as a bumbling comic-relief and house "watson". in fact, everything in there is a pop-parody of better works like sherlock holmes, csi and x-files, from which it tries to emulate the sexual tension between main protagonists. it is however cheaper, as this is delivered with all the subtlety of an elbow poke in the ribs, but a million million poor factory girls will doubtlessly buy into it, hence the crazy rating this turkey gets.in fact, the lowest common denominator goes a long way in this sad puppy, resulting in titillating sex details from the legion of sidekicks that aim to pass it out as daring and trendy, while the overall tone of the show carries an obvious neo-conservative view on things.story-wise, there's not much here to feast upon, as crimes (that always start out with some gruesome remains) are resolved using non-existent technology while the "squints", lovable but so wrong (the women less than the guys) goes on varied theories, all of them futile as the main character has it all from the start, and once it is established she goes out and then punch the guy, typically a real tough hombre, with a spin kick here and a slapper there. the end.

the first season of bones is playing in finland and i can't believe the amount of bullshit that this show puts on - the characters are shallow, poorly directed and clumsy.it's a poor mans' csi. or actually, csi without coherent plot. although bones has potential, it fails due to the lacking of the director who hasn't been able to extract the essence of the show from the actors. it's actually sad to see a show throw it all away when it could had been a descent show with just a pinch more thought. from the start you get the feeling how awkward the acting is.long story short - don't waste your time on bones.

i just finished watching one episode(s1-#5 a boy in a bush), so maybe my review is not very fair.but based on that episode, this is a very poor version of csi, the acting is crap. the main character, dr whatever her name is, is so fake it actually hurts. i wouldn't cast her to do an add for dog food!the other hurtful thing is david boreanaz of the "angel" fame, a good actor, does a great job, but wasted coz of the idiotic acting of that woman.supporting cast is ok, but all is ruined due to this stupid acting of emily deschanel .very disappointing version of csi, very sorry to see it appear on the filmography of some of the potential talents involved in it.that woman is really sh#t, at least in that episode. but based on this one view, i will not even invest watching it even if it was shown on an elevator screen.

in my opinion, a good documentary - especially one dealing with controversial political issues - should be informative and as unbiased as possible. the point should be revealing the truth. this means, in particular, having among the interviewees experts on the subject and representatives of all sides. this film is a failure in this regard. most of the interviews included in this film consist of "men off the street" expounding on the question of peace in the holy land. the wall itself, the supposed subject of the film, is given no serious treatment at all. for most of the interviews, the interviewer simply waits to be approached and asks general questions such as "what do you think of the wall?" - she does not approach random people near the wall and ask them how they have been directly affected by it. outside of one interviewee, the israeli general in charge of the wall's construction, we have no "experts" on the subject to provide us with the wall's context (e.g. how and when the project began, whether it has been successful, which groups are for and which against the project, etc.)outside of the interviews, a very large portion of the film consists of extended shots of uneventful scenes, such as head-on shots of the wall, construction of the wall, and people getting off a bus. these shots take up far too much time, in my opinion. it's nice to see what the wall looks like, but the 20-30 minutes of head-on filming of the wall (and only the wall) are excessive. clearly, these shots (accompanied by arabic music that conveys a sense of mourning) are included for the sole purpose of arousing in viewers feelings of loathing for the wall.

this movie is so bad it's almost good. bad story, bad acting, bad music, you name it. o.k., who are the jokers that gave this flick a '10'?

i was told jon was for awhile on spiritual experiences. i guessed the film will be interesting.in fact isn't at all. not so much profound for a such subject. "eternity" never-ending life. experiences after death and "dejavu". the film is not as a comedy but isn't funny at all, at least not express yet. it's so naive. charming film but naive film. a must to avoid. the middle ages sequences seems coming directly from fairy tales and it's not the matter at all. eileen davidson is so charming and voight is doing his best. normal is a co producer and screenwriter of this movie. the film was launched straight on video so i discovered it on a video store. it's a pity 'cause i well know voight was seriously involved with spirituality and the film isn't so much profound about it.

i can't figure out what jon voight could possibly have been thinking when he got involved in this tenth-rate, incoherent, pretentious, mind-numbing slop. he helped to write the alleged "script" himself, and he should be damn well ashamed of it. the film (i can't call it a "movie" because it barely moves at all) is rambling, embarrassingly pretentious drivel--sort of like a really bad oprah winfrey show, but worse. it meanders senselessly back and forth from medieval times to modern-day los angeles, with voight as a television producer who thinks he is the reincarnation of a medieval prince who must save the kingdom from the machinations of his evil brother, and somehow this gets transferred to modern times where voight has to save the country from the evil machinations of an oil company executive. if the bizarre casting (wilfrid brimley, frankie valli (!), kaye ballard and armand assante, among others) isn't enough to kill it, the stupefyingly inept direction, the washed-out photography (it looks like it was shot with a really cheap 16mm camera), the almost complete lack of editing (scenes either go on and on endlessly or are chopped off in the middle of a sentence), and voight's embarrassing, apparently stream-of-consciousness "acting" are enough to bury it, which is exactly what should have been done with it. a jaw-dropping experience. avoid this dog at all costs.

this is the lamest, crappiest, idiotic, stupid movies i ever saw in my entire life... i can't believe there are directors who make these kinds of movies... this movie is a disgrace to horror genre... acting ??? oh! no !!! i couldn't bear... it's full of anguish... don't ever watch this movie... you'll feel like u are being tortured to eternity... please, save yourself from the horrible fate of watching this movie... if you really want to live, don't watch it... there are very good horror movies... this movie doesn't deserve tat single vote too... but, i hate to vote if i want to post my comments...

this movie was bad and the movies about how some college students stay at a house to get money by renovating it and then they find out that the house has a woman deamon in it and that there is a portal to hell.in this movie there are heaps of stupid scenes like at the start of the movie how they are cleaning the house and they start to dancing to a cheesy song and some of the demons at the end of the movie are just some guys in bad costumes trying to make scary sounds and there are some good gore scenes like when the professor gets his face ripped of.i only hired this movie because i am a big fan of horror movies and its only worth watching if u are a fan of horror movies.the acting in this movie is really bad the only good actor is roy scheider from the great movie jaws and over all this movie has heaps of flaws and my rating is 4 out of 10.

a rather mild horror movie; if not for a couple of sex scenes, it could easily have been a tv movie. plot holes abound (one example: why would there be a secret passage from the 18th century leading from the upper floor of a house that was burned to the ground and a new building put ther 200 years later?), cardboard acting, characters doing things that anyone with an iq bigger than their shoe size wouldn't do...it's got a few fun moments, but overall it's a sub-par film that managed to get roy scheider because his bills were due. if you're looking for an extremely formulaic, predictable film that might provide a few laughs, it might be worth watching. if not, then this one's not for you.

this sequel to the above - and the final entry in the "kharis" series - is slightly more enjoyable on the whole but it's also more contrived (hell, we even get a singing barmaid/hostess!): peter coe is easily the least charismatic of the various egyptian high priests we've seen during the course of these films, and martin kosleck as his henchman seems uninterested in the proceedings; kurt katch, then, is saddled with a ridiculous accent as the man who discovers the newly reincarnated princess ananka: the latter, in the form of virginia christine (later a much-used character actress) gets her most substantial 'role' and, indeed, the sequence of her resurrection from the swamps is a highlight not only of this film but the entire series. unfortunately, here too, chaney has precious little to do as once again the emphasis is on ananka, as i've said; his mummy (to which he returned most often at universal - apart, naturally, from his signature role of the wolf man!) remains, without a doubt, his least memorable monster for the studio.

i was watching the sci-fi channel when this steaming pile of crap came on. while not as bad as wynorski's "curse of the komodo", this still sucks...bad. wynorski uses the same island as in "curse of the komodo", as well as the same actors and house. the effects are top notch (suprising) but thats about it........i don't know what else to say about this movie.......oh yeah! as in "curse of the komodo", the government gets involved and decides to bomb the island! also....when i saw this part i laughed hysterically...a komanbra!!! (part man, komodo and cobra!). overall this movie is utter crap even on bad movie standards. just remember if jim wynorski had anything to do with a movie....steer clear....to avoid from falling asleep keep repeating "it's almost over..it's almost over...". 0 out of 5.

jim wynorski strikes again with the very literal minded komodo vs. cobra. no guesswork here. a giant cgi komodo dragon -- it sort of looks like a dog minus fur -- takes on a humongous cgi king cobra, with a bunch of tree huggers and others caught in between. the tree huggers get charter boat captain michael pare (who else?) to take them to an off-limits federal island. an experiment by a mad scientist in growing very large veggies has become an experiment in growing very large critters, thank so to our nutty military. now all that's left on the island are the very large critters and the mad scientist's tiny, shapely daughter. the group runs into her at the old plantation lab, the monsters arrive, and the chase is on. if you watch enough wynorski/sci-fi channel flicks, you'll recognize some of the sets and locations from many other movies. acting is nonexistent, as is the plot. at the very least, you can enjoy watching the badly animated compo/dog stomp down on its intended victims just before scarfing them up. the cobra just strikes and swallows. no imagination at all.

probably the worst creature feature ever,boa vs python was a million times better then this & that wasn't great either,bad acting,bad effects & guess what the dvd is one of those one with 3 hours of previews before the main menu.probably the least scary movie ever,no blood or violence,people are stupid and keep using pistols when they have no affect on these animals, the only cool part was the radioactive leeches that was pretty cool,i name of the island is just a rip off of jurassic park boring tiring & not worth even looking at but i suppose the characters stupidity is pretty funny so it would make a good comedy film but definitely not a thriller

laughable would be a good term to describe this movie. but, since this movie deserves nothing good said of it, i'll use the term god-awful instead.centering around the adventures of a bunch of eco-warriors investigating the nefarious doings of the military on a semi-tropical island, the lack of a budget rapidly becomes apparent. michael pare (a real actor! but only in the sense that pinocchio was a real boy...) leads the bunch of fools through a series of monster chase-and-gobble-hapless-victim scenes. there is some vague attempt at pseudo-science to explain the presence of the giant reptiles, but it convinces the viewer about as well as the acting does.as if this doesn't insult the viewer enough, the movie also features what i'll call "guns of never-ending ammunition". i never saw mickey parrot or his female side-kick change clips once during the entire film, yet i can positively report they cap off at least 40 rounds each in any scene where they are required to fire their weapon. forty rounds may not seem like that many, but we are talking standard handguns here. i figure 15 round clip, tops. and remember, they never change clips, nor even appear to carry any extra ammo.it's dumb-assery like this which consigns movies to the eternal fires of celluloid hell, and rightly so. the third-rate cgi does little to help matters and the acting is best laughed at, else you'll start crying. why scifi channel repeatedly churns out this mush is anyone's guess.my advice....give this one a wide berth...a very wide berth!

i just found out before writing this review that "komodo vs. cobra" and another movie called "curse of the komodo" were both directed by the same guy, jim wynorski. that might explain why they are films of nearly identical premises. they both feature a military-governed island, a colonel whose concerned more about covering his tracks than the lives of his employees, people racing to get to a chopper that is conveniently lying in a field somewhere on the island, and giant komodo dragons created through genetic experiments running amok. what differences are there? well, the intruders on the island are now capitalists wanting to expose the government secret and there's a giant cobra on the island as well, hence the title "komodo vs. cobra" even though the conflict between the two monsters is hardly relevant to the 'story.' "komodo vs. cobra" is more or less what you'd expect given its title and its channel origin: the sci-fi channel. although every now and again you will find one that for one reason or another may appeal to you (i liked a movie called "komodo") i hardly doubt this one will."komodo vs. cobra" is not only a boring film, but it's also one of the least enthusiastic sci-fi flicks i've seen in a long time. in some of these movies, there is an air to them that indicates the filmmakers were giving at least a certain level of effort, but i see very little here. that's indicated again by it just being a rehash of "curse of the komodo." the cgi for the monsters look as if they came straight out of a second-rate video game, the cinematography and misc en scene is poor, the acting ranges from passable to poor, the action scenes are dull, and then there are some parts that are, frankly put, unforgivably bad. i see a lot movies where a person will shoot a gun many times without reloading and i can deal with this. but in this movie, where michael paré takes a single thirty-eight handgun and fires it approximately fifty times nonstop without reloading oncewell, at first i laughed, but even then it just became tiring. that would be the 'action.' a monster appears, people scream, paré fires nonstop without reloading his gun once throughout the entire picture, and somebody gets eaten."komodo vs. cobra" is a very bad movie. the only thing in the movie that is worth mentioning in a charitable manner is an actress named michelle borth, who is not only very beautiful, but a surprisingly strong performer. even with the trashy dialogue and lack of enthusiasm in the screenplay she was given, michelle borth managed to pull off a surprisingly good performance and it just appalls me that an actress as good as her can get stuck in a film as junky as this. she obviously took it for the paycheck, but it won't boost her career any, i'm afraid.

writer & director jay andrews, a.k.a. jim wynorski, serves up more of his characteristic shlock with a decent cast menaced by grade-z computer generated reptiles in "komodo vs. cobra," as generic a rip-off of "mysterious island" meets "jurassic park" as you can imagine. the chief problem with this predictable yarn about monsters dining on mankind is the incredibly phony special effects. the cobra and the komodo are hilariously awful. however, the graphics people do an okay job of integrating the monsters with their victims, not that any of this is in the least believable. clearly, "komodo vs. cobra" had a budget that so low that virtually everything non-human in its looks as fake as all get out. this cheesy monster epic takes place on a remote island where the u.s. military conducts top-secret dna testing on animals. the result is that gigantic komodos and cobra thrive in this tropical island paradise. as the action opens, the primary scientist is gobbled up by a cobra that likes to swim. after, we are introduced to a group of 'greenpeace' like environmental protesters and a journalist. planet one organizer jerry ryan (ryan mctavish of "hellbent") pays charter boat skipper jim stoddard (michael pare of cbs-tv's "houston knights") five grand with the promise of another five grand if he will take them to this forbidden island. meanwhile, the u.s. military suspect that something is amiss on the island so they send their own team of men who give eaten by the supersized predators. our heroes run into the last remaining scientist on the island, dr. susan richardson (michelle borth of "wonderland"), the daughter of the scientist responsible for this insane science project, who tells them that the military is going to target the island for destruction. the title match between the two overgrown predators occurs in the last quarter hour after our heroes, who have been consistently whittled down by the monsters, find a helicopter and take off in time before the military pulverizes the island. there's no tension, suspense, or anything worthwhile in this substandard creature feature. the best thing about this yawner is composer chuck cirino's orchestral soundtrack; it gives "komodo vs. cobra" an epic feel. usually, jay andrews writes and directs tolerable drivel, but this ranks far below his low standards. the sexy women fare better at survival than the guys. in one scene, our heroic group fords a river and we don't get to see any wet t-shirts. drat! there's nothing in the way of memorable dialogue or relationships in this dreck. i think that the military guys do far too much saluting when they get their heads together to conspire. let's hope that michael pare got a good payday out of this garbage. the ending as one of the scientists takes on the characteristics of a lizard comes strictly as an afterthought. it's not so bad it's good, it's just bad.

where do i start? first off, the story sucks. the acting sucks, the effects really suck, i guess i'll start with the story. the story for komodo vs. cobra: number one, it doesn't explain how or when the komodo and the cobra even got there. or for that matter, how it was created. the acting: terrible! it seems like the director just pulled a few people from the street (which is probably what he did). and last and definitely the least, the effects: they are so horrible that the komodo doesn't even look like a komodo, just a dinosaur, that looks incredibly unrealistic. the water doesn't even move when the cobra appears. all in all: terrible piece of crap, don't even think about renting it.

komodo vs. cobra starts as 'one planet' environmentalist jerry ryan (ryan mctavish) & his girlfriend carrie (renee talbert) hire captain michael stoddard (executive producer michael paré) to take them to an island in the south pacific, at first stoddard is reluctant since the island is a top secret military research base but soon changes his mind when a load of cash is offered. along with tv news reporter sandra crescent (jeri manthey) they set sail for the island & once ashore find out that the military have been funding illegal dna genetic experiments which have resulted in huge komodo dragon's & king cobra's that have eaten almost every other living thing there & stoddard & co are next on the menu...co-written & directed by the ever awful jim wynorski under his jay andrews pseudonym this is just plain awful, this is just plain hard to sit through & is even worse than the usual rubbish 'creature features' the sci-fi channel have the nerve to air if that's possible. the script is terrible, predictable & utterly boring, some giant monsters of some sort are created by scientists messing around with dna, a group of people are trapped with said monsters & have to try to escape being eaten. that's it, that's the whole plot of komodo vs. cobra, maybe this was trying to rip-off avp: alien vs. predator (2004) with the title but all the 'vs.' bit amounts to is a rubbish thirty second stand-off between the two titular beasts at the very end, boring as hell & surely a big disappointment to anyone hoping to have a full on monster mash. the character's are poor, the dialogue is awful, the pace is slow, the story is predictable & cliché ridden & the whole film just sucks really with a lazy script that states wrongly that both komodo dragon's & cobra's are amphibious which they are not. hell, komodo vs. cobra isn't even worth watching for any unintentional laughs since it's so dull & hardly anything ever happens although the sight of a woman hiding behind the smallest rock on the beach from the cobra is quite funny for the wrong reasons.how does wynorski keep getting directing jobs? he is probably consistently the worst director currently working, how can he keep getting fun sounding films set on beautiful locations with half decent casts & still churn out such an awful film? i think this was cut to get a pg or for it's tv showing since every time someone swears it's masked by a parrot squeak! there's zero gore or violence & the monster scenes are limp, people just sort of stand there, the monsters just sort of stands there too hissing or roaring & that's about it. the cgi computer effects are terrible, this is really poor stuff that just looks horrible.with a supposed budget of about $450,000 this looks as cheap as it was, the hawaiian locations are nice to look at but that's about it. the acting is poor from an uninterested looking cast.komodo vs. cobra is an absolutely terrible sci-fi channel 'creature feature' from jim wynorski, films don't get much worse than this.

if you're looking for a movie that's fun to watch simply because you can make jokes about the not so great acting, cheesy "special" effects, and typical sci-fi plot...then this is the movie for you! not at the acting was bad, in fact, a few actors were actually fairly decent. the special effects weren't the greatest (to say the least); the animals looked completely computer animated. there was an annoying squawking to cover up the swearing and there was only one song played over and over again throughout the entire movie. overall, a good movie if you're looking for something completely cheesy and fun to make fun of. not a good movie to watch if you're looking for something serious.

this movie is hilarious what is better than watching two creatures battle one another? giant cgi versions of these beasts which battle! however i do require one of the guns used in the movie. because apparently they are using cheats. count the amount of shots they use before having to...oh wait that's right they never have to reload. regardless count the shots... it's hilarious.the sound effects used in the movie for the komodo vary from a tiger to an elephant. oh and did i forget to mention that apparently these giant komodo dragons are stealthy as hell? because somehow even when the actors are looking in the direction that the beast comes from they are surprised when it appears.whenever someone dies you can tell its coming because they all brace for it, they put their arms up in the air and cross them to save themselves... it never works.the final gem is that these script writers brains are just a gland full o' knowledge. with "facts" such as both of these creatures being amphibious to comments such as "helpless animals" they are just full of fun facts.

this is like a zoology textbook, given that its depiction of animals is so accurate. however, here are a few details that appear to have been slightly modified during the transition to film:- handgun bullets never hit giant komodo dragons. it doesn't matter how many times you shoot at the komodo, bullets just won't go near it.- the best way to avoid being eaten by a giant cobra, or a giant komodo dragon, is just to stand there. the exception to this rule is if you've been told to stay very still, in which case you should run off, until the komodo is right next to you, and then you should stand there, expecting defeat.- minutes of choppy slow motion footage behind the credits really makes for enjoyable watching.- $5,000 is a memory enhancement tool, and an ample substitute for losing your boating license/getting arrested.- members of elite army units don't see giant komodo dragons coming until they are within one metre of the over-sized beings. maybe the computer-generated nature of these dragons has something to do with it.- when filming a news story aiming on exposing illegal animal testing, a reporter and a cameraman with one camera is all the gear and personnel you will need; sound gear, a second camera, microphones etc are all superfluous.- when you hear a loud animal scream, and one person has a gun, he should take it out and point it at the nearest person.- when you take a gun out, the sound of the safety being taken off will be made, even if your finger is nowhere near the safety- reporters agree to go half-way around the world in order to expose something - without having the faintest idea what they're exposing. background research and vague knowledge are out of fashion in modern journalism.- handguns hold at least 52 bullets in one clip, and then more than that in the next clip. despite that, those with guns claim that they will need more ammo.- expensive cameras (also, remember that the reporter only has one camera) are regularly left behind without even a moment's hesitation or regret. these cameras amazingly manage to make their way back to the reporter all by themselves.- the blonde girl really is the stupid one.- the same girl that says not to go into a house because a komodo dragon can easily run right through it, thus making it unsafe, takes a team into a building made of the same material for protection - and nobody says a word about it.- high-tech facilities look like simple offices with high school chemistry sets.- genetically-modified snakes grow from normal size to 100 feet long in a matter of a day, but don't grow at all in the weeks either side.- the military routinely destroys entire islands when people don't meet contact deadlines.- men with guns don't necessarily change the direction they're shooting when their target is no longer right in front of them. instead, they just keep shooting into the air.- the better looking you are, the greater your chance of surviving giant creatures.- women's intuition is reliable enough to change even the most stubborn of minds.- any time you're being hunted by giant creatures is a great time to hit on girls half your age.- animal noises are an appropriate masking noise for 'swearing' at the same volume.- old israeli and russian planes are regularly used by the us military.

as a total movie geek with the fortunate job of video store manager, i tend to watch all sorts of movies, from good to very very bad. this was a movie with so many corn-ball lines, cheesy cgi effects and predictable plot points that i ended up laughing extensively before switching it off after 30-40 minutes. the "creature feature" genre of movies has been putting out some pretty awful stuff in recent years (godzilla 2000 anyone?), but this movie makes me think the creators weren't even trying. it might be worth checking out just for the "make fun of me" potential (count the gunshots!), but i couldn't in good conscience recommend this movie to anyone.

so, wynorski remakes curse of the komodo a second time, this time replacing the interesting characters of the original with a bunch of obnoxious environmentalists / anti-capitalists. and he adds a cobra. most of the movie is spent listening to the self-righteous characters prattle on about the evil capitalist pigs, while sandwiched between this cavalcade of condescension are flashbacks to what happened on the island before they got there. dna experiments were conducted, critters started to grow, people spoke to each other without coming off as being morally superior jerks, etc. needless to say, it would have been a much better movie if they would have made the flashbacks the movie and forgotten about the sanctimonious do-gooders. lest i forget, there are a few short scenes scattered here and there where the holier-than-thou posse gets picked off one by one, but they probably comprise less than 2% of the film. the main event pitting our title characters against each other lasts about one minute and is as exciting as watching the previews for the latest dino-crisis video game.the acting is pretty bad overall, even for this sort of film. half the actors seem like they're more concerned with pronouncing every last syllable of every word than speaking their dialog in any sort of believable manner.i actually did make it through to the end, but it's one of those movies i wish i would have recorded and then watched later, because there are plenty of parts that need to be fast forwarded through. overall, i give this effort one star, it has absolutely none of the elements that make a b-movie fun to watch. it's a sad day indeed when you can say with sincerity that the makers of this movie could have learned a thing or two from watching boa vs. python.

a group of environmentalists travel to an island to uncover a secret lab that is experimenting on animals. when they arrive, they discover that they are to late. apparently the government made a scientist test his experiment on a komodo and, yes, you guessed it, a cobra which made them grow very large. i'm not sure that this movie really needed or deserved explaining since it is almost identical to curse of the komodo which also sucked. the computer effects are as cartoony as ever an the komodo roars like a dinosaur which really got on my nerves. like boa vs. python, this movie is not worth seeing and is about as much fun to watch as it is to nail your hand to a table. avoid!

why are there no good reviews? because this film is hysterically bad.set in a japanese prison camp in world war ii, we have jim brown as the hero who puts up with a hysterically unbelievable racist officer, and just as hysterical is the way the japanese officers brown nose jim brown's character.this is probably the worst film any of these actors ever did. stereotypes not only abound, but they dominate this film. the sixties-seventies music may be the best thing about the film, maybe because it has nothing to do with the film.this is even difficult to sit back and enjoy as mindless fun. this film is even more racist than the message of racism it tries to deliver. and believe me, i was alive in the seventies, and we thought crap like this was just as stupid then. it was never popular.

if you are in to bad movies for the entertainment of witnessing bad movies, bad acting, bad production etc..aka mystery science theater 3000 quality....you will love pacific inferno. jim brown will be forever remembered as one of the greatest football players to ever play the game...as an actor he will forever be remembered as one of the greatest football players to ever play the game... i am not sure who rolf bayer was...but i am hoping he was 15 or 16 years old when he directed this, perhaps he may have been the next spielberg in the making...because if he was a grown man directing this...a 15 or 16 year old could have done better.... the basis or plot for the movie probably had some historical merit and maybe even truthfully accurate...but the actual film may be one of worst movies made in american film history...i kept waiting for lee marvin, william holden or charles bronson to pop in to somehow save whatever "face" was left of this film. i would have loved to have been at the red carpet, black tie gala for the hollywood opening when this movie previewed...as this movie had to have many a viewer laughing and cringing under their breath... it is on the dime dvd racks now....look for it for entertainment value...this movie is so bad it is too good to pass up...

the best thing about this flick is that it seems like they used a lot of stuff left over from the pearl harbor attack in tora tora tora. my favorite was the shot of the p-40 crashing into the row of parked p-40s but filmed from the top of a hangar or crane. unfortunately it just gets worse from there.there's two black guys and two white guys as american pows, as well as some filipinos pows and japanese guards. the ranking pow of the americans is a white naval lieutenant, which is of course an o-3 in the navy. at any rate, he's in need of a haircut, badly, distractingly badly. hockey hair does not belong in a wwii movie. oh, and he's a racist. he doesn't want to share quarters with the 'negros'. of course in real life, he wouldn't want to share quarters with the white enlisted guy either. i think the geneva convention has a clause about officers quarters and enlisted but that wasn't the point here. oh well, i think plot is secondary to other issues in this flick. he gets put in his place and pretty much spends the rest of the movie as a look out and running the air pump for the divers.but once you get going, it's not a bad story line. the japs want the divers to raise the silver thrown out by the americans before corrigador fell. the filipino resistance wants them to take their time. and the pows do their best to help. a potentially good story and not that badly done i guess. a bit unbelievable when the pows use camp made re-breathers to swim between the pow camp and the filipino village, every night. maybe i'm not that picky when i know going in that this is not a blockbuster film. i guess that's why it comes on a 20-pack dvd war movie collection for five bucks.the 70s music did not belong in this movie or any wwii movie. it's quite distracting to say the least. the acting was not that bad. probably better than i could do.not being a fan of football, at least i found out that jim brown is a real person and not somebody richard pryor made up. that in itself was worth the 25¢ i paid for this movie.worth watching on tcm or paying a quarter for. one star for being a war movie, another for being wwii and one more because i'm feeling generous.

jim brown stars and produces a tale set in the philippines just after the japanese invasion. the story has the japanese taking several navy men prisoner including some divers, who they use to retrieve the gold that macarthur had dumped into the manila bay.it's a messy movie aiming to make a statement about war and racism (the film uses edwin mccain's war in a not so subtle montage). the performances are just adequate at best. jim brown is okay, but he doesn't really show any sort of range in a performance that just has him standing there looking annoyed. the sets are serviceable but seem rather cheap. the film suffers from the outset due to a great deal of stock footage including many of the best known shots from the japanese attack in tora! tora! tora!. the use of such big budget sequence effectively makes the rest of the film look positively anemic; it also reminds one that there are better films out there one could be watching. for me the film seems to have half a real plot, the retrieval of the silver, and half a plot that is there just to fill time. none of it is particularly exciting even with the explosive finale.given the choice i'd take a pass.

this movie looked like it was rushed to release for some reason. definitely not a well made movie. so unbelievable. the scenes where the president (holbrook) were downtown and walking among the people were a farce. there would not be a chance for the common folk to be within 30 yards of the president in that situation in real life. if it wasn't for the blood and profanity, this was shot like a tv movie. it could have been decent if it was done differently. holbrook's (president) talents were never realized in this movie. shatner's acting is okay. the production values in this movie leave a lot to be desired. overall, i think most people would be better off not wasting time to watch this affair.

all i can do is echo the sentiment already expressed by some of the other commenters. this is city of god meets happy days. the bipolarity of the ruthless thug (one minute a ruthless killer, the next minute a luv's diaper commercial) is completely unconvincing. you can approach it in one of two ways: (1) a gritty, realistic movie turned sappy; or (2) a sappy, abc-afterschool-special with profanity, violence and animal cruelty. either way it just don't fly, do it? why then has it received so much praise? as others have implied, it gets the "conscience vote" from the west. show us pictures of poverty to contrast against our fluffy, double-wide theatre seats and 44-oz cokes, and we'll applaud in a heartbeat. but--oh--don't forget to candy coat it, because the bitter pill of reality (tantalizing as it is) is hard for us to swallow.i'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades, especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there. all i can say is: beware of any film that receives awards (hollywood oscars = sweeping, syrupy tripe. cannes film festival = beard-stroking, artless propaganda). to find the real gems, you'll have to work hard at it.

like most musicals of the era, one must check reality at the door. broadway melody of 1938 is not remotely believable nor plausible, but kind of fun in its strange way. this movie is really just an excuse to execute the talents of the stars. some scenes just happen as if they were in a review, not a plot driven movie.judy garland shines and it's a pity she has so little to do unless much was left on the cutting room floor.one of the most inane happenings are the way eleanor powell get a lead role in a broadway show and robert taylor says it's going to be work, work, work from dawn til dusk. several scenes go by and there's no work, no rehearsals...nothing. she needs money to win a horse in an auction. she has no money. isn't she getting paid while she rehearses? taylor has to borrow money to help. he's supposed to be a big time producer. he has no money??? anyway, that's just two elements in this strange story.the musical numbers are quite wonderful which saves this from being a total loss. broadway melody of 1940 is much better as is broadway melody of 1936.

the hindi remake of mrs doubtfire starring and directed by kamal hassan is a somewhat shoddy version, and not as good as expected.kamal hassan clearly struggles with hindi dialogs, even after all these years, and cannot handle even one scene effortlessly. the guy has aged and should give it a rest. hassan doesn't bring anything new to the role or to the character as say, dustin hoffman does to tootsie, or marathi actor macchindranath kambli does to mavshi's (aunt's) character in "moruchi mavshi" (moru's auntie, comedy play).what was the kid doing playing with firecrackers when it wasn't diwali? most of chachi's romantic 'cross-connections' -- vs amrish, paresh and then johny walker, seem redundant to the main storyline. tabu's bathing scene was unnecessary. the family is north indian but must be reminded of karva chauth night by a 'maharashtrian' chachi. yeah, right.the fine acting skills of not one but four actors namely tabu, om puri, the late amrish puri and paresh rawal have been wasted in this film.watch the original mrs doubtfire -- clean, crisp and crackling with fun, quite unlike chachi 420.

now i remember what the 'indie' filmmakers were ripping off before pulp fiction. it was david lynch, right?i hunted this thing down to see kyle secor. what a waste of a perfectly good bayliss. it was so painful to watch him, sort of like when someone you love is horribly sick and there's nothing you can do.nearly every cliche in the book: the desert, the psycho, the quirky mob boss, the biker, tracy walker (who fortunately was only in one scene, but i kept expecting him to reappear and say something strange and profound like "if a man wants to know where he's going, he's got to look at where he's been," or some contrived garbage like that). i have a theory as to why so many indies are short on location in the desert. i think it's because they can save money on lighting.if you like to be in pain, find this movie and give it a viewing. if you're a fan of kyle secor, watch reruns of homicide on court tv. if you want a good, quirky road thriller, check out wild at heart.there is a reason that no one has heard of delusion! my god, what a waste of a good title.

"delusion" is what you experience when you watch this flick and then believe you saw something worthwhile. this flick, which tells of a trio of semi-psycho travelers who are up to no good somewhere in the ca desert, is amateurish and just plain stupid. the film suffers from an awful story, a lousy screenplay, and some terrible direction just to mention a few of the deficits. if the flick has anything at all going for it, it's b-movie diva rubin's even performance. don't waste your time on this turkey. (d)

everything you do in this world should make at least a little bit of sense. unfortunately very little of "delusion" makes any sense. jennifer rubin is adequate in her role as the main squeeze of hit man kyle secor. secor on the other hand overacts to the point of annoyance. jim metzler, the embezzling yuppie is very unbelievable as the novice, revenge seeking, adversary. when jennifer rubin gives back the money she has carefully been concealing, all credibility flies out the window, and the guns pointing final showdown between secor and metzler is beyond ridiculous. avoid "delusion", unless you are delusional enough to believe the misguided positive reviews here. - merk

this turned out to be more of a women's romance-soap-suspense film than what i hoped it was....simply a tense thriller. yes, the final 20 minutes were suspenseful but much of the previous 75 bordered on being just plain tedious.ruter hauer was a little too subdued, not playing his normal intense character. natasha richardson sports somewhat of a dumb look most of the time and her character was very unappealing.the story is so-so. it's not as bad as i'm making out, but it sure isn't anything i'd watch again, and the back of the vhs describing this movie was misleading.

this is without question one of the worst movies i have ever seen. however, it is also one of the most unintentionally hilarious. i like to compare it to plan 9, in that it can be so bad, so awful,so dumb, and such a waste of time that i find myself laughing out loud.one of my biggest problems with it is that it's a complete ripoff of robin hood, and let be honest and say that i love robin hood with errol flynn, and robin hood: men in tights. but let's face it, from the forbidden love between peck (who is definitely slumming it. although in all fairness this was still a good few years before the masterpiece to kill a mockingbird) and the female character (who is so forgettable, apparently, that i have forgotten her name.), to the final scene where the good guys dress up as monks to fool the bad guys screams "robin hood" all over it.however, i don't think the film isn't worth seeing. on the contrary, i think that this is one of the funniest movies i've seen in years, even if it was unintentional.

originally i wrote what was a sarcastic,scathing review of this pathetic piece of dung,but every time i submitted the review i got "this contains a very long word which is not allowed", also words that were not misspelled were judged incorrect. now the word that was judged too long was never identified.after numerous attempts at eliminating words eventually i got the sneaking suspicion that the imdb site is politically sensitive and set to reject certain words automatically.nothing i wrote was obscene or racist in itself.but after eliminating all of the longest words the same message was repeated again and again,also words that weren't judged misspelled were all the sudden considered misspelled!the pc police are everywhere.

i watched all three mad max films in succession for the first time a few days ago and was left bitterly disappointed with the third instalment. it destroys the fine work of the first two films with weak and cheesy action and a story line that turns the apocalyptic australian wastelands into a comical sand pit one would expect to see in a children's adventure movie. the character of max is unrecognisable from his dark and cynical persona seen in the previous films and changed into a predictable uninteresting saviour that left me feeling betrayed. if you haven't seen this film yet then simply don't. let the story end with the road warrior and save yourself a very painful hour and a half. (spoiler alert) the other major issue i had with this film that truly left a bitter taste in my mouth was the flying man. we had already seen him in the road warrior where he had helped max and yet when he reappears in thunderdome it looks like the two had never met. whether he was supposed to be a different character or a relative of the road warriors gyro man i do not know. however it was not explained and is a weak element in this overall weak film. 2 out of 10. doesn't get a 1/10 because of the thunderdome fight.

even allowing for my unabashed love of the first two films in the franchise, and sweeping away any sort of biased leanings i might of had for the character of max, i just can't bring myself to rate at average this cartoonery waste of space that so nearly soils what had gone before it.gone is the rugged nasty streak that brought feeling to the character mad max rockatansky, gone is the impacting feeling of desolation in an apocalyptic world, and more crucially, gone is director george miller's passion for the franchise. the dreadful score matches the cartoon heart of the film, it seems that the makers didn't really know what to do with the amount of cash given to make this third {and thankfully last} instalment. sure the stunts are spot on {to be expected by now}, and of course miller manages to paint a barren desert landscape by purely lifting from what he has done before. yet he clearly struggled for fresh ideas with the action since the road warrior's crowning glory of the petrol tanker pursuit is replicated here, only he uses a train instead!!.it's just a very poor show that may have seemed like an ambitious turn of events back in the mid 1980s; but when viewing the three films together now, thunderdome just comes across as a director losing his edgy approach whilst sadly getting caught between the mix of comedy and fantasy action. and the truth is that neither of those genre slants would have worked singularly, in the context of this series, anyway. i give the film 3/10 purely for one real good thunderdome fight sequence, while the stunt men here deserve some credit at the very least. but this is the third time i have tried to like this film, and as glutton for punishment as i undoubtedly am, i wont be trying again, ever.

intelligent summary, isn't it?if mad max was something of a simple, straight forward, nothing special but nothing wrong either kinda film, they totally made up for it with it's sequel, the road warrior. so, in theory, with a third great film it would've been a great trilogy... now, it's not!such a huge disappointment beyond thunderdome was! it's main premise is pretty cool, with an 'underworld' (think a mix between metropolis and the time machine), but it all isn't carried out with too much conviction. add the obnoxious tina turner and the no good story-line of the people waiting for a plane, and this is just one huge stinker.maybe they can brighten things up again with part 4 (although that one is just probably gonna be 1 huge budget-explosion kinda thing), because this just isn't right.3/10.

like the previous two 'mad max' films, 'mad max beyond thunderdome' is not exception to the violence and strange plot. mad max is in a post-war society where he must destroy master blaster and get the children to 'tomorrow morrow land'. this is generally a warped film with peter pan references and tina turner, methane-pigs, and odd characters. i got very bored by watching it all, and it offered nothing to me. i did not feel inspired after watching this film; the only decent thing about this film were the extremely-odd characters that got picked off in various ways throughout the film. it's too weird for me, and it was much too dull.

every time i've seen this movie i get the same impression: some parts of it are so amazingly stupid/bad that they crack me up, they aren't intentional, and there are a lot of them; the rest is just plain bad, stupid and/or irrelevant. a movie like evil dead gets credit for being bad at it's own expense because it's the intended result-it' stupid and cheesy because sam raimi succeeded at what he was trying to do. this movie doesn't have that excuse, it's stupid and cheesy because the filmmakers failed so miserably. the crap result gets heaped on top of the crap writing and crap performances to make it a shame that the lowest rating a movie can be given is one for 'awful.' watching this movie has the same effect as listening to a billy madison essay--"everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it." i should be able to give this movie something around a -5.

don`t be fooled into thinking that this is a remake as in this years remake of the time machine is based on an earlier film . it`s not because this is a pointless re- film . that is the director has used the original camera script shot for shot similar to the " remake " of the get away from a few years ago . the scenes are identical to the original , the dialogue is identical to the original , the camera angles are identical , no attempt whatsoever is made to embellish or restructure the original script ,( but with a director like van sant at the helm we should be thankful . he sure ain`t no hitchcock ) in fact i might even be correct in saying the costumes might be the same because the private eye wears a pork pie hat. didn`t they go out of fashion in the late 1960s ? bottom line:avoid

first of all,the whole idea of remaking a classic such as "psycho" is nothing short of ludicrous.a lot of time and effort was wasted here.i am sure they are smart enough to know that they could not improve on the original,so they must have had a tribute to alfred hitchcock on their minds.however,the idea that began as a well intentioned tribute, results in being a slap in the face to the horror master.this movie is poorly produced,poorly acted,and unnecessary to begin with.the original classic stands well on it's own,even after 40 years.the event of hitch returning from the grave and coming after the people responsible for this piece of trash is unlikely,but if i were them,i would sleep with one eye open just in case.don't waste your time.

let me begin by saying that this remade version of one of the greatest ever created movies "psycho" (1960) has been nothing but a fine example of poor direction, poor acting and poor cast. the best way to describe this movie is by comparing it step by step, acting by acting and process by process to the original.alfred hitchcock, one of the greatest movie directors ever lived, had an intention to shoot the original in black and white despite the availability of color at that time. okay, people in 1960 may not have been used to bloodshed or horrifying scenes as much as we are today but that didn't prevent people from liking it and getting nominated for 4 oscars. gus van sant had absolutely no reason to release this in color except that the year was 1998. what should have looked realistic in color did not. after the shower scene norman washes his hands it is easily comprehendible that whatever was used for blood looked like some kind of red wax. once he washes off the blood his hand is red in color. about acting, perhaps there couldn't have been a better cast of janet leigh and anthony perkins in the original. perkins suited well for norman and he was incredibly natural when he smiles and talks to the stranger. hitch wanted a handsome and good actor and it worked just fine. in this version, i personally think vince vaughn looked perfect and handsome and strong to play norman's role, unfortunately his acting was nothing less than terrible. in the motel office where norman and marion have the long conversation, he had zero expression on his face and his voice and face never changes throughout. in the original in the same scene when the madhouse is described, we can clearly see the sudden change of expression on perkins's face and he looks scaringly angry although not aggressively. vince vaughn here works out the entire conversation like he's just had his lines by heart. again, terrible acting. same is with anne heche. in the opening scene in the original, we can see how tensed and nervous marion (janet) is when she drives to phoenix. she was happy in getting the money but at the same time scared for life. that's what i call acting. in the remake, heche has no signs of fear and she smiles periodically for getting the money. i don't think anyone would be "happy and smiling" when they've just stolen $400000 and the entire state police is behind them. in the shower scene, janet in the original grips the curtain, turns around and dies after getting stabbed. in the remake, heche gets stabbed, turns around, then sways the other way, has a foolish expression on her face and manages to die with great effort. again, terrible acting.there are also some specially introduced changes in this movie from the original that seems to have nothing to do with the plot line and the ongoing situation. in the scene where arbogast gets murdered, two scenes blink in between the stabs. one with a naked woman and the other with a sheep. many people including myself aren't exactly sure whether the second scene showed a sheep or a cow or whatever it was. what on earth does a beast or a naked woman have to do with an investigator's murder! the changes were just inappropriate and unnecessary. there are a couple of changes in the ending scene as well. let me add some (and the only) positive points along with that. i felt julianne moore did her job well and played a good character of lila. and william macy acted well, that was almost exactly how arbogast's character should have been played.it is common man's knowledge that the purpose and intention of a movie remake is to make the present generation aware of a movie that has a good classic plot line, and to try and make it look better than the original. and if anything has happened here according to what i just said, it is directly the opposite. unfortunately many people like me weren't impressed after watching this movie unless we came to know of the existence of an unforgettable original version. please do not watch this movie, it is nowhere near the original and the original will always remain one of the best ever created movies if not the best.

why oh why did i ever waste my time watching this film? it was given to me on video by a friend and i thought i'll watch it, it can't be that bad surely. firstly the acting is simply appalling and we're supposed to believe this is real? secondly this film is blatantly trying to copy the blair witch project (yawn) and does so very poorly. so if you want the fright of your life i would suggest that a simpson's halloween special would be far scarier. but, if you just wanted to a laugh then maybe the general crapness of this film would suffice. but overall i would avoid this film at all costs or drink a large amount of alcohol before viewing. the best bit? its only about an hour and a half, thank god.

i realize why people hate this film. and, i hated blair witch project,so go figure? this is about as staged as it gets & yes they do insult your intelligence by trying to make it seem real.i really liked the madame lalaurie storyline though it's more than likely made up. but, the main reason i like this film, is fake or not when the ghosts start attacking & kidnapping them,i get chill-bumps every time & have to look behind me as it feels like something's there with me.i know it's my imagination, but hey more than half of the drivel that is horror in today's cinemas & dvd's doesn't give me goosebumps,so that makes this a creepy delight.not for everyone, as skeptics will hate it & not for gorehounds as with a pg-13 rating there is no gore. and, the females are very annoying!you'll wish the ghosts would take them off & experiment on them before it's all said & done. ** out of *****.

no one can say i wasn't warned as i have read the reviews (both user & external), but like most of us attracted to horror movies... curiosity got this cat. (come on, we all scream at the people in the movie not to go into the dark room, but you know that's horror aficionados are always dying to know what's in there even if we know it'll be bad).the bottom line is that this movie left me angry. not because it pretends to be real (who cares...gimmicks are allowed), or because the actors and dialogue are so lame (is this an unusual event in horror movies?) or even because the movie is so bad (and i am being polite here). what really got me mad is that the film is not only a rip off of bwp, but also a half-hearted lazy rip off at that.i don't believe in sacred cows and if they thought they could outdo bwp then kudos to them, but they didn't even try. the movie was made with little effort or care and that is the most unforgivable sin in horror (or any) movie!

i think that a lot of friends of people who acted in this thing must've come on and rated it because i'm telling you, its just awful. the acting is worse than soapopera bad, the effects are like something you'd see out of a 1970 episode of doctor who, the story is, well, there is no story. and they keep using the same 2 minute song over and over and over again. and the werewolf? its like the muppets they used in wing commander, the giant cats, remember how bad they looked? the werewolf is that bad. seriously, the guy who directed this thing is terrible and should never get to direct anything else again, except maybe his son's school play, but even then, he should have to pay the audience to see it. ghostwolf is nothing but a bad joke.

this is a semi fictional memoir of an "international man" who have witnessed various political upheavals in recent 30 years.i was hoping that this film would offer unique insight into politics and war. i was also hoping that it would be touching and affecting. however, i was disappointed by this film. "chico" seemed fragmentary, with the main character, ricardo, staying in one country for 10 to 20 minutes. as could be expected, no detailed storyline could be elaborated in such time frame. the excuses of him moving to another place were often perfunctorily explained. the result was a disappointing collection of fragmented clips shot in various countries.

"the death of a performer at a broadway stage play brings a theatre critic and a police detective together as an unlikely crime-solving duo. the dead performer's niece becomes not only the object of affection for our critic, but also a prime suspect in this death, and some other murders that occur at the theatre. 'the phantom killer' sets his sights upon the young woman as his next victim; so, it is a race against time for our heroes to catch the killer," according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis.milton raison's screenplay puts a little spark in this low-budget mystery whodunit. helpfully, dave o'brien (as anthony "tony" woolrich) does well in the lead role; his skills as an actor appear to be much greater than the productions employing him. o'brien and cab driving sidekick frank jenks (as egbert "romeo" egglehoffer) would have made a fine 1950s tv detective team. leading lady kay aldridge (as claudia moore) and the supporting cast are also good. unfortunately, the story becomes meandering, and anti-climactic.**** the phantom of 42nd street (5/2/45) albert herman ~ dave o'brien, kay aldridge, frank jenks

films about the mundane are often the most interesting of all films to me, in the hands of an insightful artist who examines all the twisted little details of the mundane. the french cinema seems to often be very good at this sort of thing, and i love the french cinema.this film was about the mundane. it didn't have a much of a plot. it was just characters who lived in a town, very normal people, and stuff just happened. but it wasn't very interesting stuff, and it wasn't examined very insightfully. the film did capture a bit of a mood, but it wasn't a particularly captivating mood. and while i can't think of much that the film did specifically wrong, it failed on just about every level to do anything right.there were a lot of characters in this film. a lot of them kind of looked alike, so it was hard to figure out who was who, and what were their relations to one another. i don't mind putting some effort into understanding a film, or even watching an especially complex film more than one time to iron out the details, but this one was a puzzle not worth the solving for me.the only good thing i can really say about this film is that the cinematography was pleasant--functional, not brilliant, but pleasant. the camera often captured some nice postcard-type shots. but it rarely found the really interesting little details.i've seen a handful of not-so-good films so far at the seattle international film festival, but this was the only one that failed to get any applause when the credits rolled. i sensed a big collective sigh of relief when the film was finally over. but i suppose there are probably some people out there who would like it.4/10

screen treatment of the comedic broadway success "the gay divorce" (a title which was considered too scandalous for american moviegoers, though it was used in the u.k.) concerns a man and woman (fred astaire and ginger rogers) meeting under embarrassing circumstances while she's in the process of divorcing her spouse; they dance, argue, make up, dance, argue some more and dance some more. betty grable is very appealing in a brief bit (singing and dancing in the number "let's k-nock k-nees" with overtly sissified edward everett horton), but the star-couple looks distressed and unhappy throughout. the surroundings are screwball-sophisticated yet the characters are not more than one-dimensional. *1/2 from ****

why isn't this movie on the bottom 100? raptor is, without a doubt, the worst movie i have seen in all of my fifteen years of life. i have never before witnessed such a catastrophic mess as this. absolutely everything about it is awkward and cheaply done.nobody in the cast gives a somewhat decent performance. the dialogue is utterly incoherent and the humor is anything but humorous. corbin bernsen was the most painful part of the whole thing. i can't help cringe when i recall some of his lines, like "in or out? you're worse than a cat!" and "your lady friend isn't a very good poker player. she's just revealed her hand."the raptors are a joke. even i could make more realistic dinosaur effects than these filmmakers have shamelessly done. it is an insult to the actual velociraptors, or any dinosaur for that matter. not only that, but the killing scenes are too gruesome even for me. i don't seriously think these animals would rip their victim to shreds and throw pieces all over the ground just to make everything look gorier. besides, the blood and guts are all useless when you can see the deaths coming from miles and miles away.i am a big fan of jurassic park movies and of dinosaurs. maybe the filmmakers didn't anticipate anybody with a shred of intelligence or sense to disregard bad filmmaking to stumble upon this movie on hbo late at night, like i did. if i could say one thing to anybody involved in this film, i would have to quote dr. alan grant from the first jurassic park..."just try to show a little respect."

a gut-ripping baby t-rex is on the loose in a small western town, prompting sheriff eric roberts and animal control agent melissa brasselle (who walks through her role in a very disinterest fashion) to get to the bottom of things. they discover that a mad scientist (corbin bernsen) is, unbeknownst to the government sponsorship, continuing on with a long-abandoned us research project called operation jurassic storm (ha!) by creating an army of dinosaurs in a secluded underground lab facility. before long, our heroes become trapped inside, the marines are called in, the power goes out and the dinos are set free to make a quick lunch of everyone they can get their claws and jaws on.despite an often infuriatingly inept script full of plot holes, character inconsistencies and loose ends, this direct-to-video copy of jurassic park and carnosaur is fairly digestible trash, thanks to good production values, passable fx, the occasional laugh and plenty of brainless action.someone pointed out that an opening scene in this film was stolen from carnosaur, but anyone used to watching roger corman productions knows he allows directors to liberally reuse clips from his early films to save both time and money.score: 3 out of 10

i understand that roger corman loves to do things on the cheap, but this is just sad. i purchased this flick from the dollar bin at my local video store not a month after watching the original carnosaur. i was blown away; it was the same damn movie, with just some corbin bernesen spliced in! it reminded me of all of those 80s ninja movies that took old kung fu movies and spliced in a bunch of white ninjas running doing cartwheels with the word "ninja" written on their headbands (if you haven't seen them, check out "ninja terminator", "the thundering ninja", "black dragon" and "ninja warriors"). thanks roger corman; you just made me waste a dollar.

this movie doesn't even deserve a 1/10 this movie was a scam.i swear that at least 30 minutes of the film were deliberetly copied from carnosaur 1, 2, & 3.the whole movie "raptor" was based of the movie and that was really a pathetic attempt to be a "thriller, action packed, dinosaur" copy. i loved that movie series and seeing it be put on a movie that cant even afford or willing copy it without doing there own models is what america is coming to.i recommend you see the carnosaur movie first (all of them) and then watch this, and you will know what i mean.- spencer

ok, lets get one thing straight, i love dinosaur movies, even the bad ones. so with this in mind lets proceed. "raptor" is a truly awful film, in fact its not even a film in its own right as it is cobbled together from bits of "carnosaur", "carnosaur 2" & "primal species - carnosaur 3". there is some new footage with eric roberts as a sheriff and his busty sidekick running around looking confused, frightened or whatever it is there trying to convey (badly) on the emotional scale but then how can they react to something that was filmed several years earlier. the producers (yes roger corman i'm talking about you!) even went to the lengths of hiring 2 people from "carnosaur" to play bit parts so there grisly death scenes can be reused! so this film is the cheapest of the cheap. watch the 3 original movies, there no oscar winners but they have some meritt and entertainment value but avoid "raptor". oh, it also has the most pointless sex scene that runs for nearly 10 minutes! do you think they were trying to pad out the running time?

the storyline of this movie is cliché and obviously has been ripped off from jurassic park. the filmmakers didn't even try to hide that. it seems as though there was not enough budget to make decent dinosaur-dolls, so instead the viewer sees some robot-like toy-dinos (from a cheap toystore) which move in a very unnatural way. it's funny though, because it's so bad. the acting is almost as unnatural as the dinos are. no one seems really excited to be in this movie (which i totally understand). especially the last half hour is extremely boring and it's almost impossible to watch it without falling asleep. the one positive comment note i'd like to make about "raptor" is that it doesn't take a full 90 minutes.

so i was sick with the flu one saturday and the silver lining was that scifi channel was having a marathon of dinosaur movies that day - the "carnosaur" trilogy, "pterodactyl," "raptor island." then i flicked ahead on my cable remote to see which movie scifi placed in its glamorous, saturday prime-time slot. some movie i had never heard of before called "raptor." i was pretty excited. the movie begins with some teens driving around in a jeep, when they get stalked and killed by a velociraptor. i was like, "hmmm, that's odd, that looks almost exactly like a scene in "carnosaur," except it was in the middle of that movie." then i sat through some really bad acting and then some guy was suckered into walking into an underground research laboratory where he got eaten by a ferocious t-rex. now i'm like, "wait a second, that was also a scene in "carnosaur." then, after i saw some scenes blatantly ripped off from "carnosaur 2", i figured out just what the hell was going on. so basically, roger corman & co. ripped off scenes from the "carnosaur" trilogy to use as the action scenes, weaved in a basic "dinosaur-runs-amok" plot, and tried to pass it off as an original movie. shameful. i don't know who i'm more angry at, roger corman or scifi channel for trying to pass this off as worthy of the prime-time slot. the only reason why this was worth watching to its conclusion was to pick out the actors/actresses who looked like their counterparts in the "carnosaur" trilogy and guess which scenes would be lifted next. as much as it pains me, being a dinosaur lover, i have no choice but to give this the lowest possible rating because i feel completely ripped off.

we all know that the world is full of dodgy, rip-off horror films. some of these can be fun to watch, due to their stupidity, awful effects and iffy dialogue. but raptor, which could have been in the same league as the equally pointless carnosaur series, does not even attempt to have any enjoyment in it. its so poorly done, it is really unbearable, even if your just watching it with the intentions of having a no-brain day at home. where do we start? well... the sets are pretty drab. my old drama group created more realistic stages. the genetics labs look like they are from a university, and it looks equally unbelievable on the outside (even for cover-up, why would you place yourself near civilisation where people can easily hear the dinosaur roars), whilst the doctors ward just doesn't look believable at all. next up in the complaints list is the creature effects; well, what can i say? absolutely pitiful. also, i think it's worth mentioning, the woman's tits should be mentioned as an effect. both of the main female characters have so obviously had boob-jobs, and it brings the characters down, being one female is a respected member of police, whilst the other is the sweet, "innocent" daughter of the towns sheriff. the acting, though, is by far the worst tragedy. eric roberts can be excused for at least trying a bit to give his role something. thats where it ends. corbin benson should have killed his costume designer for making his lacklustre performance look even more pathetic, whilst the female lead looks so bored (though, with this film you could let her off). the other character i'll point out is the daughter, who lets her tits do all the acting in the "raunchy" sex scene (ten minutes of endless re-run shots of her bouncing on top of some bloke).all in all, and summed up as one. don't bother, just don't.

i bought a dvd collection (9 movies for 10 euros) where this one was included. it turned out to be the "uncut version" whatever that means. beside the low average quality and short scenes there was one thing that was really strange - the soft sex scene. it started with a close up of 2 bigger breasts. after around 2 minutes i had an expression on my face which fitted the term "boooooooooooooring!" quite perfectly. 7.5 minutes of not even bouncing concrete like tits (at this point the term breasts is a bad choice) is far beyond from entertainment.the rest of the movie was more like "people aren't /that/ stupid, are they?" lucky me, the dvd was scratched and i got my money back.

the defining scene to this movie is when the fat guy quits,but the evil doctor just gives him one more duty,check on the dinosaurs.keep in mind that he no longer has this job and so is absolutely not getting paid for this.also keep in mind it's a goddamn dinosaur and the doctor he's supposed to trust is evil and doesn't like him.but he's still like,yeah okay.that just defined the stupidity in this movie.one melissa brasselle proves that seriously anyone can bolt on some breasts and be in movies.i can go ride a mountain-bike between them,but hey aside from that the people of paraguay are very nice.eric roberts gives his absolute worst performance so far,there's no adjective to describe how bored he is throughout.corbin bernsen saves what there is to save and you start rooting for him,but they have to stick to the formula of course.and i wonder how much your life sucks when you play like,one of the army guys in this one?how low can your acting career go?the special effects are so embarrassingly bad you expect a sign saying "studio 3" to get into the frame.it's not even honest pulp,it's all taken from "carnosaur",which even sucked all by itself.and then i wonder why just anyone is allowed to make a movie.

the biggest and most disconcerting things of the raptor movie was ending for the tyransaurus is identical to carnosaur except kid in the loader was a bit better acted and action then the adult. the similarities to the carnosaur movies was rather poor choice in plot line. the only thing that approached good was the beginning with the kids in the jeep. then the plot went down hill from there. would have been nice if a different plot had been devised, rather then cloning the earlier movies. the raptor movie should have taken lesson from jurasic park series in various plots. the only movie that has come close to a good dinosaur movie most recently is aztec rex. the repeated scenes as if taken from the carnosaur movies leaves a person thinking of those movies.

first of all, i would like to clarify that i consider this one of the funniest films i have ever seen. i have watched it almost 10 times just because i've wished to spread the deliciously tasteless innards of this film to other unsuspecting victims. it has the captivating essence of a hand-held camera recording of a distant nephew's seventh birthday. it has all the writing of a wwe match. and most of all, it has the consistency of a face scraped along a sidewalk. this movie is a masterpiece.the film begins with an almost instantaneous mutilation of three, drunken teens in the desert. this scene convinced me that i was onto something big when i picked this film from the dvd rack (being drawn to the box because of the graphic of a velociraptor yelling the word "raptor" on the front of it). the scene contains such treasures as tomato sauce, spaghetti intestines, vain attempts at humour and rubbery dinosaur puppets that repeat throughout the course of the movie. this movie is a masterpiece.the film contains erratic backdrops and prop use that causes one's mind to melt at the thought that someone could just have so little shame when it comes to creating a film. an example is when a truck, in the middle of the night, is parked beside a cliff wall. the very next day, they find it in an open grassy area. the driver couldn't have driven it there since he had his face bitten off by an unnamed bipedal carnivore (i will explain why it's unnamed in a second). so, my only guess is that either the velociraptor drove it, the livestock the driver was transporting did it, or jim wynorski doesn't think very highly of his viewers. hell, in one part they expect me to believe that they are walking down a main street at night when the road doesn't have gutters, the fire hydrant is precariously placed next to a phone booth, and there's only a single street light. yet, still, i feel compelled to watch and re-watch this film, just so i can find more things that will make me giggle the next time i watch it. this film is a masterpiece.the directing on this film is horrific. long extended pauses. strange cuts to characters that weren't even in the general vicinity of the conversation. people discussing things casually while facing the camera (and in turn, making them face the wall). they can't even give the dinosaur a coherent species, flipping between calling it a baby dinosaur and using a rubber velociraptor puppet (distinguished by the intensely long, fat, disproportionate claw). this film is a masterpiece.the editing is prominent on this film. this is not a good thing. i am well aware that the film is a collection of scenes from other films, masterfully crafted into a single piece of crap, but there has to be a limit! sub plots end as abruptly as they began. explanations for the sudden disappearance of characters not being limited to, well, not being explained at all! and an ending that felt like driving a muscle car into a brick wall without a seat belt. you just never know what is going to happen because the film doesn't follow a coherent structure. this film is a masterpiece.now, i'm going to just have to mention a single scene (the greatest one) that occurs near the end. this is a spoiler, but not really. the final scene contains a showdown between tyrannosaurus rex and sheriff tanner. it is like the showdown between sigourney weaver and the alien queen in aliens, except without all the emotional power/budget/epic battling. it pretty consists of tanner ramming the dinosaur with a piece of construction machinery. a white bobcat. in a space of several minutes, through a series of sneakily slipped in cuts, the director manages to turn that white bobcat into a yellow forklift/crane looking piece of machinery. now, as i said, i know that this film is made from scenes from other films, but what two films warrant a showdown with a t-rex in a construction vehicle? this film is a masterpiece.this film gets a 1/10 for quality of film making, but a 10/10 for how much it makes me laugh and enjoy myself.

this movie is an abortive, stillborn attempt to stitch together several bad movies and make some sort of extra-bad movie. it fails at even this, since there's way too much "plot", and not nearly enough goofy puppets and ridiculous gore. seriously, the puppets are sweet, and the guys in suits crack me up pretty good. the performances are c-grade at best and lame throughout, with special props to the spec-ops guy who spoke some sort of bizarre east coast/venusian dialect that was almost impossible to decipher. not that you really care what he says, as only the curse words are distinct. cinematographically, it's non-offensive, pretty much what you'd expect from low-rent straight-to-video offal (just like the script). the fact that new concorde used footage from the "carnosaur" films is offensive, and quite confusing. for shame, new concorde. for shame. "carnosaur" is one of my favorite terrible movies, and they somehow screwed it up and made it nigh unwatchable. see the "carnosaur" films if you want to see shoestring dinosaur mayhem.i give it one star because i am so fond of the movies it steals from, and also because the scale doesn't have a zero.

oy vey... jurrasic park got corman-ized. as usual the plot is wafer thin, from 1 foot tall dinosaurs that weigh 150 pounds and leave tracks bigger than they are, to inexplicable science which uses lasers to keep the dinosaurs in check and poultry trucks which have chickens loose in cages large enough for big dogs (i've seen chicken trucks they are all in cages the size of shoe boxes). and all that is in the first 15 minutes of this disaster of a film. all the male actors are imbeciles (thinking a grizzly might be loose in the desert, constantly dropping items to give the raptor an easy kill) and the female actors all look like they just came from a modeling shoot for fredrick's of hollywood. the raptor itself is the worst thing since the hobgoblins (from the movie of the same name), it looks like they had a hand puppet version and a plastic model for the "motion" shots. if you want a good movie to sit around and heckle mst3k style, this is gold. if you want competent film making and good acting... don't watch a roger corman film. acting gets a 4 out 10, some of the players upon this stage did try. story gets a 2 out of 10, it reads like a drunken storytelling session gone bad. special effects gets a 2 out of 10, i've seen worse, but not many.

**********spoiler alert***************if you happen to like jurassic park 1, 2, or 3:if you happen to appreciate really bad movies for their sheer entertainment value if not for their quality (case in point-john carpenter's dark star-highly recommended)if you happen to like movies about dinosaurs in general-then stay away from this cinematic crapsterpiece!the shameless use of stock footage from carnosaur 1 & 2 make up most of this miserable attempt at a dino/slasher flick- take the scene, for instance, where the security guard meets his doom at the jaws of the alpha t-rex. for some reason, he drops about 50 pounds and appears 10 years younger. why is that? simply because this scene was lifted directly from carnosaur, which was a crummy flick to begin with.the ending was a carbon copy of carnosaur 2, for those unfortunate enough to have sat through that straight-to-video loser. again, we see mr. rex do battle against a bulldozer-which alternates as a forklift truck-through the miracle of -ta-daa!- stock footage from the aforementioned carnosaur 1 & 2. of course, the ending is exactly the same-the beast falls to his death just as the complex goes up in flames.a real insult to anyone's intelligence.but it's still better than watching the rosie o' donnel show.rating: 1/2* out of *****

the worst film ever, with characters from carnosaur 1-3 inserted merely to fall to the same demise that they had in the first film, so that footage and special effects could be reused.stay away from this debacle.corman is ruining his legacy. he made and produced some amazing films - but that era ended with carnosaur being his last "creative in its badness" film.

on the bright side, it ended. that's the only thing this movie has going for it, of course.this is the worst movie i have ever seen, and i've seen some bad ones. this movie is actually so horrible, i went and changed my rating for children of the living dead to a 2 just for not being raptor.official one-liner rating: "come with me to another movie if you want to live."

this movie is sad. according to my fellow imdb users, (*spoiler*) raptor uses stock footage from the carnotaur films. well, since i have not seen the carnotaur movies, i cannot say. but, i do notice some pretty bad editing and even worse acting. this movie is one big steaming pile of s***. it makes absolutely no sense. here is this thing that calls itself a plot: mad scientist re-creates raptors. raptors kill people. sheriff investigates. *spoiler* (although i don't know what it is that i'm spoiling) sheriff catches on to mad doctor's plans. army guys are sent in and raptors start killing army guys. raptors. yeah, right. i could make a clay figure that looks more real. the fx are the cheapest ever used in a movie. there is a lot of gore. cheap gore. it doesn't even look real. i will agree with another person who rated this movie that the only thing this movie has going for it is the fact that it ends. there are about two seconds of originality in this film. and that only comes from when the sheriff is talking to some tax agent on the phone about his electric bill or something. this idea has been used in about 100,000 other movies with 100,000 different names. overall, i'm gonna give raptor 1/5 just because it ended.

uwe boll slips back in his film-making skills once again to offer up a scifi horror tale of mercenaries and reporters taking on super soldiers on a remote island. an okay cast headed by the excellent udo keir is cast adrift by boll who makes the worst of script that should have worked. the mad scientist being investigated by a reporter has been done to death but this script is amusing enough that the plot should have worked, additionally the effects and super soldier design with their dead lifeless eyes have some degree of creepiness, however boll somehow manages to film everything in an off handed way. its as if he couldn't be bothered to actually figure out what would work and instead rattled off stock camera placements and walked away. additionally the assembly of scenes has no spark or life, i'm guessing that boll only shot one or two takes and just used what he had. it really stinks. clearly boll is in one of his periodic retrograde films where anything he's ever learned about film gets flushed. the last film he made that was this bad was seed a serial killer movie that is one of the worst films i've ever seen. this isn't that bad, but it is close simply because it should have been better. then again udo keir is good enough that he does make watching his scenes worth the effort and make this a an almost so bad its good film. i'd take a pass unless it's late at night and you're catching it on cable.

i don't really mind the creative ideas interjected in these movies, but seriously. there isn't one coherent part of the game in this movie. that seems to be the trend, buy the rights and then just make a movie that has zero to do with what the fans want. this butchering is almost entertaining because you know you are getting away with hiding behind a lack of skill, and control of money (not yours) that allows you to do this. play a game, or hire someone to, and please make a real movie, or stand in the boxing ring and have your butt handed to you as you so claim won't happen.wow, 9 lines of text and i was done. had to add blah to bug you, sorry

i am deeply disturbed by some posts i am reading on the message boards for this movie, people saying it is actually a good movie! just because this movie is uwe boll's best to date does not make it a good movie at all, no way in hell! far cry is a clichéd mess full of bad acting, poor direction, and an uninspired story with a shoddy script. this is boll's first pure action movie, and news flash people, action movies aren't too hard to make because for a basic action flick all you need is explosions and gun battles scattered around a flimsy plot, and hey, mr. boll succeeds in doing that. house of the dead, alone in the dark, and bloodrayne, all horror games adapted into movies by boll are far worse than this (they have no redeeming qualities). far cry boasts two things which make it his best yet: two good leads and a couple of well-done action sequences. til schweiger is quite good as jack carver, and emmanuelle vaugier is a strong female lead. the usually great udo kier is passable as the clichéd villain and the supporting cast are pretty damn bad. towards the end of the film there is a surprisingly tense chase sequence which came as a shock considering boll was behind the camera.unfortunately the rest of the movie has an incredibly cheap feel to it, with bad cgi, lame one-liners and clichés around every corner. oh, and the worst lead up to a sex scene i think i have ever scene. not only have the two only known each other for six hours, but all it takes is for him to say he kept warm while in the army by spooning his fellow soldiers. he already got her to take his clothes off by merely telling her to. then he took his off and climbed into bed because he was afraid of hypothermia.anyway, to summarise, this is a bad movie. it is mindless action movie that can kill 80 minutes if you are totally bored. one could probably do worse than popping this in and watching it, but i'd personally say watch a classic action film like die hard or predator and stay away from this derivative mess.1½/5

there is only one reason this movie is watchable. till schweiger. he is such a good actor the movie isn't completely terrible. uwe boll please take up another career. the special effects and action are acceptable. all other aspects were very disappointing. all i can say is that kevin smith (an evening with...) talked about tim burton not ever reading the batman comics and it showed. uwe boll must not have ever played the video games that he keeps making movies about. if you two ever want to know how it is done go see andrzej bartkowiak. doom was one of the best video games to film adaptations ever. some people may disagree, but if you watch the movie you can see that the guys at id had a lot to do with doom. it doesn't seem like anyone at ubisoft was even near this production.

one of bolls better attempts. just shows that if you do something long enough you have to improve just by chance. it is still not good but it is at least watchable which is an improvement over the bloodrayne. the main difference between bloodrayne and farcry really is that the story from farcry wasn't the games strong point whereas bloodrayne had a strong story and thus boll had more chance to mess it up.the action in this movie is actually fairly good. occasionally a touch overdone but in a good way and worth a watch just for that.acting wise it was pretty decent. most of the actors are pretty good but you can tell they aren't taking it seriously based on comparisons with other performances. but the lighter mood this gives to the film actually helps.while i think sticking a little bit closer to the story of the game might have made for a slightly better film the changes made are pretty practical and not big enough to make a difference. especially given the plot of the game was hardly oscar winning just a vehicle for fps carnage. would have liked it set in the jungle as that was a pretty integral part of the game but canada doesn't have a great deal of jungle and it is at least set in a kind of rainforest.why boll feels the need to change already professionally scripted and directed game plots i don't know but he does. and until he starts letting the source material speak through his adaptations will always be lacking. watch the film for a laugh its good for that and maybe for watching during a party as drinking party fodder.

mr. "uwe fail" strikes again, transformed a classic game in a cheap piece of crap. poor acting; poor directing; awful adaptation; i mean, far-cry game was awesome, its like a true fps game, cool weapons and lots lots lots of "point and shoot". in the movie we had nothing compared to the game.. well we had some of the "point and shoot" thing but... i don't know how to explain, but if you ever watched another "uwe fail" movie you will understand. if you don't believe me, go to the website "petition online" and do a check for one named "stop uwe bowl".that movie made my eyes bleed, someone must stop him for once.don't waste your time.

i was one "chosen" to see this movie in a sneak preview.first you should know that this film is based on the video game "far cry", a for its time really good game (2004). second you should know that the regisseur of this flick is the great uwe boll. this is a man, who takes video games (dungeon siege, bloodrayne, postal, etc.) and makes movies out of them (very horrible ones....).i still remember when i saw boll's "the king's swords: a dungeon siege tail". there were so horrible mistakes in this film (like 3 scenes playing at the same time, 2 at day-time, and one somehow at night.....)so lets come to "far cry". if you expect cool action, forget it. really cheap tricks and a plastic helicopter are far away from real action. if you expect a cool story, forget it. orientating by the not-so-bad story of the game, this movie is a laugh. the actors' playing makes the movie in a lot of moments funny, but in a no-good way.i had the chance to see this movie for free. so do not do the mistake and pay for this trash. its one of my favorised flicks for the bottom 100.!!!!

glenn ford, a new york boy who has been saving his cash, thumbs and hobos his way to the arizona ranch he has bought, where he hopes to find heaven with a barbed wire fence.a film with a dalton trumbo script and story, directed by villain extraordinaire ricardo cortez, and starring the frequently twitchy glenn ford and the restless richard conte just shouldn't be so bloody nice. though the system -- mostly seen as mean cops and railroad bulls and real estate con men -- is as awful as one might expect from the leftish mr. trumbo, every single proletarian is just so sweet and nice and salt of the earth that one feels nausea. it doesn't help that the heroine -- a sweet blonde thing who is an illegal alien refugee fleeing franco's spain -- is annoying for reasons of both scripting and acting.so why watch? richard conte, in his first role, already has his persona and a pretty good part. and there are some moments of 30s leftist camp that are pretty astonishing. (did dalton absolutely have to set a major portion of the movie in the russian worker's mission? all that was missing was a portrait of a beaming joe stalin!) also, this is glenn ford's first substantive role (though his performance isn't good).why not watch? essentially, the movie offers an unconvincing vision, is wedded to a political viewpoint that is risible, and the two leads have made much better movies. also, the strengths of dalton trumbo as a screenwriter are nowhere in evidence. instead, we get a film that the coen brothers barton fink could have written in a flash (and avoided that hellish bout with writer's block).

a total and utter travesty of a movie.'dark power'is the kind of film even troma would be embarrassed to release.the script,direction,acting and action sequence's are so dire as to be almost painful to watch and one cant help thinking that it's mere 75 minute running time could have been better spent. the above reviewer must be related to the director as that's the only reason i can see for his/her appraisal of this rubbish,some might call it b-movie fun or 'so bad it's good' just to excuse there enjoyment of it,but when the lead actor ( and most experienced cast member) cant deliver his lines convincingly you know you've got a very,very bad movie.avoid at all costs.

when a group of dumb kids (including an unlikable. racist bitch) stay at an old house, it awakens four murderous toltec spirits. can lash la rue save the day? will you be able to watch until the end due to the horrible comedy on display."the dark power" is the kind of really bad horror/comedy hybrid troma used to release regularly. thing is, they didn't. release this. that doesn't excuse the whole thing, as it has a dreadful synthesizer score (including bad attempts at native american music and even worse "comedy" music), bad make up effects (basically halloween masks), and atrocious acting (ok, the fat guy was alright, though everyone else is terrible, and la rue, a western movie vet, seems embarrassed to be there-not that i blame him really.)the worst thing though, is the comedy aspects. sure, dumb teens is one thing, but when the movie keeps talking about the toltec spirits as if they are the ultimate evil, only for them to turn out to be horribly annoying, bumbling fools, all hope is dashed. combining horror and comedy takes at least some skill. there is no skill on display here, as it all is just stupid, and not "so dumb it's fun" either. i mean "smoking pot and listening to bad punk rock aren't i dumb" dumb.not even a decent ripped off face and a chick in little clothing can save this disaster. terrible movie, and not even worth a rental.

don't bother to check for logic. there is none. but on the other hand, there are many really great movies that totally lack logic, so why bother?i both like and dislike this film. i like it because the action sequences in the air are really great, you get to see a lot of dogfighting. i also like the f-16, which is a very cool plane.but there are just too many goofs to make me really enjoy it. i guess it's not fair to wish for some sort of continuity, as it is hard to make a really good fighter film - but i also think there should be some sense of reason.and i have a question: do they fly from california to the middle east in f-16s without air refueling? i'd like to see that happening.

i have rarely laughed so hard at a movie. notice that i laughed at iron eagle, not with it, because this is probably the stupidest film i have ever seen (with the obvious exception of sci-fi monstrosity cybertracker). you should also remember that this film is not a comedy!even overlooking the preposterous plot (the idea that a 16-year-old could walk into a us air force base, steal an f-16, fly to the middle east and kill about a thousand people without anyone noticing is beyond belief), the film is full of ridiculous action scenes that make little or no sense. for example, at various points, doug masters uses a machine-gun on his plane to shoot a steel girder, a control tower, and a tent. all of these things explode in a massive fireball. why? the enemy aircraft also explode in a strange way reminiscent of a paper aeroplane being blown up with a firework.on the plus side, i did actually enjoy this film. admittedly not in the way the makers probably wanted it to be enjoyed, but all the same i laughed at it and later bought the dvd. it's also improved by the awesome presence of david suchet as the evil terrorist leader (maybe you'll recall him as mustachioed belgian detective poirot?) overall, then, the film is a laugh and a light-hearted alternative to more serious fighter-plane movies like top gun. even if it is just as subtly homo-erotic (check out the man-hug between doug and chappy. something's going on between 'em!)

this movie is the proverbial 80s flick that shows the viewer that as long as he or she tries at something, they can be better than the pros. the main character, doug, showed off his skills in flying a cessna aircraft, which somehow equated to being fully capable of flying a jet aircraft and being able to kill people. we all would like to have a few million dollars to play with... maybe make a good investment, donate, buy a few things, but the directors of this movie decided to make iron eagle... not once... not twice... not even three times; yes, four times. the thing to look most forward to are the multitude 'hollywood endings' in this movie. just when you think the movie is going to end after a cheesy end sequence, there's another cheesy end sequence. then another. definitely a movie one must watch to believe... and maybe own just to remind oneself of how awesome the 80s must have been.

it's hard to believe that a movie this bad wasn't produced once, but four times! most movies require a certain `suspension of reality' to enjoy, but this one takes it just too far. the basic scenario is an air force pilot who is shot down over a `middle eastern' country. the us government drags its feet in recovering him, leading the pilot's son (doug masters) to attempt a rescue mission.the problem i have with the movie is that it depicts the us air force as one colossal joke. in the movie you'll find that doug and his friends on the air base manage to secure two f-16's, all the munitions, the fuel, the intel for the mission, and so on. security on this base seems to be a joke. nobody seems to have a problem that a sixteen-year-old kid is fully qualified to pilot an f-16!if that wasn't enough, you would think the producers would at least attempt to get the munitions right, since people like to see things `blow up'. not so! several times in the movie, doug fires off aim-9 missiles on ground targets. aim stands for `air intercept missile', meaning a weapon used to strike targets in the air. he also fires off 15-20 missiles, where the maximum an f-16 can hold is 6 aim-9's. the movie also lacks continuity. you'll see the aircraft configured with one set of munitions, and in the next scene, it has a totally different munitions package. also, 20mm doesn't just completely destroy anything it touches! an f-16 will hold 500 rounds of 20mm, and it's mostly used for self-defense.i could go on forever with plot holes, flaws, and outright wrong information from the movie, but i won't bore you. if you're in the mood to see a good air force movie, your choices are rather slim. most military movies deal either with the army, navy or marines. until hollywood can come up with an air force movie on the lines of `saving private ryan' or `a few good men', we'll be forced to watch movies like the `iron eagle' series.

as a retired usaf msg (aircraft maint. spec), this has got to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen. the fact that a teenager could ever get on the flight-line, much less get into an f-16 is ludicrous. the military spends millions on each pilot to make them the best in the world and this movie makes the air force and all its members seem stupid at best. yes, i know it is only a movie but it conveys a message to the younger folks that we are all idiots, and believe me, we are not. the logistics involved in setting up any type of mission are highly involved, even in the eighties, military computers were too secure to hack by any teenager, and the other flaws in this movie make peter pan more believable. sorry, to me, this movie has no entertainment value at all.

i wrote spoiler alert, but there's not really much that can be spoiled. it's like spoiling rotten meat. this movie is probably the worst i've ever seen. not because of the actors or the special effects, but because of the sheer number of mistakes, both factual and physical. first of all, the migs aren't actually migs at all. they're mirages, and they're french. and how the heck can doug's dad withstand the maneuvers his son makes to fight off the "migs" without a g-suit? and why would chappy try to board his plane without a g-suit? and how could doug defeat the enemy pilot ace with such ease? anyway, i did not like this movie. and the worst part is that it has 3 sequels, the latest one from as late as 1995. now that's scary.

i loved this movie 10 years ago when i was about 16 years old. my biggest mistake was to watch it again, 10 years later. it's not the worst "i-wanna-be-a-pilot" movies ever, but it has so many flaws in it that you can hardly overlook them.queen's "one vision" (along with the rest of the soundtrack) makes this film better than the average patriotic nonsense you usually get to see ;)[****------]

i was pleasantly surprised with this one. it's actually quite interesting and engaging. the cast is strong, even dan cortese. brooke shields has come into her own as an actress. black and white must have really set her free, 'cause i have never seen her in this much command playing a conventional character. if marketed right, could be a medium-size hit.

brooke shields -- in a departure from her "suddenly susan" duties -- plays a bitter divorcee who embroils three girlfriends in a "girls only" weekend in palm springs. the problem: brooke is "unattached" and on the prowl, while her friends are all involved. hence the title implications and emotional backlash their "amoral" weekend causes.despite a few laughs generated by dan cortese ("victoria's closet") and mtv "relationship authorities" adam corolla and dr. drew pinsky, this is somber stuff for women only. d.b. sweeney, virginia madsen and jon polito co-star.

it's amazing that such a cliche-ridden yuppie angst film actually got made in the first place. the characters are so weak, and the acting so uninspired, that it's impossible to care about any of them-- especially brooke shields. the temptation to fast forward through the slow parts is almost irresistible. if you like this genre, you'd be better off renting "singles," or "bodies, rest & motion."

i like to think of myself as a bad movie connoisseur. i like to think that the films most people label as the worst of all time i can easily withstand.but...there are exceptions. i can only recall three movies i have had the misfortune to see that i have repeatedly used the fast-forward button for large chunks of the story. those movies are the mighty gorga, night of the seagulls, and this little crap, deep blood.in the world of jaws ripoffs, this falls off the scale. deep blood doesn't have the realistic storyline of the original crocodile, nor the incredible effects of the sea serpent, nor the commentary of tintorera. no, instead we are treated to a handful of teens from any random failed '80s public access sitcom battling bullies and the local sheriff.shark attacks are realized by quick cuts of documentary footage with actors thrashing about in the water, occasionally with a bit of what appears to be orange-ish paint thrown into the water. not a minute of original shark footage exists in this celluloid waste dump.normally, i, or somebody like me, would read a dismal review like this one and say "cool, i gotta find a copy of this!" that's the same thought i had when i read another viewer's review on this very site. how wrong i was.so...from one bad movie fan to another...let this collect dust on the shelf...grab up from the depths or the great alligator instead to satisfy your need for something evil lurking in the water.

zzzzzzzzzzzz. this one came directly from the "jaws" cookie-cutter mold, with some other bizarre cliches thrown in for good measure. i was interested in seeing this after finding a still from it in a book about italian horror films, and wow...i guess i got what i deserved!very slow-moving and talky, much of this killer shark movie takes place on land, which isn't really that surprising. it seems like the only method they had of showing a shark is through shots of a shark in an aquarium. the shark is never in the same frame as any of the actors, and that's too bad...most of the characters are so annoying that you actually wish they would get eaten.the "plot" concerns a group of four kids who meet up with a mysterious indian on the beach one day while roasting weenies. the indian, for some reason, gives them an ancient artifact that will allow them to track an ancient evil that assumed the form of a monster shark to attack their tribe...supposedly because they were too good at fishing the ocean and the ocean god was worried they would take all the fish. or something like that.it's a good thing too, because wouldn't ya know it...years later, a monster shark appears and starts gobbling up people in the sleepy seaside community. when one of the four guys are eaten by the shark, the remaining three are determined to kill the thing...especially since (big shocker here) the authorities have killed a shark and they think the threat is over. yawn.the obligatory death scenes are unbelievably tedious, and you can see them coming a mile away (my favorite was the girl who has a fight with her boyfriend while they're sitting in a van, then jumps out and says "i'm going for a swim," immediately to be gobbled up by the waiting shark). they had a lot of nerve calling this film "deep blood" since you hardly see any, just cloudy water. the actors handle their cliched roles like they're all thumbs, and there is even a hilarious subplot involving a greasy rocker-type bad boy who threatens our goody-goody heroes, then turns good in the end to help kill the shark.it took me a really long time to find this film, it is rather obscure, so i don't think there's any danger of too many people wasting their time on this. however, if you should be lured into it...don't say you weren't warned!

this is the worst italian movie ever, quite possibly the worst movie of all time! joe d'amato is of course no cinematic genius but many of his movies are interesting and watchable. unfortunatly this is not one of them. its cheesy and boring....waaaaay boring. if you want a movie to mst3k, get troll 2, if you want a movie to put someone into a coma, get deep blood!

this movie is crappy beyond any limits. it's incredible - a very bad ripoff from jaws and other (better) shark movies. a really bad one - everything is really pathetic. the story is purest crap, actors are bad, effects very cheap, no creativity whatsoever. it looks like some really debilitated children took jaws script and arranged it randomly, then its parents took their 8 mm camera and shot the movie with their neighbors. the music is really inappropriate, just some "elevator" music, bland and overly optimistic when nothing happens, then slightly less optimistic when shark is around or when children gets depressed (again listens to very loud elevator music). carlo maria (the author) should be so ashamed he should ask for his name to be erased from the titles!! the movie acts as perfect demonstration how crappy music will destroy ***any*** scene which is supposed to be thrilling. there is one major difference to jaws though: in the beginning of jaws there are comments about stupid people who try to kill shark with dynamite. well, there is an attempt to kill a shark with dynamite. when this does not work, guys take an ***big load*** of dynamite and spent like 1/4 of movie by placing explosives in some sunken ship. this is really original way to catch the fish i have to admit! they use so much dynamite like they would try to kill a battleship (i would guess bismarck class of battleship) or to dig another panama channel. this is just incredible. i'm glad they did not try to use napalm-flamethrower or tactical nuclear strike to eliminate this bad, bad approximately 2 m shark. well, there is mystic disappearing native indian (who looks like german pensioner) too in this mess. this is not a movie, this is a warning example how bad the movies may be! as a warning it is useful. but the public should be protected from this crap. most of italian movies is bad, but this... this is really exceptional in the worst sense of the word.

the jaws rip off is the trashiest of the all the italian 'genres', and director joe d'amato is second only to the great jess franco in the trash film production stakes. put the two together and what do you get? a gigantic piece of trash, of course. unfortunately it's not trash in the good sense of the word either, as deep blood delivers more in boredom than it does in hilarity. to the film's credit, it does actually attempt something bordering on a plot; but to take said credit away from the film - the plot is rubbish. it has something to do with a group of friends taking of an oath (of friendship) and then some indian curse that manifests itself into a shark. or at least i think that's what was going on. anyway, the majority of the film is padded out with boring dialogue and 'drama', and the shark itself - which lets not forget, is the only thing we really want to see - finds itself in merely a cameo role. or not even that since most the shark is actually stock footage! despite being a trash genre, there are actually a lot of fun jaws rip-offs; but with this one, joe d'amato makes it clear that he couldn't be bothered to even try, and the result is what must be the worst italian shark movie of all time. avoid this dross.

parrots? parrots? i have been around this old earth longer than most and have seen nearly all the westerns that have have produced. old west history is my passion. comanche moon is one of the most poorly produced, directed and acted stories i have ever seen. there was very little historical accuracy but then, it is obvious you were operating on a shoestring budget whichplayed a distinct roll in this insult to intelligence. i am happy that i tivo'd this show. it was bad enough having to sit and watch the movie plus put up with the inane commercials. once again, there was not one actor that came anywhere near convincing. i kept hoping it would improve as the three days progressed. wrong! i'm ashamed to say i wasted 4 1/2 hours of what precious little time i have left.

okay, so i forgot to watch and only caught the last episode, thinking it was the first or second. honestly, i thought cm would have at least one more installment to resolve plot points. the rangers are left stranded on the plains ("we'll have to eat the horses"), for one thing. little newt is bereft, for another. what a downer ending! but my biggest complaint, esp. if this was the finale, is that the episode had no suspense, no big climax, no dramatic confrontations. even the last fight between blue duck and buffalo hump was badly staged. the whole episode had terrible pacing, which is what drives a western. steve zahn was watchable, karl urban (a ringer for johnny knoxville) played call like a man with a terminal case of lockjaw. all glowering looks and jingling spurs and jutting chin. and what's with the rangers? they talked big, about cleaning up texas, then milled around aimlessly in the middle of town, getting drunk. and how nice of hal holbrook to loan val kilmer his mark twain wig and stache! the set of austin was like the fake rock ridge from blazing saddles, all facade. i admit i was drawn into the plot, but that's mainly cause there were many things i didn't quite get, thanks to coming in late in story. if i'd watched from the beginning, i might not have gotten to episode three. now i have to go watch silverado to cleanse my palette.

please do not waste six hours of your life watching this as i did. the fact that i did is not a very good reflection on me. the only redeeming acting job in this clunker was by wes studi. how a 'prequel' with similar roots can not even be in the same universe as lonesome dove is beyond me!! it was a disjointed, rambling, incoherent story. plot lines were not developed, action scenes were almost laughable and the big ending (disappointment) was a fitting ending to this mini-series. val kilmer who i have thought as a reputable actor played one of the strangest roles that i have ever seen him in. his final scene in the show had to have been a filler by the director. i have been reading these reviews for years and this show prompted me to sign up!!!

i just watched lonesome dove, return to lonesome dove, streets of laredo and dead man's walk. all excellent. this sorry hunk of junk is cheaply done and poorly acted.in the previous series, captain call and gus mccrae come off as tough respectable cowboys. despite the fact that caption call is played by a different actor every time each one quickly won me over. in dead man's walk the boys are believable as the younger versions of the experienced texas rangers. in comanche moon they are just a couple of chubby rednecks. i had to stop watching.i suspect many of the glowing reviews for this show were written by the people who made this stinking pile. it's a sorry end to an otherwise great franchise.

the photography is good, the costumes are good, but the editing is bad. the various scenes are cut, or stopped at the wrong times, and the conversations are s-l-o-w and tedious. this slowness continues the entire show. it is a very tedious show to watch. . . . i believe that more scenes should have been added, but that would make it a longer show. it is very slow-moving. the writers should have made it just a 1-night show, and not prolong our agony night after night. there is nothing else on, otherwise i'd change the channel (the first night). i feel bad for the indians of the time, and am angry at the white-men for what they did to the indians, but thats our history.

i will give it a second chance but was very disappointed in the first one. it wouldn't hold a candle to the other series. it has a lot of meaningless dialog that doesn't add to the storyline at all. i agree with the others that it doesn't seem to develop a story that is interesting. it is slow and plodding and i only know what the comanches are planning to do. maybe it will all tie together in the second installment but i am going to have to force myself to watch it and find out. i am of apache heritage from the texas/new mexico area but i don't recognize much of what is happening. maybe i am just ignorant of the facts but this isn't doing much to educate me.

agustus and call really did nothing? why are they hero's they did nothing other then get to places after the bad guys where dead. what was the point of this show? i was very very disappointed. i expected more action, more story, and to see the birth of heros and great deeds. instead i saw very little, it seemed like agustus and call where just side story's for the great indian chief. i'm not even sure that the history is even very close. they did very little to show why the texans and comanche fought against each other.the only good part about this movie was zhan who played gus very very well and is a great actor. a lot of good story that could have been gone to waste. it was sad and i wish that i had not watched it.

i must have missed a part of this movie... i found myself asking who is this? and, when did that happen? it seemed to jump around but i kept watching for fear i was missing something and it would all be explained to me. i loved lonesome dove but this movie made no sense to me at all. i did love all the actors but what happened to the rest of the movie? it made me go "what"? at the beginning of each part..as far as the scenery - i thought it was fine..it made me feel though like i was leafing through a book and leaving pages out.. the ending had me a little confused too although i imagine the boy was waiting for his father and was meant to leave you wondering if his father would finally come home to his son and be a father since his mother was now gone..i would like to read the book just to see what i missed in the movie..i don't expect this one to win any awards.

i'm not sure this review contains spoilers, but i'm playing it safe by indicating there might be. regardless, it's unlikely anyone will watch this film who isn't familiar with the book.there's an old wisecrack about laboring mightily and bringing forth a mouse. "comanche moon" is such a mouse.the novel focuses more on the indians than the americans. in adapting it for tv, mcmurtry and osanna rightly reasoned that the audience would be more interested in the whites than the reds. unfortunately, there's little in the novel that we don't already know about gus, woodrow, and their friends. so the movie gives us mostly a portentous prehash of what will occur in "lonesome dove". the indians -- who have their own story to tell -- are largely relegated to the background -- so much so that someone who hasn't read the novel will rightly wonder why it's titled "comanche moon".the novel has no overall story line, or much of a "point". this could have been fixed in the movie, by more strongly drawing the contrast between the indians losing their lands and way of life to the encroaching americans, who bring "civilzation". this opportunity was missed.unlike "lonesome dove", "comanche moon" has few extended scenes that develop character or relationships -- at least among the americans. the extended scenes with the indians have been largely removed or shortened. and for a (net) four-hour film, it is remarkably episodic and choppy. one gets the feeling the script was originally longer, and cut to reduce the production costs.the screenplay comprises mostly clichéd dialog, aphorisms, and platitudes. coming from the author of "the last picture show", it's a startlingly bad script. mcmurtry and osanna had the opportunity to fix problems with the story and characterizations, but did not.some of the best dialog from the novel is missing or altered, for no obvious reason. for example, clara (cassie) shows her intense hatred of woodrow (jack) by condemning gus (ennis) for always running off to be with his "pard". that tart little revelation of clara's sexual jealously is gone. then there's the scene where the ur-dense woodrow warns maggie not to let jake spoon "compromise" her. the exchange in the novel is shorter and harsher; the film tones it down, and doesn't portray woodrow as quite the socially stupid, emotionally frozen stone he is. (when i read that scene in the novel, i wanted to punch woodrow in the stomach -- or worse.) there are other changes, some of them understandable. inish scull's eyelids are not cut off; to do so would like have required expensive cgi. but buffalo hump has no hump! (perhaps it was felt unreasonable to ask wes studi to schlep around such a huge prosthesis.) and buffalo hump's character is "kindler and gentler". he is nowhere nearly as grotesquely violent as he was in the novels.the only good thing about this near-turkey is steve zahn's remarkable performance -- not so much as gus mccrae, but as robert duvall playing gus mccrae. it is uncanny. he perfectly duplicates duvall's mannerisms and manner of speech, without ever appearing "deliberate" or self-conscious. as was duvall, he is wholly "within" the character. and he actually shows us gus becoming "more gus" in the third part.the best thing about "comanche moon" is that it won't spoil our affection for "lonesome dove", not just a great western, but a great american film.ps: for those who think rachel griffiths was over the top -- that's the way she was in the book.

i viewed the first two nights before coming to imdb looking for some actor info. i saw the 9+ rating which surprised me since i was not that impressed by what i'd seen. (as reference, i happen to believe lonesome dove was the best tv western ever. i grew up next to the mgm back lots in culver city in the 50s and have a certain sense of reverence about the western genre.) so i saw the glowing first review and decided to read "more". there i found several reviews with 1 or 2 stars that summed up my feelings well about the lack of character development, poor editing, feeling that it was shot on the universal back lot (mgm's is long gone), and overall impression that it was not going to come close to changing my feelings about ld. my impression is that the overwhelming vote of those who chose to write was "less than a 4.0".this got me to wondering about the process that yields a 9+ rating. if the people giving the 10s and 9s do not take the time to justify their vote, is the ballot box being stuffed by people with a monetary motivation? i have long used imdb as one tool to screen movies and thought it the best available. now i am not so sure.

did the writers pay people to come up here and write positive reviews? i mean, really, it's a bit hackneyed, and spike isn't that funny. he seems more like the serious guy trying too hard to be funny. there are so many mediocre gigs in this show; like once, the opening sketch was "talk show, apply directly to the forehead," over and over. and another that featured spike and another dude getting high, and it wasn't even funny. they didn't even do anything but sit around and laugh, over and over. ha ha! and another that featured spike talking to a korean guy who ate duck and told him that he had a pet duck. ha ha! i mean, really, spike just gets funny guests on his show, that's why people like this show

this show is like watching someone who is in training to someday host a show. there are some good comedy ideas and tons of mediocre ones. it doesn't look like the writers know the difference between what's funny and what's just weird or gross.it has its moments. when spike hosed down a neighbor who had been letting her dog soil his lawn repeatedly, it hit it's peak. but the hilarious moments are too few, and there's too many experimental comedy bits that miss the mark.the show's better than, say, watching a test pattern or the qvc network, but it needs some better writers.reading the glowingly positive imdb comments on this show, i am convinced that most of them were written by show staffers and by relatives and personal friends of spike.it just isn't very good most of the time.

maybe i'm alone here, but this is a crap show. i'm sorry but i was lured in when i found out about lil' bill o'reilly (which i had no idea came from this show until months later, and has honestly since lost its appeal) but i gave the show a fair shot. spike tries to hard to make himself into something he's not, which is to say, he tries to be human. fox didn't even bother to hide the strings when they took him out of the box he came in. his sketches try to hard, he himself isn't funny, and the writers are struggling to write material for a no-talent host. there is too much good tv out there to waste your time with this show, and fox.....fox we had some good times, but you need to get your f$%*ing act together and come up with something original instead of trying to be just another "me-too" network.

first of all..i've seen better acting and more realistic makeup in porno flicks. how bad was "chris moltisante" as stewie ungar? on the sopranos, chris is not taken too seriously and can be considered comic relief. and then throw in "bobby baccala" as one of his vegas cronies. it's just too much to take in a dramatic movie. neither actor can handle a serious role and is better suited as a second banana for tony,paulie, or uncle junior. and i want to know who did the makeup for this disaster? i want that person to be my make-up person over the next 25 years so i'll never age a day either. so that's all i'll write on this movie since it's not worth wasting too much more of my time. yes i do know that michael imperioli and steve schirippa are their real names.

what in the world! this piece of gambling cinema would have been suitable for the lifetime network. michael imperoli is a good actor but i think his portrayal as "stu" fell short. the montages were unbearable and too many. the supporting cast, where are you? whoever did the casting should be partially at fault. the cinematography was useless. a gambling story with an after school feel to it. stories of this sort should be left for the oliver stone's of the world. it would still suck ass but at least it would be fun to watch. it was an attempt that lost it's wheels before the race ever begun. mario andretti in the 1982 indy 500 came to mind.

what could've been a great film about the late poker pro (pre-poker craze) stu "the kid" unger turned into a disappointment.you can tell the filmmakers were working on a short-string budget. everything look filmed on the cheap. timelines seemed a bit off to me.casting michael imperoli from the sopranos was also a bad casting choice. he looked too old to play the baby-faced stu, he looked way too healthy for a coke addict (if you look at footage from the 1997 wsop main event, the real stu was so skinny and he practically had no nose from too much cocaine so he wore those sunglasses to hide them), and i kept expecting adriana to pop up and yell "chris-tu-phur!!!" also they skipped over the fact that he had a son from angie's previous relationship that committed suicide in the late '80s.every time i saw vincent van patten appear, i kept thinking he was going to announce "show tunes going off in stu's head." like he does on the wpt.if you're looking for real stuey footage, check espn classic because they rerun the 1997 wsop main event every so often. or try youtube. avoid this move like a bad beat.

i'm not even going to waste more time describing how bad this movie is. bottom line: it was horribly acted, had enormous plot holes and went absolutely nowhere. the only good thing about it was the description my digital cable gave for the movie: "a married man with a struggling business has a fling with his secretary." huh?? wrong movie apparently, although it may have made things slightly more interesting if any of the description were true.--shelly

"tart" is a pathetic attempt at film making which wanders around and among a bunch of manhattan teens exploring all the usual teen preppie stuff...sex, drugs, and classical music almost completely without story, focus, or purpose. griffith is in the film for about 2 minutes while swain dutifully works her way through another in her long list of dog flicks. nothing in this films works and wayne should consider getting a real job. not recommended for anyone. pu! ugh! (d)

why do people make bad movies? didn't anyone working on the picture know that what they were making had no point? there is something about this picture that threw me off, besides the fact that i found this "movie" to be unrealistic, pathetic, and poorly acted. i admire them for the try, but the "actors" in the movie at times seem to be trying to hard and no single character has substance or says anything mildly intelligent. this movie deserves zero stars. but i did not have that option, so it gets a 1.

it was so disjointed - it seemed to jump from place to place - and the "thief" was obvious. it was a poor man's (not to mention high school) "less than zero". i would pass on this movie as it has very little to add. so many issues are left unresolved, and that's okay - but the fact that it jumps around to the point where you wonder what's exactly going on is terrible. the voice-over is needed because the movie doesn't work on its own. avoid this movie, and watch something else about rich teen angst. i'm sure there are plenty of others to watch. don't waste your time on this.

this is probably the worst movie i've seen in a long time. independent or not, solid writing is a must. ditto for directing and acting. i know these actors can act (i've seen them in sporanos and more...) but this movie is very bad, very bad. maybe it's the script, maybe it's the director. probably a little of both.....probably a lot of both! technically ok, just bad, bad, bad... i have a theory that the backers for this movie also own the poker magazines, because i saw a very favorable review in one of the magazines. " hey' we made it, so it's gotta be good, right?" not so fast bucky. i know it takes a lot of hard work and money to even get a movie made, much less sold and distributed, and for that i commend these folks. but the final product, leave a bad taste in my mouth.p.s. i won a free rental and chose this movie from blockbuster. tomorrow i'm going to get my money back.

spoilers!i gave this film 2 out of 10 for 2 scenes that i will never forget.....by the way, my husband rented this surprising non-blow 'em up almost chick looking flick...but i guessed why when i saw the cover....girls in school uniforms....duh....lol....ah well, men if ya can't beat 'em join 'em.....;-)bijou philips, one of my favorites on the indie screen...too cute......not only gets into bestiality (her toy dog is the best lesbian in town according to her bubbly outrageous character)..that would be the first worthwhile scene..then she enters a restroom in a lovely gown & goes into a stall....after a bit she gets up, goes out to the party she & the pathetically sad 'cat' character are at,& hands a shiny silver ice bucket to the host of the party...the host looks in her precious silver ice bucket and says, "oh my god it's poo."i love bijou phillips myself for her creativity and unusual movie choices, this would definitely be one of them....and um, i would rent it for the poo scene if i were you.....i am not a big poo jokes fan, but it definitely puts the 'party people' in their place (they didn't look like they were having a good time anyway.....lol)...you will never forget these two scenes...hmm, but is that what we want in our databanks?....maybe you shouldn't follow my advice at all....loldominique swain is kind of squirrelly & sad in her confusing nonsensical role in 'tart'. i don't know, i can't decide if i like her because she is so into indie films?? indie films are awesome & all but couldn't she pick a few good ones? i am going to check out a few more of her movies and reserve judgment.... but this one was, (pardon the reference to beasts) a dog.....

for the first time in reviewing films, i found myself immediately uninterested in this story. i don't know if it was the way that it was filmed or the story behind the characters, but it felt bland, overused, and completely unoriginal. within the first thirty minutes, i found myself rather apathetic with all the characters and the story. i felt as if i had seen this structure before, and tart was providing nothing new to surprise me. after thinking that it may just be my mood, i stopped the film and chose to start it fresh in the morning, but the same feeling persisted. i just didn't care. that is not a good sign. the characters were bland. when i say bland, i literally mean that by watching them develop, you will never have any flavor hit your palate. the story seemed recycled, nearly to the point of plagiarism. now, i am not saying that christina wayne stole this story, but she added nothing fresh to the perspective. the casting was horrid, the underlying symbolism and themes were so far lost that no critic could find them (nor the characters), and the stories were vague and sloppy. you knew nothing about anyone or anything, and instead of pushing more emphasis on the characters, we instead found ourselves with drugs, minor sex, and money pushed into our faces. these are themes we have seen in every film since the dawn of film time, yet somehow could not be creatively captured by wayne.what immediately pulled me away from this story? it was mainly the characters. i have seen most of brad renfro's work, and honestly he needs to redefine himself. director larry clark has defined him, and oddly he cannot get out of that stereotypical character. within the first twenty minutes of renfro's screen time i was bored. i knew exactly what he was trying to portray and why. it was spectacular nor impressive, just repetitive. he needed to bring some excitement or suspense to his role, instead of just blandly playing this random socialite. without a strong character, the final climax of this film comes instead as a letdown. renfro did not showcase the best of his abilities in this film. while i am on the subject  nobody showcased the best of their abilities. what is going on with dominique swain, outside of lolita, i don't believe she has really emerged as an actress, and following-up with roles such as cat storm doesn't help. bijou phillips was the only actress that i witnessed actually try to bring something remarkable to the screen, sadly due to everyone else's horrid acting, she was lost. rambling here and there, and honestly nearly forgotten about during the second act. melanie griffith was a pointless cast and most of this film's budget probably went to her two scenes that she was in. maybe the rest of it went to the random guy from the kids in the hall, who desperately needs to place himself far away from this project.my biggest problem, outside of the acting, was the pacing of this film. nothing, and this is hard for me to say, but nothing gelled together. there were so many sub-stories happening throughout the course of the film that no actual substance was formed. the robberies, the teenage "angst and woe", the wealthy socialites learning how horrible real life is, the random kids in the hall guy, and even the ending just felt rushed and horribly edited together. with this shoddy craftsmanship the whole story never really formed any true shape. family structures were never defined, characters were never given any emotion, and all we are left with are bits and pieces of honest leftovers. wayne did not complete the task at hand.while i hate to put the entire burden on the director, with this film i am left with little choice. with a horrid title that just screamed the complete opposite of what this film was about, with amateurish directional ability the cast pretty much was able to give every emotion in every scenes, leaving us with disgusting acting and poor developments, and with vague storytelling it is hard to place any "good" behind tart. this was a film i had heard nothing about, and after viewing it i can see why. all wayne has done with this film is random take excerpts from other films that have done a better job of defining all the elements above and cut all together to make the film tart. it is hard for me to say this, but wayne ruined this film. while i don't believe there was much to fully take from the story, any remaining elements of excitement were drained as wayne took the helm. while most of the time you can credit some of the story, perhaps strong acting, or even the music, in tart you can credit nothing. from the opening sequence until the end, i felt like i was swimming through very lumpy oatmeal. no consistency, no strength.overall, this film is a waste of your time. if you are searching for some deep symbolic elements or possibly some banter on our society, you will not find it in this film. while i know that was what wayne was attempting to show, the final product seems like it was edited on an etch-a-sketch. it was an embarrassing film to sit through, and encourage nobody to pick it up. wayne threw to the wind all the teachings of her columbia university education and destroyed two hours of my life. avoid at all costs! grade: * out of *****

i rented this movie hoping that it would provide some good entertainment and some cool poker knowledge or stories. what i got was a documentary type look at an average guys life who happened to be really good at cards. do i want to see the romance with his wife? no do i want to see about everything that went on in this guy's life except poker? no. well thats what you get with this film. the acting is good for such a low budget piece of crap. the film never tries to break the mold or do anything original. it simply sleep walks its way through the script. the ending is disappointing and never really looks deep into ungar's mind. instead it focuses on what was already obvious. he was a drugged out card player with an average life not unlike any other average joe in vegas. the movie focuses on the aspects of his life that were un extraordinary rather than the extraordinary. the poker scenes in the entire film add up to about 4 minutes of footage. ungar's achievements of winning the wsop 3 times seem life after thoughts. a 10 year old could do a better job directing this movie.. or maybe it was the script being a piece of crap from the beginning that doomed this joke of a movie.if you want to see a film about gambling watch rounders. it at least has style.

20 people rated this a 10! that ballot box was stuffed better than a christmas turkey! speaking of turkey's, here's a traditional story hoping to piggy-back on the current poker craze - without success. told entirely in linear flashback, and when i say "told" i mean talked to death, this film never let's a picture suffice when words can be used to exposit.stu unger's childhood fascination with cards and his associations with hoodlums might sound like interesting movie material, but the director manages to suck the life out of them. at no point did i feel the least bit of sympathy for unger, a genius at cards who threw it all away on other forms of gambling at which he was not so proficient. of course, this leads, as we wade through three musical montages, to the inevitable downward spiral of drugs, loss of family, and finally his redemption (sort of). big yawn!

do people rate this movie highly because it's a foreign war movie???to me it's nothing more than a bad hollywood war movie in german.this movie is so bad on so many levels. to even mention it along with platoon or full metal jacket is absurd. the battle sequences are pathetic, the dialog and acting atrocious.this so called group of "storm troopers" are regulars in the wermacht. not ss troops. there is so much wrong with this movie it's sad. bad editing, bad acting. it's got it all.the movie goes on and on and on as though the audience should be made to suffer as much as the soldiers did.i read in a review that the this film had a $20 million budget.for real? where was it spent? in the fake train car sequences? in the pathetic "special effects"? ugh.as a wwii history buff, and wwii movie fan, i found this movie to be a serious disappointment.for an excellent alternative war movie check out "the beast". (not a wwii movie, but still outstanding)don't bother with this one.

one would think that with the incredible backdrop of wwii stalingrad that the writers would come up with a script. nope. there is no story here! it's like porn, vignettes of violence interrupted by pathetic, rote, and meaningless dialogue.a bunch of germans march around shooting and getting shot. slowly there are fewer germans to march around, shoot, and get shot. then there are no germans to march around, shoot, and get shot.pretty bad.chilcoot

the horror. the film about the nazis - the germans. the murderers of babies, young girls rapists ... for that they regret? what are they interested in doing thousands of miles away from germany? you do not come to mind is? fascists are now good samaritans? think, killed, tortured, 27 million people. no, of course, they do not want. they were forced to hitler, he gave each of them, and forced to kill: every fourth inhabitant of belarus peace, all jews, gypsies ... killing the slavs. the facts: at the beginning of the great patriotic war, when taken prisoner by fascist (german), they were defiant and brazen. we kill you all, and so on. since 1943, when they were taken captive, they suddenly became anti-fascists and peaceful peasants who were forced to hitler, and personally. for such films should be put to prison for life for the glorification of fascism. if you want to see what they did, yet went to stalingrad, then watch the movie "come and see" (1985).

with all of its technical flash, the 1993 "stalingrad" movie is very disappointing. before watching it i had read non-fiction accounts of the stalingrad campaign and had seen a lot of documentary footage and photographs of the actual battle and its participants. i don't think that any movie can really succeed in depicting the titanic struggle and suffering that actually occurred, but i still wanted to see what a relatively recent german movie production would be like. while there are a few good elements of this movie, overall it is a failure. to me the worst aspect is that it includes substantial anachronisms, and also some very contrived and clichéd elements, most glaringly in some encounters between a german officer and a soviet woman.also there are some ideological elements in the movie which result in very distorted perceptions, including what amounts to a caricature of a german chaplain, some overblown class-warfare messages, and problematic depictions of "good" vs. "bad" germans. certainly the german armed forces of world war ii included men who were able to maintain some decency throughout the war, and others who did very bad things, but the attempts in the movie to show this contrast are very simplistic and childish. i give "stalingrad" credit in the sense that it doesn't completely portray german troops in the simple demonic quality which is the stereotype that many people now have, yet the movie includes stereotypes of its own, such as an almost too-good-to-be-true infantryman who has attitudes more akin to the 1990's than the 1940's, and two completely evil infantrymen and a rear-echelon officer.some recent movies such as "stalingrad" and "saving private ryan" are frequently praised for their "authenticity" in depicting graphic scenes of combat, yet these same movies are deeply flawed and distorted in their depictions of the attitudes, values and behaviors of 1940's soldiers and civilians. "stalingrad" and "s.p.r" have major and minor characters who lack the unselfconscious stoicism that was common among regular people during the world war ii period. certainly soldiers throughout history have been notorious for their frequent grumbling and occasional cynicism, yet the self-absorbed, talky and touchy-feely characters in both of these movies are something else, and are much more prevalent in our world of today than they were in the 1940's. while many people these days like to denigrate war movies from the 40's and 50's which present more patriotic messages and aren't as graphic about combat, many of those earlier movies such as "battleground" are much more accurate in their depictions of typical soldiers' attitudes, and they are often successful in showing the horrible effects of war in more indirect ways.one well-done part of "stalingrad" is a battle between german infantry and soviet tanks, which does a reasonable job of capturing some of the horror and confusion in such combat."stalingrad" does a poor job though of showing the common look of the frontline soldier. part of this might be due to the difficulty in finding thin, haggard-looking extras in our pampered and well-fed america and western europe of today. also, too many of the german troops in the movie don't wear their uniforms and equipment properly, and don't display the professional bearing that was common in the german wehrmacht even during the years of german defeat. if you want to get a good idea of how the actual german troops looked, i recommend the following documentaries which contain footage of the stalingrad campaign: "the world at war," "war of the century" and "russia's war." also the books "operation barbarossa in photographs" by paul carell, "stalingrad" by geoffrey jukes and "stalingrad" by paul carell contain a great many helpful photos. books written about the battle by antony beevor and william craig are recommended also, and the latter one is especially good about the common soldiers and civilians on both sides.relatively recent movies which, in my opinion, are much better than "stalingrad" and "saving private ryan" in depicting attitudes and characters of persons during world war ii, and the general feel, look, horror and grittiness of that war, are "der untergang" ("the downfall") and "talvisota" ("the winter war"). while "a bridge too far" and "the longest day" cover events on the western front rather than in the east, they are also excellent war movies, and stick very close to factual accounts. the latter two movies lack some of the grit that is more prevalent in more recent films, but they compensate for that lack with their other strengths, including truthfulness.

this movie was terrible! my friend and i were so bored by it we fast forwarded through the last half of the movie just to see what happened. it's the typical sports thing, she either wins or she loses. the only remotely interesting thing was when the one guy refers to someone as a veg-e-tab-le. that will be a line my friend and i bring up for years to come reminding us of this colossal cheesy cliche waste of time

this movie was a complete waste of time. the soundtrack was bad, story was lame and predictable, and the acting was terrible. one of the worst 25 movies i have ever seen. after the first ten minutes, the rest of the film was completely obvious.

woa, talk about awful. do not waste your time. i wish i had seen the other use comments first. i have to admit, i didn't watch the whole thing. it was just too horrible. the worst, sappiest dialogue... i could go on and on. but what really made it unwatchable was the direction. the poor actors. you can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action. if you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance. this would not even be good as a made for tv flick. ouch!

...if you've been laughing too much for a long time, and need to take a break.after reading about 25 unfavorable reviews of this show, i decided to turn it on and check it out for myself. everything that each of those people have said about this show is absolutely true. mind of mencia is like a half hour version of mad tv, but with somehow worse jokes.one skit i had the displeasure of watching was "the second annual stereotype olympics". what's funny about black guy who has trouble swimming, or gay guy named "sparkles" that wins a banana eating contest? neither of these concepts is particularly novel, insightful, or amusing. do we really need a joke about star wars every episode? that movie came out like 30 years ago. mencia's solution to funny things up is toss in some stereotypes about hispanics and throw a few "beaners" in there; and call it a day to go home to roll around in his pile of money. pure comedic genius.then he blatantly ripped off jeff foxworthy on a second show i watched, with a "your gay if..." bit. you could just imagine the roaring laughter he got when he snook in a ryan-seacrest-is-gay joke. it's not like either of those has already been done to death.unless you're a big fan of jason friedberg and adam seltzer movies, please stay away from this show. especially when there are authentic comedians like dave chappelle out there who can joke about races and racism and still be insightful.

i'm surprised that the comparison hasn't been made yet between mind of mencia and the television program the awful truth, which ran a few years ago. helmed by controversial director michael moore, the show would begin, in the exact same manor as this show, with moore interacting with the audience, and introducing segments, namely short documentaries and skits, which had been put together in an attempt to provoke thoughts about current issues. the difference? mencia rarely delves past the superficial and the reactionary. what he says and does is often pandering and rude, and insults the ability of his audience to make decisions for themselves. there's a difference between being "edgy", which i have no problem with, but mencia tries too hard to accomplish this, and ends up coming off as arrogant, and with little backing. he does however, make points occasionally, but often in order to get to them, one has to sit through some pretty mind numbing attempted shock humor.

this is a great example of what happened at comedy central after dave chapelle left. here's the problem with carlos mencia. firstly, his birth name is ned holness, and was known that until he was 18, when he switched his name to ned arnel mencia. he was born in honduras, though he acts like he's from mexico. he grew up in the united states, as well.i might be able to forgive all that crap, but...he's been caught stealing other peoples material. joe rogan has been his most vocal critic in this way. the stereotype olympics was an idea he ripped off a couple of dj's from miami. he has stolen jokes from bill cosby. he stole george lopez's material in his own hbo special (13 minutes of it).he thinks what he's doing is so original, but dave chapelle and lisa lampanelli have been cracking on race for years before this idiot (amoung others).this show will crash and burn. the word beaner can't last that long before it gets old. he hasn't done anything new since the first episode."wanna hear a joke? a beaner jumping a fence!! that's funny for 3 seasons!" not.awful.

carlos mencia just plain isn't funny! his show is painful to watch because of that. his sketches/parodies are all very horrible, and this really just feels like a filler for the chapelle show, which while i'm not a big fan of that, it is much funnier than this trash. carlos mencia gives the stupid speeches and he all too often depends on finishing his monologues with a retarded voice and going "der, der der." it's just not funny. he often, when talking to others, makes puns. they are horrible and painful. when people don't laugh, he blames them...why would anyone laugh, he's not funny. he has an immature sense of humor in everything he does on this show, it's amazing that anyone but 3 year olds watch this. one of my least favorite things he does, is water down every topic and make it seem like a joke! i hope that this racist idiot gets taken off the air as soon as possible because he's dumbing down a station that doesn't need to be dumbed down anymore.

what is it now-a-days that minority comedians feel its okay to slander their minority and expect to get away with it? carlos mencia is no george lopez. there is a difference. when watching comedian carlos mencia, i think he hates his own people. and more than that, i think he was forced to pattern his show as the "hispanic/latino/spanish" version of the dave chappelle show. what a horrible mistake. (note to mencia: please do not do a "block party" movie. as much as i would like to see santana, tierra, el chicano, christina agullaria, jennifer lopez, shakira and the reunion of the cast of "xica da silva" on one stage, don't.) carlos mencia likes to use the word "beaners" as much as dave chappelle liked using the "n" word. neither is funny and neither is acceptable, even if it's from 'their own people'. carols mencia also likes to say, "if you're offended, too bad". it's not the offense, it's the defense because of what is being said and asked to be accepted.carols mencia goes further - he disrespects everyone for what he assumes is comedy. it's not comedy, it's not funny. there is a finesse to being able to look at yourself and make others laugh out of comedy and not laugh out of enforcing stereotypes that other races believed in the beginning.mind of mencia needs polishing because carlos mencia needs polishing. find out what is funny and not what will set more prejudices in motion and then - do it. until then, the show, mind of mencia is a pass.

i absolutely love stand-up comedy. i love to hear the raw thoughts of the stand-up on stage, as they are appealing to an audience of their peers different life experiences they have had, or things they have thought up or seen that they just thought were so ****ing stupid that they had to share it with someone. there used to be stand-ups who took on a persona that everyone could relate to (rodney dangerfield comes to mind) or were just so damn crazy that you couldn't help but laugh with them as they laughed at others (richard pryor). and then, there were the thought-provoking comics like george carlin, who, despite pretending to be a loon, was the smartest guy in the room, who appealed to people to rethink things they saw when they walked around, and realize just how screwed up things were, and how easily they could change things.now, this might seem to not have anything to do with "mind of mencia," which, as i agree with most commentators here, is comedy central's horrid solution to the loss of "chappelle's show," but it does. carlos mencia spends half of the show doing stand-up bits for his audience, sometimes on popular topics, most of the time on just racism and racial stereotypes. he tries to be all three of the above types of stand-ups. he makes a stage character, an every-day mexican named carlos who, despite stereotypes, is just your run-of-the-mill normal guy. he then proceeds to try to laugh at others, people he calls racist or just those that disagree with his opinion. and then, finally, he presents skits to the studio audience and the viewer, telling them that it will help them see his point of view.carlos mencia always says he's showing a point of view that people don't see, yet what he is really doing is not only promoting racist stereotypes that already exist and have been joked about to death, but he stupidly encourages people to hear them and do the one thing that helps keep them around:laugh.promoting stereotypes is usually the lowest, yet easiest, way to get laughs in stand-up. the best comedians, which, i fear, carlos mencia feels he is in good company with, don't have to resort to them. they talk universally, and ask you to laugh at absurdity, rather than with it, like mencia encourages. as he creates more skits or "real-life" situations that call for racism or the bashing of others with the use of it, he tells us, rather than asks us, to laugh, and actually presents these absurdities as truth, rather than just extremes of it. his show is an insult to the minds of those who watch it. mencia doesn't give us comedy and ask us to digest it and take from it what we want (something that, as much as i hate to compare the two, was "chappelle's show's" finest quality) he tells us exactly how we should view it and react to it---which, according to him, is to make a stupid face and say "dee dee dee!" this show is appropriately named. it is indeed a show about "the mind of mencia." it's mencia's mind, through and through, and, as such, is nothing more than dumb entertainment. the show is tailor-made to give life lessons to its core audience, 14-24 year olds, about how stereotypes are bad, but that racial bashing is alright to carlos mencia, and therefore should be alright to you!

yup, that's right folks, this is undoubtedly the worst show in the history of television. if you want to watch a sad, lonely and unfunny hack comedian attempt to entertain the masses with a half hour of pale and tired social ramblings that your mildly retarded cousin commented on at the thanksgiving dinner table then this might be the show for you. this is billed as edgy comedy my friends but to be honest this makes tim allen look like richard pryor. avoid at all costs. unless you're a masochist.

...so where's my friggin trophy? i seriously expected a banner and confetti to drop from my ceiling for watching a full 30 minutes of that crap. comedy central is truly dropping the ball lately, trying to fill the void left by chappelle with multiple seasons of a retarded man impersonating retarded men. dah duh nah!! if you pay attention to the show, you'll notice that when mencia isn't stuttering over punchlines and laughing at his own skits, he only makes exaggerated observations which seem to lack any sense of humor. you ever notice how people in buick's drive really slow? it's like dah duh nah! not even the midgets and half naked hot chicks manage to distract from mencia's distinct lack of talent. furthermore, mencia isn't even a "wetback" as he constantly and adamantly proclaims he is, which makes him a fraud on top of it all.if anything good could be said about mencia, it's his effort. the man clearly has no talent, but like a wounded antelope in the mouth of a hungry alligator, god knows he's trying.

i haven't watched this show in months, but for a while i was forced to watch it every day because i had a roommate that liked it. so maybe it's undergone some vast improvement in all that time, although the commercials and the 4.2 rating on imdb aren't a good sign.it was clearly just a quick replacement for chappelle's show. even mencia says so. and while i wasn't even that big a fan of chappelle's show, his jokes were at least original and clever (and far edgier than mencia has ever been). mencia's jokes are completely unoriginal and stale. if you can't see that, i guess there's just no hope for you. but to be fair, here are some examples: --mencia blatantly rips off chapelle's lil jon skit. just takes it.--"south park" makes an episode about scientology. one week later, mencia has a joke on his show about how offensive he is to scientologists. bear in mind the joke isn't about scientologists, but about how much he's offended them on his show. when up to this point, he has never made a single scientology joke, ever.--after hurricane katrina, two ap photos go around the internet showing a black man "looting" groceries and a white woman "finding" them. weeks later, after millions of people have already seen this, mencia presents it on his show as if he discovered it and it's being shown for the first time (the daily show would have been on something like that in a day). pathetic.even more annoying than the joke-stealing is the way carlos has promoted himself and his show, claiming he's breaking down some sort of pc barrier (whatever) and that if you aren't laughing, you must be a weak prude who can't handle any jokes about race. yes, carlos, it's not because you're not funny, it's because we're all too offended to laugh (if that was really true, then why was chappelle's show so popular?). he constantly berates his audience for "not getting it" if he doesn't get enough laughs, and often repeats and explains his jokes, a technique most comedians stop using by age 14.the worst part is that mencia does not seem to be very intelligent. it's sort of tragic that there are dozens of funnier, more insightful comedians out there trying to make it while this guy is rolling in money. his show is supposedly the third highest rated on comedy central, which is baffling (again, it has a 4.2 rating on this site). where the hell are they getting these numbers?? comedy central tries to bill itself as an "edgy" station, but as long as it tries to appeal to the dumbest audience possible, that will never be the case.

i thought "puppets making crank phone calls" was pretty low, but i don't believe that carlos mencia's show even qualifies as comedy. his main objective is to make the audience incredibly uncomfortable while using the word "beaner" as many times as he possible can. i have never felt compelled to write a review declaring the awfulness of anything on imdb before, but i really do hope this show is never renewed or rerun.mencia is trying to be the next dave chapelle, and perhaps he was only hired by the network because they hoped he would fill those shoes. it is obvious right down to the rip of chapelle's intro (blues guys vs. mariachi band). however, mencia has absolutely *no* attitude, and does not delve into popular views of the hispanic culture enough to come up with a creative poke at it each time. instead he sticks to a small number of hardly-shocking nicknames for his fellow latinos and makes "jokes" about immigration. every once in a while, he'll take advantage of the slight darkness of his skin to make fun of someone else, like middle eastern cultures. these jokes mainly consist of reiterating every joke or stereotype made against the culture, and perhaps some incredibly old topics (such as 9/11), in a watered down, stand-up style, while he laughs at himself to cover up the audience's style. i think he's too afraid of really offending anyone, so it just makes the viewer feel awkward. he also beats jokes to death. if you've ever seen "why the f*** is this news?" you'll know what i'm talking about. it's funny at first, but he just rambles on and on and becomes captain obvious at some point. it's a trainwreck that is purely painful to watch.

this is the most pitiful excuse for a comedy show i've ever seen. i'm confounded that this guy was given his own show. it smells of complete and utter desperation on the part of comedy central, trying to fill the void left by the talented and incomparable dave chapelle. he's a tip from ned's bag of comedy gold: is a punchline not funny? need to give it that extra push into hilarity? f***ing yell it at the top of your lungs. simple, no? and as an added bonus....finish half your jokes with...then you're re-tah-ded!! or duh-du-duuuuhhhh! oh man. so....funny. beaner...hilarious. wetback....does the laughter ever stop?to illustrate my point in a more cerebral way, i'll cite an example. mencia jokes about how "retarded" it is to rebuild new orleans, because it's so close to the water. genius. the line of distinction between a great comedian and a hack has never been drawn so clearly. while a good comedian would find hidden humor in the tragedy, finding subtle ways of weaving a joke into something that we can all laugh at and take solace in, ned goes for the obvious. move the city. great. wait, is that funny? ned doesn't have the intellectual capacity to find the deepest meaning of things. the hurricane didn't flood the city, ned. the levee project was underfunded and in serious need of federal dollars...and behold! they broke. i guess that's god's way of telling us we shouldn't be there. after all, he's got a seat in congress. what a fool.chapelle was a master of turning a tired racial comedic spin on its head. he was effortless at it, and at all points, we were laughing with him. while mencia talks about black people not being able to swim *yawn,* chapelle took it 300 yards further with the black and blind white supremesist. you don't have to be scathing to be edgy. you have to be original. mencia and his legions of fans are like that closeted gay dude who laughs all too emphatically at gay jokes, thinking it somehow masks his own insecurities. except of course, with ned, he's laughing all too emphatically at the "retards." du-du-duuuuh.

this is one of the most ridiculous westerns that hollywood ever made. gary cooper plays 'reb hollister', a former confederate officer wanted by the law. he meets up with a moron named weatherby, played by leif erickson, who is a u.s. marshal with no knowledge of firearms. weatherby is on his way to dallas to see his fiancee, tonia robles, played by ruth roman. senor robles, tonia's father, has plenty of men, but they can't seem to be able to keep an eye on his cattle, which are regularly rustled by the marlow brothers. will marlow, played by raymond massey, has financed the loan on the robles estate, making things completely absurd. he even has the power to call for mortgage payments before they're due, simply because he feels like it.since weatherby is a boston boy who can't fight, since he only became a marshal so he could visit his fiancee, tonia, (just another instance of more plot nonsense. are we to assume that you only have to pass a written test to get this job? wait a minute, this guy couldn't pass the written test either.) he switches identities with reb hollister, who of course is an expert gunman. reb takes the liberty of greeting weatherby's girl with a passionate kiss, while weatherby looks on like an idiot. gary cooper, hollywood's number one stud, is in fine form here as reb. before the movie's done, not only does he take weatherby's job, he steals his fiancee also, and ruth roman as tonia, falls for him so hard and so fast that she gives chump leif erickson the brush-off before the films little more than half over.there isn't a shred of plot credibility in the whole film, so despite the good cast and lush photography, the film is a dud. and cooper's character is a complete heel to boot. the film also stars barbara payton as brant marlow's girl, a beautiful and talented actress who squandered away her chances, unfortunately, by making too many headlines for the wrong reasons. i strongly suggest you pass this one up.

stylized hollywood westerns, full of familiar conventions, seem to have eternal life and this is an avatar. everything in it seems to have been scraped out of the back of a drawer from 1939, a larger budget applied, and this production its issue.gary cooper has played this sort of role dozens of times -- the displaced southerner, fast on the draw and firm with honor, though kinda easy going whenever possible. he plays blayde hollister who travels to texas looking for the gang who destroyed his cotton plantation. he wears a buckskin-fringed shirt and packs two ivory-handled six shooters. he speaks with a countrified accent -- "a feller could get hurt doin' this." (cf., "sergeant york.") the gang is led by sneering raymond massey, who buys and sells land, usually by underhanded means whenever possible. the gang includes steve cochran, who cannot play a westerner though he's very good at scum bags in general. the requisite woman is ruth roman, daughter of the mexican plantation owner, who looks and speaks about as mexican as a boston brown betty.i don't think i'll bother too much with the plot. no doubt someone has gone into it in some detail and it's not worth much more mention. as in any 1939 western, it's labyrinthine. everyone except cooper and his friends are underhanded and there are multiple double crosses and switched identities and hidden secrets.everything is retro. the plot, the dialog, the wardrobe, even the music. the score is by warner's stalwart max steiner. he's the guy that scored "king kong." that was 1932. this movie was released in 1950.cooper's name, by the way -- "blayde hollister" -- prompted me to look through the records of the raca -- the real american cowboy associaton -- to see if that name cropped up in their archives, which date from the beginning of time to february 4th, 1911, when the last real cowboy passed away due to an unfortunate encounter with a deranged peccary. there has never been a real cowboy with the name blayde. hollister, yes, but not blayde. as a matter of fact, there is no record of any real cowboy named wade, luke, cole, or matt either. the most popular names for genuine cowboys, in descending order of frequency, were clarence, mortimer, noble, nebukadnezzar, plautus, pinchbeck, and hortense.if this movie had been released in 1939, it would have been routine. in 1950, it is a calamitous monument in the history of human recycling.

this is an utterly forgettable picture. a friend of mine picked it up in a bargain bin at a local rental place for $.50. he should have demanded a refund. or at least a discount.the plot is something like this: a giant monster threatens the earth and aliens decide that the most average human being on the planet must be chosen to save the earth. thus a tiny holographic space alien appears before a postal worker and tells him that he's "it."the devil is in the details when it's time to rate a movie, and on that count zarkorr! the invader fails miserably. the monster zarkorr only has a few brief moments on the screen, totaling maybe 5 minutes tops (with a generous estimate). the cute alien hologram has even less screen time and might be the most interesting character to look at, and only because she's wearing a "teeny bopper" stereotype outfit, complete with a teasingly short pleated skirt. the climactic final battle with the monster is over before you can say "whiskey tango foxtrot, over." in the next moment you are left to ponder whether you've just experienced a train wreck or if someone just drained 3 pints of blood out of you.admittedly though, this movie did deliver one line that my friends and i to this day still repeat and laugh at and was about the only bright spot in this otherwise abysmal picture. as the cast of "protagonists" is being "interrogated" by the fuzz, one of them responds to the questions with the statement "what are you, some kind of a question asker?" it is delivered in such a preposterous manner that if you're sitting with a group of friends (who won't be your friends long if you actually talked your friend into watching this) you may actually experience a howl or two of incredulous laughter.while this is no manos or eegah (it's not even bad enough to be classically bad) this movie will still bore you with its awful dialog, unimaginative characters, and nonexistent special effects and still deserves to inhabit the bottom 100.1.5/10

zarkorr is one bad movie. this doesn't even rate in the so bad its good category. it's just bad. from the (lack of) set design to the acting to the special effects, everything about this movie stinks. for starters, the film looks like it was filmed in just empty rooms with a couple of props thrown in to make it look good. then we get acting that is so bad that it makes a high school play look like it was an oscar candidate. and to top it all off, there's the special effects that are so bad that they look like an amateur pulled them off in their garage. the towns that the monster is supposedly crushing look like my nephew's train set. so obviously fake that they scream out at the viewer. the only good thing about the movie is the monster suit. its just too bad that they spent all their budget on that and left nothing for the rest of the film. and maybe a decent script would have helped too.

aliens let lose a giant monster named zarkorr, then send down a hologram that looks your average stupid teenage girl to tell postman, tommy ward (rhys pugh, in the only movie you ever see him in) that has been chosen to fight. also if he loses the plant goes doom, so he goes off to fight zarkorr the invader! this movie is bad, very bad. so bad it you need negative numbers just to gave it a rattan. horridly written, bad directing, way below power rangers over-the-top wooden acting that you're just whiting for a horde of lumberjacks to come out of no where and cut them down! and don't get me started on the theme song at the end. the people who made this stemming pall of s$@# should not be aloud near a camera or any thing to do with films. zarkorr is a cool looking monster that should have been in a movie a million times better than this one. do your self a favour and don't see this movie, it's 80 or so minute of life. the actors that are in this never worked again by way.3/10

ok, so it's a silly movie, but i think they knew that when they made it. and there are some neat little twists on the otherwise tired, overdone "godzilla"-type genre. borrowed a tape just because i knew someone in it, but i did loan it out to a couple pals, who also kinda liked it.

edge vs. michaels-boring in general (loved the sweet chin music into the chair) 4/10 taker vs. heidenreich-one of the worst matches i've seen, predictable as hell 1/10 tripe threat wwe match-why do i watch them, nobody ever wins a championship at the rumble, its not the main event. liked it when show drove jbl through the wall. 3/10 world heavyweight championship-pretty ok match, kind of more a beat-down by tripe h than a match, but i was happy to see it after watching crap. 5/10 royal rumble-good rumble,liked the brand showdown,the hassan thing, and the end. 7/10 overall still crap. why does anyone watch the rumble???

the plot: four people are caught in an elevator. one is a business man, the annoying kind who is aggressive and complains about everything and everyone and is a walking-talking sample of distilled stress and hostility. then there's his colleague, a woman who is much more pleasant in her character. a teenage rebel who just broke into a coke machine and by his mere presence drives the businessman mad, and an older guy who just stole 100,000dm make up the rest of the cast...the movie is all about how they cope with their problem, as time goes on and on without any success in reaching the outside world, as the lights go out, and as the cables begin to snap one after the other....and yet, it isn't too exciting. the characters are stereotypes. the story is stupid and unlikely (how could so many things go so wrong in just one elevator?). you don't like the characters very much, you just hate one of them. and all the twists and turns in the plot are not contributing to the excitement, they are just stupid excuses for filling yet another few minutes with dialogue as the screenwriters keep running out of inspiration and ink on a full-length movie set in an elevator.let's just hope "phone booth" will be a better effort...

by strange coincidence i've started to watch this move straight after brice de nice and the good thing was that not many movies could be worst than brice de nice, so i was really looking forward for something better which would make me forget this horrible flop.unfortunately oss-117 again left me disappointed - i don't know, maybe it's just problem with translations, but since "diner de cons" i haven't seen any french comedy that i would call really good. even when i look at the reviews on imdb only people from france are giving the oss-117 high notes...for me this movie didn't really work - in some parts is as funny as real bond movies, in others jokes were a little bit too predictable or too corny.

cultural vandalism is the new hallmark production of gulliver's travels an act of cultural vandalism? not literally. after all, not a single copy of the book is burned. but if this is the only gulliver people are exposed toand to many it will bethose people will not get anything like what jonathan swift intended. were jonathan swift alive, hallmark could be sued for moral rights violations and they'd lose. that's a good way to think before starting a project using someone else's ideas.swift's masterpiece is an extraordinary vision of humanity. through his hero, gulliver, he travels to places that make him feel big, small, shat on and human. the little people in lilleput are small in every way. petty and stupid, they fight, the big-enders and little- enders, interminable wars of annihilation over which end of their soft-boiled eggs are opened at the breakfast table. sounds a bit like us.i forget most of the rest: it's been years since i read it. the tv show reminded me of a few things and, on the bright side, it made me want to read it again.this gift to mankind has been shat on, like gulligan under the boughs beneath the vulgar yahoos, and danson, steenbergen and especially two great actors, peter o'toole and edward fox, ought to be thoroughly ashamed. some "creative person" got the bright idea to put the focus on "the star:" gulliver, played by ted danson, whose acting is just plain bad. he portrays gulliver as insane. all his travels were made up. weeeeel. yeeeaaah! of course swift made up gulliver! naturally, the lands he visited were imaginary: that's called fiction. his purpose was to talk about humankind and our, often awful, relations with each other. the travels of his imaginary character to imaginary lands is his method. but these people treat imagination as a disease and anyone who has a moment that hallmark couldn't turn into one of its anodyne cards is suspect.i can sure see why hallmark would produce this crap. it's so bad that o'toole, always profound, seems as little as his lilliputian character. he's in character, of course, while commenting on the character simultaneously, as many, if not all great actors do. informing the character sheds light on it. our light completes the character. it becomes three dimensional through this act of psychic triangulation. most actors do this very subtly, like hopkins in "the remains of the day." others, like nicholson, in most things in the last twenty years, play the two parts pretty broadly apart. nicholson actually plays on the relationship of his two points and with us too: with him it's all cat's cradle and he, chuckling away, holds all the strings. great fun, as is o'toole. but something here is lacking. he is shouting into a megaphone (as great as ever) and all one senses is a hollow shell standing under him.that's because it is. look up "anodyne" and there ought to be the word "hallmark" as a synonym. harmless, bland, inoffensive: hallmark is the doll who can't pee because she has no genitals: it is the norm, the average, the person of no distinction. hallmark's hallmark is to have no hallmark. i never suspected that such people despise those who have imagination quite so much. suddenly, pound's "disney against the meta-physicals" stands out in bold type. or einstein's "men of genius always will be violently opposed by mediocre minds." indeed, anyone, to this mediocre type, who has an answer to any question other than "a)" or "b)" is suspect. who more distinctive then that a man who journeys to the darker places of the human soul and shines his little flashlight to illuminate what can be found there? hence the act of vandalism. the taliban destroyed the buddhas in afghanistan, the palestinians the oldest synagogue in the world at jericho, the barbarians the great statuary of the classical age and these things are obviously vandalism. hallmark endeavors to protect us from foreign foes by undermining our own culture; the one that feeds and sustains them. and us.please buy a copy of gulliver's travels wherever you live, and read it. or order it online. i like to use abe books.

lets be realistic here. this is one of the worst shows i have ever seen. my wife and kids showed real promise in its first season and only went down hill after that. it is so bad that words do not describe. the acting and writing are so dreadful on a consistent basis i wonder if damon wayans was producing such an atrocious show on purpose. from top to bottom every performance is ridiculous. damon wayans completely phones it in and george gore ii is so horrible i cringe at every over-acted line. can anyone really watch this show and find it to be entertaining let alone funny? please i implore you. do not watch this show. as soon as tv affiliates stop picking this up in syndication we can finally be rid of this absolute garbage.

i never really started watching the show until it was canceled and started showing re-runs. i actually enjoyed it for the first to third season. once i saw the fourth and fifth one i was beginning to get irate. the first problem was that they did that irrelevant, scenario of history repeating itself (jr having a kid like his parents did). the second had to be the one where they had everyone paired up with someone (ex: katie and franklin) . the third one was when they made jr even more idiotic than before which was beginning to be tedious and vexing to the point where i wanted to go into the t.v. and beat the stupidity out of him until he's unconscious . the fourth one had to be that zealous dork that clarie claimed as a boyfriend. the fifth one had to be katie, she was beginning to be too good for herself and was treated her "boyfriend" franklin like the pushover he was. the last but not least was noah gray-cabey!! franklin, franklin was just scary. it was like watching a terrible combination of urkle and tj henderson only more annoying!!! they seriously jumped the shark when came he to the show. there was little to no realism to his character and the way he laughed was a sign of obvious force showing that noah can't act. eveytime i saw that kid just made me want slap he silly. however, b.f.(before frank) this show was funny and very entertaining.

my wife and kids was billed as the 00s very own cosby show- but unlike the latter, it was unfunny and unwatchable. in fact, it is so poorly written and some of the jokes revolve around michael mickey taking michael jr's dumbness and the fact that he is such a loser- which got more and more tedious and annoying as the show went on.what was supposed to have been a promising hit, eventually turned into a dumb, silly show later on where the ideas became so ott and ridiculous. and as for the second claire, i ended up disliking this character so much: she became a spoilt, childish and moaning teenage brat, in most of the later episodes.mwak was no cosby show trend setter, rather it was just a poor black sitcom by general standards.

this is a painfully slow story about the last days of 1999 when a strange disease breaks out and... i stopped caring. this is suppose to be about two people who live over or under each other in an apartment complex. there's a leak and a plumber put a hole in the man's floor so you can see into the woman's below apartment. also since there is a crisis going on much of the dialog is actually news reports...sounds promising?not really.i became distracted and started doing other things which is deadly in a subtitled film. basically i started not watching, which made events seem even more surreal when i did look up.it may work for you, it didn't for me.

i loathe, despise, and hate this film with a passion that makes the red hot gates of hell look cold by comparison. it's nothing but a campy, frightening, and completly shoddy trip down memory lane to that oh-so-nasty time, the 70's, a decade im glad i wasnt a part of if this absolute trite is all that was on offer!the animation is sickeningly dated, not least of all with it's tacky, missing frames, and characters with huge, bulbous heads, this film is an eye-sore. from the knowing, snide nod to the parents with the freakily gay sea horse, and it's camp hand motions and kenneth williams-esque voice, to the overtly, unsubtly druggy anthem, high cockalorum, this film, im sad to say, is one that was forced upon me as a child and i have never fully recovered from the terror it caused me....this ghastly display of complete terribleness should carry an r rated certificate, so disturbing it is in it's contents!

this is a dreadful adaption of charles kingsley's story. the animation is, to put it bluntly, awful. and the songs are a disgrace to film songs, epsecially the "high cockororim" song, which they keep repeating. i feel sorry for jon pertwee and david jason, 2 of britain's finest talents, providing the voice for the depressing animation sequence. bernerd cirbbins tries his best to perform in this awful production ,but fails.avoid this film at all costs, even if it is the last film on this planet!

classic author c.s. lewis once wrote an essay stating that no children's story is worth the reading, viewing etcetera if it can only be enjoyed by children. i'd say this film is an easy one to hold up as a defence of his argument.around the age of five or six, i loved it, tracked it down only three or four years later and found it to be wet, poorly animated, dully and confusingly written, and with distressingly repetitive and awful songs (i'm looking t you, hi-cockalorum), showing a production aiming at joyful silliness and whimsy, but resulting with an ugly, twee, frustrating mess.by all means, show this to your infant, but i would heartily recommend that you don't buy a copy or attempt to sit in on the viewing. if you want something set in the same era but with genuine charm and wit, go after 'oliver twist' or the bbc's brilliant adaptation of 'the box of delights'.

i was 12 when this film was released and adored it. the song's were inspiring and it made me feel good, watching it several time's at the cinema. i actually had the soundtrack album and played the song's over and over.26 years later...i'm ashamed. just sat and watched it with my 2 daughters who enjoyed it lot's but my cynical older grown up eyes hated it. it's very poorly directed in many places and considering it was lionel jeffries directing i really wanted to enjoy it. the character animation was so rough yet the backgrounds were quite good. i remember the critics at the time saying that it was a poor film and was horrified but now i agree.it is an old film yes, compared to what can be achieved now, maybe that's why i thought it was good then. but that does not excuse it for it's poor acting, directing and sloppiness. the main child actor's voice seem's dubbed which is very distracting too. can't quite see what they were trying achieve when it was being made, all that it become was a weak film.

very resistible but ultimately harmless film version of the children's literary classic which incorporates an animated portion in the style of mary poppins (1964) and bedknobs and broomsticks (1971). the human cast is very distinguished - james mason, billie whitelaw, david tomlinson, joan greenwood, bernard cribbins - but their roles range from the miscast (a 69 year-old mason as a thieving chimney-sweep!) to the inconsequential (greenwood as a befuddled aristocrat) to the bizarre (whitelaw plays several 'exotic' characters - including a circus performer, an old hag, a maid and a fairy - for no apparent reason).the animated segment of the film, handled by a group of east-european animators, is hardly inspired but mildly enjoyable in itself and, as usual, with this type of thing, there is an assortment of songs one has to put up with, one of which in particular is reprised far too often for its own good. the film was directed by noted character actor jeffries who had previously directed (far more successfully) other children's films namely the railway children (1970) and the amazing mr. blunden (1972; which i've yet to watch myself but which was released some time ago on r2 dvd by anchor bay uk).

a real hoot, unintentionally. sidney portier's character is so sweet and lovable you want to smack him. nothing about this movie rings true. and it's boring to boot.

maybe this wowed them in the 50's, but this is one of those flicks that doesn't age well. it's got that preachy, earnest, downtrodden working man vibe of a 2nd rate rod serling live tv "playhouse" broadcast. the "plot" is by the book, the cassevetes character's troubled background seems tacked-on, and the love interest is unconvincing and half-hearted.sidney portier gives an ok performance, but man he sure was an annoying, haughty snot. if i had to work with this guy in a warehouse i'd probably want to hit him with a grappling hook too. jack warden is good, because as usual, he plays jack warden.like 90% of the films rated on imdb (whether they are classics, mediocre or crapola) somehow this one gets rated with 7-point-some-stars. it is in no way deserving of that. save your time

pat o'brien portrays knute rockne, the all-american notre dame football coach. no doubt, this film will be considerably more appealing to those interested in some aspect of "knute rockne all-american notre dame football" - probably, it's most interesting to serious followers of football and/or notre dame football. you will see some good documentary-style film footage.otherwise, it's difficult to recommend this as a film. it's not much more than an historical document. you'll "know" the end is near when gale page gets a chill - and, don't blink or you'll miss ronald reagan doing, of all things, "camille"! *** knute rockne - all-american (1940) lloyd bacon ~ pat o'brien, gale page, ronald reagan

forced, cloying, formulaic. do these adjectives make you want to run to rent his? miriam hopkins was brilliant in the original "dr. jekyl and mr. hyde." a few other early movies of hers, notably "the story of temple drake," are never shown but said to be excellent.here, she is cutesy, bossy, and thoroughly unappealing. ray milland as a greeniwch village bohemian not at all convincing.the two child performers are creepy and also bear no relation to the village as it was then.speaking as a native of greenwich village, i find the setting ersatz, generic, and phony. not that i was around for a couple generations but my relatives were there in 1937. it isn't funny. it isn't remotely authentic. we don't care about the characters.so many movies were made about the struggling masses vs the capitalists at this time, and done with elan. "easy living" comes to mind. it didn't take place in the village. but it rings very true. this rings with a thudding knell.

the most irritating thing about "dies d'agost" (august days) is not simply that nothing happens in this film but that director marc recha has the nerve to pretend that this film is some sort of homage to leftist catalan journalist ramon barnils. unless mentioning barnils' name a few times constitutes an "homage," this pretense is an utter fraud. you will learn virtually nothing about barnils in this film nor about the spanish civil war (1936-1939) nor about the special role of catalunya in that war. you also will not learn about the collective punishment inflicted on the heroic catalan people for years afterward by the victorious and vindictive franco.the footage of the catalan countryside is very beautiful, of course, but "dies d'agost" does not have an extensive and varied enough collection of such scenes to qualify as a travelogue. the large number of stills shown -- not very illuminating images of the forest floor, for example -- is the clearest indication of the paucity of ideas here. the aimless drift of brothers marc and david during their camping trip does not produce compelling cinema. on the contrary, one's strongest impression is of a film made by and for spaced-out, middle-aged hippies. don't waste your time. read a good book about the spanish civil war instead. (i recommend felix morrow's scathingly anti-stalinist "revolution and counter-revolution in spain," which contains a gripping account of the 1937 barcelona uprising.)barry freed

if you are a catalan nationalist anarcho-socialist with unnuanced reverence for the mythologies of the spanish republic, this movie may be for you. two brothers, real-life ones (one of them being marc recha himself), re-enact a fictional version of a real-life journey they had made through the spectacular catalan countryside, and history is evoked (pans of bullet-holed walls, artillery booms on the soundtrack) but not shown. there is very little dialog, and most of it is incidental: the story is told in a third-person voice-over, the voice being that of an actress impersonating the real-life sister of the real-life brothers. the images have little to do with what story line there is, which isn't much. many are stunning, brooding pans across stark semi-arid mountains and rivers (think terrence malick or gus van sant -- there's not a little of both "gerry" and "last days" here), interspersed with some stunning still images and motionless frames. these are best enjoyed within the film's superb natural sound environment and without the ultimately tedious narration or even the occasional background music (some quite good, some rather odd, but all gratuitous). the best of what this movie has to say is said in these sequences, with their occasional comment-less inclusion of power stations and dams.the relationship between the brothers is left sketchy and generic; a major character is a man-biting catfish, never shown. the more the catalano-nationalist anarcho-whateverist commitments of the director are suggested, the more the film's richer, unspoken message is subverted and the more irritatingly narcissistic the experience becomes. though the director said at the nyff screening that the film was conceived from the beginning with its third-person narrative, i'd like to see a version of it without the narrative or the music and with only the natural soundtrack and minimalist dialog -- the result might be more moving, and would in any case not be that much less baffling.meantime, this is most likely the only film you will see this year in which a guy strides into the frame with a cloth object (the bathing suit he had been wearing?) dangling from his penis. this is one of the few moments in the whole movie in which your interest is (sorry) pricked by something that's actually happening on screen (what is that? why's it hanging there?), but, as usual, no answers are provided. very warholian, very sixties, and a not a little tiresome.

jason connery is not an actor; he is the son of an actor. his macbeth is the worst i have ever seen. oh yes, he murders king duncan, but he also kills william shakespeare. his wife is even worse. please, give me polanski's version on dvd, so i can forget this monster. jon finch, orson welles, laurence olivier, there you have actors!

i have just watched this "latest" version of macbeth and was pleasantly surprised with the solid acting and obvious effort that had to turn a low budget historical piece into a fully fledged watchable movie.one note however, the music was very lame and added nothing to the intensity of the film and sounded like someone with a keyboard and a bunch of samplers as opposed to a full orchestral score. i think paul farrer needs to get his act together!!!

i had high hopes for this production, being one of my favourite works.indeed, a lot of it is reasonable: helen baxendale is not a bad lady macbeth, but lacks the devilry which the original character is infused with. many of the minor characters do well, and the scottish settings are superb.the big disappointment to me is jason connery in the title role: he seems to be reading his lines off a cue card with the wrong glasses - surely for the first time, as well. he can do so much better. any production when compared to the sublime ian mckellen (macbeth 1979)who to my mind gave the gold standard performance, is going to struggle to be appreciated, but i actually fell asleep and had to rewind this one before i could get through it - hardly a great sign.honestly, one to avoid.

macbeth, i've always thought, is the most accessible of shakespeare's 'great period' plays. compact, focused, with heaps of violence, it should have been the play most open to screen adaptations. i'm not aware of a really good rendering of the story, however - the best effort being orson welles's vigorous shoestring version. to the list of macbotches we must add the connery/baxendale effort.(it seems it was not a 'film adaptation' at all, but a tv version that was given a theatrical release, post luhrman's romeo + juliet and branagh's hamlet. that might explain some of its flaws, but doesn't excuse them.) it starts well, with a feisty battle sequence with pleasingly grisly witches looking on. poor old gray malkin and paddock are cut from the opening scene, but they aren't alone for long. in quick order they are joined by the bloodied sargent and his account of the battle, the treachery of the thane of cawdor, the luckless master o' the tiger, even macbeth's meeting with duncan when he is invested as thane of cawdor. all of these had virtues that plead like angels trumpet tongued against the dark damnation of their sending off, but sent off they are. these aren't the only cuts, either. this is macbeth in a hurry.from the opening battle we are pitched directly into macbeth's encounter with the witches, which is well done. brian blessed, curiously, directed the witchy sequences, and he has great fun with the special effects as macbeth and banquo are told of their fates. jason connery as macbeth is awkward, obviously unsure what to make of the verse. graham mactavish as banquo, on the other hand, is capable, making his lines natural and easy. within a few minutes of connery's mumbling, the viewer is struck the urge to see the roles reversed and mactavish in the title role. no wonder macbeth felt he needed to kill him.these first few minutes marks the high point of the film. from there we move to helen baxendale receiving word of her husband. she's as lost as connery, and denied the beard that he gets to hide behind. her "unsex me here" invocation of evil is embarrassing, not unsettling. there are some reasonably clever touches - macbeth's "we will speak further" is not a sign of his hesitancy in the face of his wife's wicked ambition, but his attempt to silence her prattling as he throws her onto the bed.the acting of the leads is the biggest let down. connery's method consists of staring glazedly about the screen while he mumbles his monologues via voice-over. baxendale looks pinched and neurotic. an attempt to do something interesting with "is this a dagger" - the fantastical dagger is a shadow cast by a cross on an altar - falls flat due to connery's poor delivery and sloppy direction, which mars the production throughout. we accompany lady macbeth back into the murder chamber, where she gets to stab the reviving duncan, but the effect is comic, not dramatic.big scenes are botched - the appearance of banquo at the feast is made incomprehensible through attempts to mix subjective rendering of macbeth's delusion with what those around him see, or don't see. the second meeting with the witches is even less coherent, and the prophetic visions are confusing. timing seems to be an issue here - banquo's banquet is the centrepoint of the play, but the film moves rapidly towards conclusion after it, giving it an unbalanced feel and no scope for the intricacies of the riddles macbeth is caught in to be appreciated, or for his descent into madness to be convincing. another crucial cut is the scene where malcolm tests macduff, and macduff learns of the murder of his family. this robs his revenge of most of its emotional force - and the character of a lot of the screen time. he's a virtual stranger when he turns up to kill macbeth.a point for trying. mactavish's banquo earns another. the first few minutes garners another. but that's all. from then on it's sound and fury blah blah blah.

this film, had it been done properly, has so much potential. parody films are always funny, and people tend to like them because they're light hearted, stupid and silly but fun. this film was funny in some parts, but it could have been a lot funnier. the acting itself was ok from all the actors, but...i wasn't satisfied. it seemed a tad empty, and my summary title says it all about the effects. proper green screens weren't used for this movie...backgrounds were added in after which just looked terrible. no wonder this film went straight to dvd lol. it wasn't all a total loss, it is funny and will give you a good laugh (at it, not with it most of the time).

except for the appearance of talented austin powers impersonator richard halpern, this pic was your run of the mill movie spoof. dated movie references will not help audiences that may come across this endeavor in future. watch for "groovy" austin powers in the hot tub. it's a hoot and a half.poor special effects are overcome by the appearance of numerous starlets in skimpy outfits, so at least that should keep one entertained (if that's what thrills you).for my money, i would rent the dvd of classic spoofs such as "airplane" or "lobster man from mars".

this is a film that revolves around two mysteries (which i have now demystifed).first, did the film makers understand the concept of 'parody' before using it to carpet bomb the audience throughout the film? parody is when a reproduction attempts to mock, comment on, or pay homage through self-depreciating humour to, the original work. in other words, there should be reasons to parody such work, and they should definitely be clever. i didn't see any of those in the film. i did see some awful 10 seconds jokes that fell flat within 2 seconds of delivery. bryan stoller probably went to eric roberts and said "hey, i was drunk last night, watching survivors, and had this brain fart for a straight to dvd release. i want you on board without reading the script...because i plan to direct this film without one!" and herein lies the second mystery: eric robert's career. i use to think eric roberts had the career he had because he was unlucky. now i realize it's because he is stupid (and therefore deserves the career that he had). after watching this movie, it is apparent that he would have been better off had he gone into mainstream adult films, which has higher budgets, more...intense...scenes and roles, better acting and direction, more elaborate and compelling plot lines, and a much wider audience than this b-movie reject (c-movie?).

there was a time when michael jackson was revered as the king of pop. then came a time when he attracted negative publicity as much as lemonade attracts wasps. finally, it is now the time that we feel truly sorry for this man.this 'movie' is another reason to. i promised a rabid michael jackson fan to watch it with her. you know the type of fan -- someone who tells him- or herself to like everything the object of affection ever did. while watching this movie, which she had seen twice already, i realized how far this fandom goes. probably far enough to rate this movie above a 1/10, as some people miraculously did.the movie attempts to be a parody of many other movies and series, most notably cast away, lost and jurassic park. unfortunately, it fails miserably at any level. the acting does not save the absolutely horrible story, the filming has the quality of a too-often played video tape, the special effects were better executed in be kind rewind (for those who do not now this movie: with aluminum foil)... all this would be funny if the movie managed to be, well, funny. unfortunately, it is not. it hurts to watch this.and then there is michael jacksons appearance in this garbage. he appears on a projection screen to deliver an important message, and manages to come across as mobile as jabba the hutt and as serious as a 4-year old. just when i thought "who is the terrible person that lured this poor man into participating in this movie and yet again making a total fool of himself", i (finally) reached the ending credits and discovered that the movie was actually partially shot at jackson's neverland ranch. in other words: he. likes. it.this movie, and jackson's involvement in it, is truly disturbing. do not watch it even for the "haha, a movie in the imdb bottom 100" effect. or be warned.

as an indie filmmaker, i try to at least make a decent film . this piece of ____ was beyond low budget. it was shot on video and not 24p mini-dv at least. the look and feel of this was just baaaad. i met the director a few years ago at showbiz expo in la and he was talking about that book, film-making for dummies that he was putting together. i thought this little video was going to be something but i guess i was wrong. he could have brought the value up a little by shooting 16mm film instead of that awful video. the plot was stupid as well as the acting and all the fake green screen and sound and the whole nine yards. i had a choice tonight to rent any movie and made the wrong choice. damn!!!!! i did buy joyride which was a hell of a movie. maybe the director should read real motion picture books on film-making and not try to cut corners when trying to make a low budget flick. maybe he should learn from the masters who made, night of the living dead and the evil dead and chain saw massacre. just to name a few of the all time low budget great hits. this is one video that should have stayed dead. i cannot call it a film because he did not use film.

holy sweet murder this is quite possibly the least funny movie i've ever seen. you can take my word for this as truth because it's playing on television right now. it's really one of the most pathetic productions i've ever seen. there is not a single redeemable aspect of this flick. it just lacks any humor whatsoever. the only good thing it possibly has going for it is that it's so unfunny that it's wholly unmemorable. in fact, i just sat through some ridiculous sub-plot and i can't really tell you what went on. the only reason i can even possibly remember having seen this movie is because it's so absolutely humorless it will stick in my mind forever based on that alone.an absolutely must miss. if your friend wants to show it to you, shoot him and save yourself the boredom.

i recently waisted 8  by going and see this movie in the cinema. it was a waste of time and the only feeling you get going out of the theater is a slightly nauseous of all the disgusting social pornography. it could have been interesting if it had a quite absurd twist but it hadn't so it was just plain awful with maybe one or two scenes which could have been taken out and made to very nice short movies.another thing i thought about is the way the director uses all the finish stereotypes as characters. it is quite extraordinary how you as a finish director can make a movie with the worst stereotypes of your own nationality. it was sad to sit and and hear the audience sitting and laughing at things that they thought was typical finish but in general just is making fun of people.

if this is what's best in the finnish cinema at the moment, i'd say those big tax euros spent at supporting "culture" have gone to waste here in a horrible way. paha maa is the worst kind of example of trying to make a finnish "european film" for big audiences. i'm sure they wanted it to be all state-of-the-art, smart and touching at the same time. the result is crap.to make it short: - the story is pretentious, naïve and not credible. the same goes for the characters. i can imagine them brainstorming about making a film where "everything would, like, turn to ***t and people would be hurt and feel, you know, really bad inside, because finnish people are so notoriously depressed, too, and their self-esteem is so bad", which brings us to the fact that...- the film is loaded with clichés, mostly about "the finnish mentality". the way the it deals with people's problems and their causes could be straight out of a regular women's magazine or a cheap bull-psychology-self-help book. ("we feel so bad inside!") i'm sure they watched some kaurismäki, too, to find out what it is about his films that people like, misunderstood him completely, and came up with a boring, depressing story about people going through all kinds of s**t for no other artistic purpose than perhaps social pornography. it's a crying shame they threw in tolstoy here. it's just a sign of trying to be smart. and of not being.- i think the worst fault, however, is the complete lack of vision and depth. the film is highly unoriginal. it is also frustrating to watch endless sulking and suffering without any real revelation brought to it. i can go through this kind of mind**ck if the film is funny or ends up being an elaborate joke, or better yet, something sublime like in e.g. von trier's breaking the waves. there was none these in paha maa. actually though, i did start laughing at some point because the turn of events was again just too predictable, over-the-top and incredible.who does this crap? and who likes it? i hope they're pretending.

let's see. this movie is many things to different people. to finns, as shown by the comments, it can be ok or dreadful or boring. to other folks, it can be something different. first off: if you do not speak finnish (i do), you will understand half of what is going on, as subtitles are dreadful and even the title is translated incorrectly ("paha maa" would probably be idiomatically translated as badlands in uk english).why did i not like it? because it is a tarantino-style movie: it simply takes a very harsh reality and throws it back at you, as brutally as possible. i, however, am not american, and thus i am not particularly fond of this proceeding, because all it does is show that the director has really nothing new to say. technical prowess (camera work is brilliant), script (not that unoriginal) do not rescue this movie from the bottom where it belongs. should you wish to see a finnish movie, then go for any of the kaurismäki brothers' movie, who match talent and directorial skill, with very good actresses and actors. this director ought to review his intention and priorities: none was intelligible, and thus this film failed. by not watching it you won't miss much.

to be fair, it has been several years since i watched the bile committed to celluloid known as "here on earth," so forgive me if my memory of the film is a little sketchy. i'll stick with the main points which plague the soul of the unfortunate viewer.scene one: chris klein, after having been thrown out of prep school (because he looks like a seventeen year old--yes, very believable), gives what i assume is his valedictorian speech...to a field. let me repeat that for you--a field. i think we're supposed to be moved by the combination of shame and eloquence he is failing to express. klein has the delivery and facial expressions of a cardboard cutout. he is a decent looking piece of cardboard, but little more.scene two: after some joyriding and teenage pyromaniac hijinks, chris klein and josh hartnett do some damage to the local diner, of which he is forced to rebuild. of course. because who better to help with construction than some random moron who crashed into it/ burned it in the first place. better yet, let's have said random moron move in on josh hartnett's girl, miss sobeski, the girl he fancies for...her equally wooden line delivery? scene three: chris klein's character is making out with leelee sobeski's character and decides to name her various body parts after the states on the eastern seaboard. my soul weeps. really, how can this scenario turn out well? surely you must alienate several million people if you imply their home is equivalent to miss sobeski's more...erm...feminine areas. secondly, naming her breasts after new york and new jersey prompts some confusion as to whether miss sobeski is actually freakishly disproportionate.scene four: leelee is running. she falls down. this gives her...knee cancer. "we always knew it could come back," her father(?) says. right. knee cancer. from tripping. perhaps i missed something. as i said, it's been a few years. surely i missed something. didn't i? for the love of god, please tell me the girl did not contract knee cancer from falling down. that scream you just heard was my soul dying.

i watched this movie to see the direction one of the most promising young talents in movies was going. unfortunately, with this movie, leelee sobieski has chosen a path not only well worn, but completely free of any meaningful destination. this movie used every hackneyed trick in the book to leave the screen, tap you on the shoulder and politely ask if it can have your heartstrings so that it may give them a good tug. romance can be done well, and when it is, the viewer is left feeling the love portrayed on screen. during the emotional climax of this movie, i laughed. heartily. to save you the time and money, i would suggest, instead of seeing this movie, you have a meal of karo syrup and velveeta. it's about the same.

..that separate good, memorable movies from movies like this. its not entertaining, touching, funny, interesting and at times feels a little sub-human. the principals act like they are other-worldly, in the worse way, when they are supposed to be relating to each other and the audience. starts out conventionally enough. rich kid gets new car for graduation but the dean says he can't have the car until after the ceremony. goes joy-riding nonetheless, and stops in the diner on the wrong side of the tracks for a quick argument with the local yokels. wise-asses the waitress/girlfriend of the head yokel. shockingly, they play chicken until they accidentally burn down the diner they left three minutes earlier (aren't all diners five feet from the gas station?).they told they have to pay the price in court, so the only reason to get this 'fish out of water' to stay in town is to come up with the scenario that both boys have to assist in the rebuilding of the diner. worse than that, the rich kid in staying with the family of the un-rich kid..in the room above the attic. that 'room above the attic' has rescued many a person in need of a bed..rich kid inexplicably is treated well by the girlfriend, who never mentions to him that he nearly killed her. this does not bode well, of course, with her boyfriend, and is never fully explained. you don't know why sam (leelee sobieski) falls for kelley (chris klein), or why jasper (josh hartnett) allows it. chris klein is tolerable, leelee completely intolerable, and josh does not register much of an impression. the character with the most life is the judge that sentences kelley and jasper to help re-build the diner. she gets off at least one funny remark, which is more than anyone else does. everyone is so morose and humorless that you will feel a little sill if you even think of smiling while the movie is on. the ending is one way to end the piece, not the most original, but at least it was over. i don't enjoy trashing a movie that some little girl somewhere in the world might really love, but since i am not one, i have to. the nicest thing i can say about this movie is that its not mean-spirited, and although it fails to compel, its innocence and home-spun, corny dialogue comes from a nice place. 4/10.

warning!! this review may contain spoilers. the back of the box is misleading. it says all this crap about kids telling ghost stories, which they do, but then it implies that they will all be killed by some killer in the woods. this doesn't happen. the stories they tell are a little interesting, specifically the one with the dog and all that licking, but most are rather boring, monsters in the woods, some mute girl, and the main one, the whole movie.

the movie had an interesting surprise. somewhat psychologically gripping. and the makers could have ended it tastefully without making it just another of a rash of movies put out by hollywood promoting homosexuality and/or other sexual deviances. this could have ended with a "pay-off", but there were other motives behind the pen. what torques me off is that the mud slung in your face after you've seen the whole movie. like the disappointing "the talented mr. ripley". yeah sure, i'm just another puritan. this gay content tarnished the whole film. i wouldn't positively judge a movie for artistic or entertainment value if its sole purpose was to promote an ulterior political motivation, more so for this.

this is really bad, the characters were bland, the story was boring, and there is no sex scene. furthermore, it lacks drama, the conflict is minimal causing it to be extremely slow paced. nothing happens in this film, you would expect a sex scene, but they just have a kiss. the plot revolves around three characters, a man, his wife, and a stranger that they pick up from the high way. the couple invite the stranger to stay with them, because he is homeless. at this point you would expect the stranger to have sex with the wife right? no they just kiss and thats it. also, this film contains no action, no comedy, no drama, and not even suspense. makes you think that maybe the studio did not even read this script!!!!

it is easy for a movie that tries to be suspenseful to wind up being merely uninteresting. it happens quite often. not only is dark harbor uninteresting, but it is very poorly done. scene after scene is tacked on to an otherwise overdone premise. a troubled couple picks up a troubled stranger only to find more trouble.some movies build tension by building the story. dark harbor keeps adding on to its story but never building upon it. i was hoping that like other movies, the suspense would finally explode. it never does. also, the characters have no continuity from scene to scene. they may act one way in one scene, but then act a completely different way in another scene. at first, you think that they are merely out of character, but by the end you realize that they are not really characters at all. they are just props for the final twist. the final ten minutes try to be shocking. instead, it's rather lame and uninteresting. the only thing that was shocking to me was that the movie finally ended. at less than ninety minutes the movie still feels way too long.this isn't one of those low-budget gems. it's more like a counterfeit watch that breaks as soon as you take it home.

this is a classic b type movie that you'd rather not waste your time and see. it started well and i thought it will grow up as a good thriller, but i was mistaking. all movie long you get the feeling that soon something interesting will take place and it will suddenly turn into a tensed thriller, but that doesn't happen. it runs slowly and peacefully til the end, with nothing interesting in it. just the ending was unexpected and original, but that's it. vote: 2.5 out of 10. oh, one more thing. why is this movie rated r anyway???

the wind. easily one of the worst films ever made. the only good that comes from this kind of pointless drivel, is the fact that seeing films like this get distribution makes indy horror filmmakers like me confident that my upcoming feature will make the cut too. i mean, if this represents the market for indy horror, i could make a fortune videotaping myself taking out the garbage for 83 minutes. a complete list of what this film lacks would take way too long to write out. but, the highlites are: no story, terrible acting, awful cinematography, and virtually no editing. that last one bothered me the most. as an editor myself, this film drove me absolutely crazy because it had almost no editing at all. every scene was shot in a master. they had absolutely no coverage at all. for anyone who doesn't know..."coverage" is shooting a scene from multiple angles to have cutting options when editing to make for a desirable viewing experience. yeah, this movie had none of that. i'm talking about even the simplest of scenes. example: an ordinary conversation scene between two people sitting at a table would typically start out with a master establishing who's in the scene and where they are. then, as the conversation goes on, you would cut back and forth to over-the-shoulder shots as the conversation continues. you may even throw in a cutaway shot or two of something on the table, or in someone's hand. anything. this is "film 101" stuff guys. it seems as though these people had no idea this is how films work. every shot was a camera lock-down. no movement, no cutting, no nothing. if i was teaching a course in filmmaking, this would be the visual aid for my "what not to do" lesson.in closing, don't waste your time folks. the only amazing this about this film is that it ever scored distribution at all. 

alright this movie might have been good if there was a plot behind it. the title didn't even fit the it after the first ten minutes. the wind didn't have a whole lot to do with the rest of the movie. the acting was sub-par and the writing reminded me of something you would read in a children's book of scary stories. as far as horror movies go this shouldn't even be classified as one. this was a disgrace to horror and thriller fans everywhere. i hate to be so harsh but i felt i want the time i spent watching this movie back. hopefully there will not be a follow up to this. this movie should be locked in a vault and never released to the public for viewing.

ok, i wanted to see this because it had a few good reviews, but this movie was awful... just plain awful. the characters were 1 dimensional and nothing the actors could do could ever breathe any life into them. the story was abysmal... the wind stopped becoming a plot device halfway through... it just completely becomes forgotten. the visuals while were cool were sooooo drawn out... 5 minutes of a guy crawling on the ground, 3 minutes of a girl putting on her makeup. i don't know what this guy is trying to pull off... it's like he had no plot no dialog and the movie needed to run just so long so lets not edit scenes at all... foreign films are great for creating a story without using a lot of dialog, this movie makes me think that there is no way american cinema can ever do this. i want to give up watching movies altogether... bad bad movie!

somewhere in usa, the young clair manipulates her friends mic, billy and john, showing a letter that would be sent by bob to her and the group cowardly beats bob and mic kills him with a piece of wood in the forest. mic feels sorrow and decides to tell his mother what he did, but john and billy threaten him, with tragic consequences.i believe "the wind" is the worst movie i have ever seen in my life. the awful screenplay is ridiculous, and it is almost impossible to write a summary, since there is no story or plot, only sequences of disconnected scenes. the amateurish direction and acting are amazingly poor and terrible. it is unbelievable how producers invest money in such garbage, distributors release this crap worldwide and viewers like me buy this dvd. i waited until the very last scene because i was curious to see how bad this film could be and i was impressed, since it is worse than i could imagine in my lowest expectations. in the end, i question why imdb does not offer zero in the vote system, since the garbage really deserves this vote. my vote is one.title (brazil): "força invisível" ("invisible force")

upon renting this, i wasn't expecting to be blown away. in fact, i knew it was going to be horrible. it was just seeing how horrible it really was. that's what comes with low budget horror."snakes on a train", not to be confused with the serpentine summer blockbuster "snakes on a plane" with samuel l. jackson, is about a woman who is put under a mayan curse that causes snakes to hatch inside her and devour her from within. her only hope of surviving lies in a shaman that lives across the border, so she and her companion stowaway onto a train bound for los angelas. throw in a few passengers and hilarity ensues.come to think of it, though, the story isn't half bad. isn't half good, either.the acting in this film rivals that of a sci-fi original, if not worse. trust me, it's horrible. the snakes were another problem. they were supposed to be rattlers, i guess, but most of what you get instead are mostly harmless garden snakes that don't attack anything and there's this rattling sound effect that gets really annoying.the gore effects on the other hand, while not on the tom savini level, were actually pretty good.and another thing, the ending alone makes up for the rest of the movie. i'm not going to talk about it here, so you'll have to rent this and see for yourself.

snakes on a train starts as mexican couple brujo (a.j. castro) & alma (julia ruiz) cross the boarder into the us, they then illegally board a seventeen hour train to los angeles. however alma's family didn't approve of her & brujo's relationship & placed an ancient black magic curse on her that turns all her insides into snakes, ain't life a b*tch? as the snakes pour out of alma's mouth & slither away to other parts of the train they begin to infect the other passengers with the same unusual ailment...edited & directed by the mallachi brothers (although the imdb claims it's just one guy using a pseudonym, peter mervis) one has to say that i thought snakes on a train was crap, it's as simple as that really. it seems the entire film was set-up & made to cash in on the samuel l. jackson cult flick snakes on a plane (2006) by every horror fans least favourite production company the asylum who specialise in ripping-off big budget hollywood flicks & that style of money & film-making is no more evident than here with snakes on a train, making a film just because the title rhymes with a more successful film is not a good starting point. the script by eric forsberg is rubbish, for a start snakes on a plane was great fun whereas snakes on a train is a lot more serious & when you actually break it down & look at it this should have been much more light hearted. in fact it probably would have worked better as an scary movie (2000) type spoof. you know something, i am struggling to find one positive thing to say about snakes on a train it's that bad. for a start the character's are rubbish & it's impossible to emote with anyone, the story is downright awful & makes no sense (if people spew all those small snakes up where did the huge ones come from? why did alma turn into the giant snake at the end? why did bujo kill the train driver? how was he going to stop the train once it reached los angeles? where did that typhoon come from at the end?), it takes itself far too seriously, the first seventy odd minutes is so boring & uneventful i am surprised i stayed awake & it's just a very, very poor film on just about every level.director mervis only has a few train carriage car sets which all look pretty much alike so the film becomes very repetitive & dull to watch. there's barely any blood or gore, there are some snakes borrowing under a few peoples skin, someone gets shot & that's about it. the special effects are rubbish too, the giant cgi snake at the end is truly awful & the least said about it the better. it's not scary, there's zero atmosphere & it's a bit of a bore from start to finish. the real live snakes are a problem too, they are just so docile & nonthreatening. if you look at any scene featuring a real snake & an actor the snakes never make any move towards them or act aggressively & in fact always appear to want to slither away in the opposite direction.shot in california technically the film is obviously low budget & it show's, basically it looks cheap because it is. the acting isn't great not that the actor's are given any sort of material to work with.snakes on a train is rubbish, i am sorry but that's how i feel & i don't quite know how else to describe it. i really can't see what anyone would get out of watching snakes on a train, it really is that bad.

there are spoilers but trust me, i'm doing you a favor.my friends and i like to watch crappy movies every so often. inspired by mystery science theater and our knack for on the spot jokes; we set out to find movies worth watching that are in fact...not worth watching. however trouble comes into paradise when these movies can only be found if you buy them. and i am a firm believer in not giving one cent to such a group of talentless scumbags. so, as another reviewer has said, films like this are a reason why downloading movies for free should be legalized. i prefer the idea of; instead of straight to video you have straight to internet. that way the ass-bags who made this travesty won't ever turn a profit. which unfortunately you know they do. they hire a bunch of actors who can't act, special effects from a high school classroom, rubber snakes you can get at the dollar store, constant vomiting of green jell-o, and the two main characters who seem to switch between being border jumping mexicans who only speak spanish, to arabs to being 100% fluent in english, random nudity, a guy being shot like 10 times including one to the side of the head and living and the most retarded ending in the history of film, book, cave drawings and hustler magazine. the fact that i actually predicted that the jell-o puking snake girl would actually transform into a snake about half way through terrifies me...anyways, the movie is great to make fun of, but you have to make sure there's at least 4 of you and you're all spitting out jokes in rapid fire, because if there's even 1 second of watching this movie where you're not laughing your ass off, you will feel physically ill. i kid you not. my friends and i were eating chicken wings and now i can't even look at such a thing anymore without being reminded of this piece of sh!t.this film is one above alien vs. hunter which is by far the second worst movie ever made. and i've seen lots of bad movies. incidentally, it's the same production company as this film and that bald guy is in both as well. just thought you might like to know that little fun fact. -100 out 0f 10.

oh. good. grief.i saw this movie title in the tv schedules and thought "i must watch this movie, ripping off snakes on a plane, it will be terrible but hopefully laughable too. sounds fantastically bad". well, i was half right.this movie is eye-meltingly bad and, sadly, not even unintentionally hilarious. it's just bad. even worse, it takes almost an hour to get to anything resembling action. for the first half of the movie we have to endure some mumbled foreign language (mexican or spanish, apologies for my ignorance) and terrible acting as some woman vomits up live snakes for reasons we only find out later on. then we have to endure even more terrible acting, and we find out that those mumbling in the foreign language could speak english anyway, as the snakes finally get loose on the train and things move from the sedate to the ridiculous.low-budget does not always mean "bad" but, in this case, it does. what we have here is a movie given no thought, a terrible script, a bad cast and not even the sense to capitalise on it's very few strengths. i give two marks for a few decent special effects and a whacky ending but that still feels a bit too generous. avoid if you can.see this if you like: stagknight, the wicker man remake, terrible cgi.

my take: typically routine and lazy straight to video attempt from disney. disney must have fallen in love with the family movie tradition that is the family dog. many movies have devoted themselves with stories that solely center themselves with man's best friend. disney themselves have made a handful. they also made a handful of those that are literally dogs. add this one to that bunch.i haven't seen the original for a very long time, so probably i'm not the right person to judge if this straight-to-video sequel fares any better. anyone above the age of seven aren't the right people to see it either. perhaps only the youngest of the young will want to see lady and the tramp ii: scamp's adventure, and even they would grow up and say it wasn't the best kind of family entertainment they have ever seen. i guess to be fair, i can say is that it warrants a rental, but that ain't much to say.this sequel pretty much picks up the parts left behind after the original oft-called classic. lady and tramp now have a litter of cute crocker spaniel pups... and one mischievous mongrel named scamp who is a chip off the old block. instead of the confines of home, scamp wishes to run off with the other junkyard dogs of town, unknown of his dad's own past as one of those mongrels of the streets. to capture the charms of the original, this one throws in the same poor dog/rich dog love story, in vice-versa. scamp falls for a one of the junkyard dogs named angel (and who wouldn't with a name like that and a voice that sounds like alyssa milano?). que replay of the famous spaghetti scene! other than the "cute" factor, there is nothing in store for any audience in this lazy straight-to-video effort. stick with the original.rating: ** out of 5.

i rented this movie, knowing that it would be bad (i have only seen one good disney sequel and that was toy story 2), but it went far lower than my expectations. i am a die hard disney fan and i just don't believe in sequels with disney movies. for somebody who didn't grow up with the classics (either watching them when they came out, or renting them since you were born) it's a cute story. i just feel that the plot was dragged out a little too much, and was to predictable. the one thing that annoyed me the most was the voices of the girl children of lady and tramp. they were too high pitched. although most reviews say that it isn't that bad, i think that if you are a true disney fan, you shouldn't waste your time with this one.hopefully disney won't be making any more sequels to any of the other classics any time soon.

if regarded as an independent feature i can't say it's too bad at all but from where i'm standing this sequel and the original "lady and the tramp" don't agree with each other! they are two completely different movies with different style, different voice personalities, different narratives and about the only thing that they share with each other is the visuals (e.g. the town-house of jim dear, darling, lady and tramp) and none of those have changed.if you're seeking any kind of continuity years after the release of the original for those memorable songs like "bella notte" and "the siamesse cats song" this sequel won't give you any at all! just about every song has a little pop to it and those good old characters like jock and trusty, jim dear and darling and aunt sarah and her cats may well be seen but they're seeming to be somehow replaced by new characters, not to mention peg not appearing at all, whose voices are quite annoying. even lady and tramp don't appear often enough and as for scamp?! he is so spoilt! and treats his father tramp with utter disrespect, then runs away with no remorse even after hearing how much he's being missed at home! and they called his shameless getaway an adventure! i'd say scott wolf truly brought out the abusive bad boy in scamp wiping out the typical cute disney animal. even the old characters just drive you mad in this; trusty sounds like goofy sick in bed, jock (jeff-stupid-bennett) - and his voice - sound neither scottish nor worth hearing! zap him off as far as possible to free our poor ears from his voice and as for the dumb, feather-brained, exasperating junkyard dogs!!!!!! somebody put them down!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"lady and the tramp 2" isn't completely bad if you're not already having a tough day but i expect a lot more charm from a sequel to a true classic - scamp is chavvy, so is his girlfriend angel and there is a feeble storyline. still, i think you should try it at least once because, as i say, there are much worse movies around.

at least it is with this episode. here we have a time traveler, the professor from gilligan's island, no less, going back in time to 1865. what does one do--why try to save lincoln of course! no really interesting variations are rung on this old theme. as another reviewer has stated, this episode is particularly drab and unstylish, with little to suggest that "the professor" really is back in the 1860s. budget limitations are readily apparent, and the direction is stolid. john wilkes booth adds a spark but it remains a very flat production. we too often feel we are on stage sets, waiting for something clever to happen. there is a minor twist at the end, but i emphasize minor.

this is the second addition to frank baum's personally produced trilogy of oz films. it's essentially the same childishness as in the other two pictures, although i consider it preferable to the others because it's shorter. as in the other films, there are performers in animal costumes, an adult woman pretends to be a boy, and the characters and plot jump all over the place while the camera-work is static. this time, at the centre is a magic cloak that grants wishes, and the boy played by a woman is made a king.most of the special effects are witnessed at the beginning. fairies are represented by multiple-exposure photography. and, there's a man in the moon that looks just like those made by georges méliès years before, most famously in 'le voyage dans la lune' (1902). méliès' imaginative fantasies and creative trick effects made him the leading pioneer of early cinema, and the films he made around the turn of the century were far better and even technically more advanced than this trifling oz series.

for one thing, he produced this movie. it has the feel of later movies with international casts that are dubbed. the opening credits tell us it was filmed in vienna.bey was a delight in the universal adventure movies of the 1940s. he was also superb in a movie i saw maybe ten years ago but have never heard of since: "the amazing mr. x." maybe it was dr. x. i remember it as a thrilling and frightening movie.this one is pretty wooden, unfortunately. the plot isn't easy to follow. when i got the hang of it, i was disappointed anyway.francis lederer looks great as a concert pianist. he was a very handsome leading man ten or 15 years earlier. he never really caught on as a major star, though he should have.this isn't terrible but it's pretty heavy going.

this is "realism"? if rivette was seeking to give us a ground-level study of a woman in a certain place and time and how she was able to influence (and was influenced by) the world around her, he has failed miserably. most prominently because we never get a clue as to why thousands of men would have followed her into battle. there is certainly not enough exposition of the cultural/historical context to define the country's need for such a savior and, god knows, there is nothing particularly charismatic about joan as she is presented here. unless bonnaire's wooden posturing and flat line readings are supposed to indicate transcendent faith and determination. the use of landscape is particularly uninspired - we never lose the feeling we are watching twentieth century actors wandering in a supposedly medieval landscape. and as for the battle scenes (which, in contrast to some commentors claims, do take up a good 15% of screentime)- they look like look like some some history club from your local high school recreating a medieval siege, although the kids would no doubt put more passion into it. i will give rivette credit, however, for picturing a side of joan left out by other movies: that of a petulant, naive, and narcissistic adolescent (played by a woman all too clearly at least twice the age of the character she is supposed to portray) obviously unable to understand her place within the movement she is helping to create or the world existing outside her own passions. joan's outrage at her own soldiers swearing and astonishment at the enemy for their lack of respect and obedience to her are jarringly spontaneous and believable notes (you suddenly realize such moments must naturally have occurred)in an otherwise uninvolving historical "representation". unfortunately they also serve to point out precisely what is not addressed on screen -what made joan special? i must say i also continued to be puzzled and frustrated by certain foreign film lovers who equate tedium and lack of dramatic involvement with "artistry" and "seriousness". does this film really increase our understanding or involvement with the subject? or with anything for that matter? 4/10.

i went to see the movie because my boyfriend was raving about how much he wanted to see it, and how his friends had already been and loved it. so i came in with a neutral attitude, not really expecting the worst. unfortunately, that is what i got. i could write a 15 page paper on why this is easily the worst movie i have ever seen. but for your benefit i will point out the pros and the endless supply of cons. to begin, the acting was very good, especially christopher waltz and melanie laurent. there were also a few lines that deserved a laugh, and a couple suspenseful scenes. sadly, good acting, a little humor and suspense is where the good points end. the whole beginning story could have been great. a jewish girl's family is butchered, she goes into hiding, later encounters the man responsible for her pain and then hatches a great plan for revenge. sounds very good. but the movie wouldn't be quite as "satisfying" for the americans and jews craving nazi blood. i have no problem with wwii movies or killing nazis; i saw defiance and like it very much. however, it's the way and attitude with which our would-be heroes kill. i'll give you a prime example of the kind of hypocrisy this movie oozes. our hoodlum gang ambushes a german unit and kills/scalps all of them except a sergeant and two other soldiers (no problem so far). they ask the sergeant to divulge information on another german unit. when he "respectfully refuses" to betray the lives of his fellow soldiers they bash his head in a with a baseball bat, cheering, and swearing as if they were at a football game. they took that nazi's head off yaaayy! now let's look at the hypocrisy in that scene. here's a hypothetical situation: a group of american soldiers are ambushed and taken captive by the enemy. the same scenario follows and the american commanding officer would rather die than betray his fellow soldier. the enemy bashes his head in with much celebration. this would infuriate an audience if this scene were in a movie. that american soldier was a hero for placing his men above himself, and those barbarians brutally murdered him! wellwhat about the nazi sergeant? well he's a nazi and deserves to die the cruelest death possible, right? coincidentally, the nazi's felt the same towards the jews. see the hypocrisy? by celebrating the butcher of the nazis we are placing ourselves on the same sadistic level. major hypocrisy #2: the nazis make a propaganda movie about a german sniper who kills nearly 300 american soldiers. near the end of the movie, the film is revealed. hitler and his cohorts giggle with delight as they watch an american soldier get shot out of a window and fall into a fountain. the nazis cheer as soldier after soldier falls to the snipers skill. this is supposed to enrage the american viewers of this scene. those evil nazis are laughing over the deaths of our brave men! well the irony is, isn't that what we were doing (or supposed to be doing) the entire time we're watching inglorious basterds? laughing over the pain of others simply because they were "the bad guys." how would we feel if native americans somehow made a hit film in which they reek bloody vengeance on the american settlers? or what if blacks made a movie glorifying the nat turner rebellion? ok enough about the hypocritical flaws. i'll summarize other reasons for the 1 star rating. 1) there were view admirable characters throughout the movie. brad pitt even tortures a woman by sticking his finger in her gunshot wound because he suspects she betrayed him. he's the good guy? 2) scenes dragged on way longer than they needed to. 3) brad pitt's southern, supposedly tennessee accent is horrible and thoroughly annoying throughout the entire move. i'll quit now since i'm at 700 words. unfortunately it seems that the general population doesn't think anymore, they just want blood. and that is why this movie received such a high ranking. i recommend this movie for the ignorant or if you are jewish and simply wanting to see a nice "fantasy justice." personally, when i finally got out of the movie theater i felt like i had been scalped (or wish that i had so i wouldn't have suffered over 2 hours of mental rape).

inglourious basterds is tarantino's worst film he has ever made. it's full of his usual ingredient's i.e. snappy dialogue, brutal and sudden violence, but it all feel's deja-vu. the directing is typical tarantino and nothing seem's new at all. it's almost as if he's copied exactly from his only masterpiece, pulp fiction. there is nothing new or exciting about inglourious basterds to be honest, it's just a war drama that isn't funny, nor brilliant as pulp fiction was. basterds supposedly is tarantino's tribute to leone's spaghetti western's but seem's mis-jointed and out of place especially with the continuing use of big sub-titles and throw's the audience of balance.

little quentin seems to have mastered the art of having the cake and eating it.as usual, the pure sadistic display can be explained as a clever thought-provoking way of sending violence back into the audience's face.sure, mr tarantino. violence is baaad. sadism is baaad. it is well worth wading in it to make that point. how very brilliant.the juvenile part of the audience may well not be clever enough to follow all the smart references to higher levels of consciousness though, but i'm confident they'll see the light one day.thanks for making this little world of ours a little better. you deserve a medal.

chapter one: once upon a time at a table (1941)in which a german nazi and a french dairy farmer talk at a table for 20 minutes; first in french, then in english.chapter two: three years of inglorious basterds in sixteen minutes... without tables (mostly)in which an american lieutenant talks to his newly formed 8 man jewish- american commando unit. there are no tables present. cut to adolf hitler, three years later. he is angry at his men's inability to deal with the basterds. hitler does have a table. we return to the basterds in a flashback. again, distinct lack of table-based content. chapter three: german night in paris... at a table... talkingin which a jewish woman who escaped from under the table in chapter one has somehow managed to become the proprietress of a cinema. the jewish woman talks to an actor at a table in a bar. later, the jewish woman, the actor, joseph goebbels and a translator talk at a table in a restaurant. the actor and goebbels talk in german. the translator translates the german into french. the jewish woman replies in french. the translator translates the french into german. goebbels decides to hold a film premiere at the jewish woman's cinema. the actor and goebbels leave. the nazi (who talked with the dairy farmer at a table for twenty minutes back in chapter one) arrives. he talks with the jewish woman at the table. he leaves. the jewish woman breaks down; overcome with emotion at having spent so long talking at a table. chapter four: operation table talkingin which austin powers sends a british officer to join the basterds and an actress on a mission to talk in german at a table in a tavern. after 21 minutes of talking at a table they all shoot each other. the actress survives but spends the next 5 minutes lying on a table talking.chapter five: revenge of the giant tablein which, the basterds decide to continue the operation by talking in italian and suicide bombing the cinema. the nazi takes the actress into a small room where they sit next to a table. a hoe that he found under the table in the tavern fits her so he kills her. then he takes two of the basterds to a big room, where they sit and talk at a table. meanwhile, the cinema burns down, hitler is riddled with bullets and the two basterds blow themselves up for no good reason at all.the end

i will never go to another tarantino movie again. the entire film was worthless. my wife and i both regret that we didn't get up and walk out at the first indication of what the film was really going to be about (which is still hard to determine since it was such a ridiculous storyline...blood, guts, and violence seemed to be the only real theme), but we kept hoping there'd be something redeeming just around the corner. unfortunately, there wasn't because there wasn't anything that made sense! we, along with a lot of the other people in the audience walked out of the theater muttering "that was disgusting", "what a waste of time", "i should've walked out", "where was the comedy", "that was pathetic", etc. it actually made us, the audience, voice our disgust and the feeling that we had just been thoroughly ripped off. the only thing of merit in the film was the costuming and the acting ability of almost everyone in the film....there just wasn't a plot/script worthy of their talents. i rate this a 1 because there isn't a 0. i can't quite understand how anyone could rate this higher than a 0!

i am sorry folks, but i have to say i really cannot understand the overwhelming feelings everybody gets by seeing this movie...when i saw it i looked at my watch to know how much more time i had to spend with this kindergarten nonsense.so why this verdict?first of all: the movie tells a story that doesn't deliver any excitement! it is not even the amusingly distorted reality of a quentin tarantino we used to know. this story could have come out of every little kid's head. it doesn't have anything intelligent in it, neither anything inventive and it goes on for hours... the story has appropriate content for about 30 min. the rest is just awfully enhanced scenes that are supposed to leave a somewhat cool image. doesn't work. even the previously seen cutbacks that tarantino often uses just confuse and are not in any way cool. second: some guys go to germany and kill nazis. ah really? do they? the only nazis they killed were a handful of guys, one of them being man enough to rather die than betray his companions. is this the ugly face tarantino wanted to give the nazis? a brave soldier that is more valiant than any of the "basterds"? certainly not --> fail and what happens to the terrible nazi-killing basterds? well they all get killed by nazis except two who are taken hostages --> wow, what terrible revengeful monsters they are...third: any characters? yes one! the only role and the only gleam of hope for the entire movie is chritoph waltz who is building a truly deep and very detailed character here. great acting! brad pitt really sucks and is completely out-acted by waltz. never seen a such a weak performance by pitt... and the rest? well, some germans you've never seen before and will never see after. when the movie started and i saw the group of the seven basterds i hoped to see something like the "magnificent seven": a group of extraordinary guys, each one with a distinct character, making their way to their destiny fearless and knowing... i was then very disappointed, when i saw the "inglourious basterds". no details at all, no characters, no real men, just some random guys you won't remember who were not given any chance to differentiate themselves... but in fact you don't even need to differentiate, cause the "inglourious basterds" except pitt hardly play any role in this movie...so i was really disappointed, and seeing this movie on place #40 of the greatest movies of all time is the only thing about this, that leaves me with my mouth opened...

i deliberately did not read any reviews of this movie on imdb before i watched it because i really wanted to see it and make up my own mind. i have been a big fan of qt in the past, i think we can all agree he has made some great movies, but lately he seems to have been overcome by his own mystique and disappeared up his own fundament. this "movie" proves that. it consists of few scenes of the basterds at work. it consists instead mostly of long, tedious, boring stretches of conversation between people that, after a while, you realise you just do not give a stuff about. it's longwinded and lacks any of the great sparkling dialogue that qt has been responsible for in the past. the entire movie is anticlimactic. there is no tension - what is going to happen in every scene is telegraphed so clearly in advance that by the time it happens you just don't care. honestly folks, don't believe the hype. this is a very boring movie and you will be missing nothing if you don't see it.

previous tarantino movies were from a guy in love with other movies. this one is from a guy in love with his own writing. it isn't inglorious, its disgusting.i absolutely hated inglorious basterds. the entire point of a film is to entertain - if u call bashing people's heads and removing their scalps entertaining!!!! - and if there is one unforgivable sin a movie can commit, it is extreme boredom or disgust.the movie is just a collection of endless and excruciatingly boring and disgusting scenes of people talking at tables in various languages. there is even one scene where 3 people talk for nearly 45 minutes at the same table, before, thankfully they are all shot. i wished they would have been killed off after 5 minutes. even woody allen knows when to shut the f**k up.this table talk style is a tarantino hallmark, but in other films, i actually cared about what they were saying and the people who were talking. here, i couldn't care less. all of quentin's films display an enormous confidence, particularly jackie brown. but here there is a pervasive feeling in every scene, tarantino had no idea where he was going with the film.is it violent? sure there's torture and scalping galore, but you'd have to remind me. thankfully, the film was so thin, i didn't even remember i had seen it earlier in the day when until i saw a review headline on msnbc.he's out of gimmicks and apparently dying to write a novel. but do us a favor qt and spare us the movie.i walked out of this movie halfway through and i would never recommend anyone seeing it no matter what a die-hard quarantino fan he or she is.i give it 0 / 10.

seriously disappointing performance by brad pitt and q t, the plot is very superficial and lame, and, unless indirectly intended, this film actually glorify the nazis and portrays them as men of honor, and show that the jewish people are deceiving, cant keep promises and bloody vicious. ((the following contains spoiler)) hitler together with the most notorious nazis are attending a stupid plot less movie about the killing of 300 italian soldiers in a small cinema theater in paris is unbelievably ridiculous. the nazis laughing and hooraying each killing in the movie as if watching a basketball game stupid, the deal at the end is lame. whats really appalling is that the movie earned great reviews and is ranked here in the 40s amongst the greatest 250 films. will not be surprised if it harvested many awards, including oscars, as well. the movie is simply a kissing ass to the jewish people, but hey reconsider, its not even doing a great job doing that. it truly dwarfed the whole nazi - jews conflict and a pure insult to all who fought and suffered from the tyranny of the nazis.

ugh. unfortunately this is one of the worst movies i've seen in a long time. none of the characters are remotely likable, which makes this film difficult to watch. they're all miserable thirty year olds who don't take responsibility for their crummy lives. i was only able to make it through a half hour of the film, so there's a chance things got better afterward, but i doubt it. i can't imagine five people as self-absorbed as they are would manage to remain friends with each other for ten years.three sex scenes in the first half hour were also disappointing, as they had no relevance to the plot, and were clearly a gratuitous (failed) attempt to bring some life to this otherwise dull film.save your time and money, and skip this movie.

synopsis correction: the ending does not show ben cruising online for guys. he is looking up arabic language courses at the presido military acadamy in san francisco. perhaps to join the war in iraq as a translator, (fyi- many of the dishonorable discharges from "d'ont ask d'ont tell have been translators (they are now it major short supply) ben also spoke russian. this movie is a good time capsule of life in manhatten but quite a bit of non reality here. mostly a good laugh at lame social skills and the sad portrayal of "grown up" twenty somethings not developing beyond the college party mode. also a brief study of the always changing scene in manhatten.(somehow it always stays close to the edge of the same b.s.)watch together the films "englishman in new york"" and the "the new twenty" both good for nostalgia. i think the movie "twenty" shows how far the blur between gay and straight as evolved.these two films are gay time travel for sure!!!!enjoy

talk about marketing. the poster/home video cover of 'the new twenty' broadcasts a half-naked male in a "wolfe video." for those familiar with the gay-themed movies  this broadcasts a "must-see." (i loved reading one reviewer (from another site) stating they had been "tricked" into seeing a "sodomite" movie. are you serious? the tagline itself as the word "gay." the lord gives you eyes, yet you cannot see) that being said, despite the number of gay characters, stereotyped, no less (see: the lonely gay, the aids victim gay and the closeted gay) it's more about long-term friendship and characters that grow apart. in fact, if anything, there's more (here's one for christians to complain about) heterosexual couples having sex outside of, gasp!, marriage. not to mention backstabbing, drinking to excess and drug usage. i see this more of a made for tv-logo or showtime movie than big screen effort. sure, i loved the cinematography, some of the actors could act and i always love seeing a big-group-of-friends that actually act like they've known each other for a million years. but we've see this all before. nothing really "new" here. barely an original idea  hence bringing back the same 'ole "i have aids, let's deal with that" for a good portion of the movie and boy, our friend has a serious drug problem, but let's not deal with that until it's almost too late. that's so (us) 'queer as folk' and 'broken hearts club,' respectfully. the film deals with a group of college buddies, now grown (in size not minds) who have to eventually grow up and each trying their best while failing. strangely, as in most of these independent movies, the most interesting, to me at least, was the heavier-set one, ben. he stole each scene, but, again, there wasn't much to take.

what we're given in this trying-to-be trendy film is a "frat-pack" of college friends, now approaching age 30 (which we all know, of course, their generation thinks of as the "new 20"). consisting of four guys and a gal, we have thrust at us the following types: seemingly "unemployeds" and frequent drug users, along with one individual who is job successful and one who is trying-to-be. they are all, in their own way, drifting while trying to find both a future and emotional happiness. with one, possibly two exceptions, these are people this reviewer would definitely never care to come close to modeling myself after. there is disappointment after disappointment after disappointment in almost all their lives. except in the instance of one individual (who appears on the way to finding it), none appears headed toward emotional satisfaction in his/her life. and so, about the only sincere moment in this film is when a knock at the door brings to the person answering it an unexpected and heartfelt "i love you."with only the exceptions mentioned, these people are the kind hardly deserving or worthy of several hundred thousands of dollars being thrown away in presenting their stories.ps--writer/director, johnson, definitely appears to have a problem with showing gay sexual scenes----with no such problems in presenting more prolonged and revealing heterosexual ones. why might that be?****

"the new twenty" is one of the worst films i have ever seen. yes, some may argue that formulaic small budget films that strive for less may seem worse, but i would argue that a pseudo-intellectual anti-formulaic "indie" film that pretends to be more is worse. "the new twenty" was written and directed by chris mason johnson, and i will never get back the 91 minutes of my life that i wasted on his film.the screenplay & charactersfrom beginning to end, the screenplay failed to provide an anti-hero or hero with a moral core that the audience would want to see succeed or fail. in story telling, the three dramatic conflicts are man vs. man, man vs. the world, and man vs. himself. the screenplay focuses on a group of college friends in new york, and is preoccupied with the dynamic of man vs. himself, where each of the film's characters are so self-absorbed in a stupor of depression and self-destructive behavior that the movie atrophies before the audiences very eyes. each of the main characters indulge in unexplained bad behavior (heroin addiction with no history as to why the character is an addict; a fiancée who has sex with her fiancée's boss/investor, even though the character is written too smart to have sex with such a sleazy character; a man who begins as a decent guy, but is attracted to a foul-mouthed investor, and converts for some unknown reason into a similar foul-mouthed business jackass; a closeted chubby gay cyber geek, who does nothing, but find dates online; and a gay asian man who dates an hiv positive older man, but has no scenes establishing why the relationship works and why love develops).crucial scenes establishing the cause of the character's addiction, the suffering and self- loathing of the fiancée that might explain why she would sleep with a sleaze bag; the back story that would explain why a decent guy would be attracted to a "gordon gecko" type character and become a jackass; a story line for the chubby cyber geek; and more scenes of interaction between the asian man and hiv positive boyfriend are all missing.without proper establishing details, all of the characters' actions seem forced and contrived.direction, cinematography & scorei found mr. johnson's direction to be without a clear point of view, leaving the actors emotionally incoherent. the cinematography can be described as mundane at best. mr. johnson selected small spaces to shoot and failed to catch the grandeur of new york city. this failure created a claustrophobic film, that viewed like the filming of a stage play, and not a film.the score was embarrassingly absent from most of the film. i assume that mr. johnson is to blame, since he could have asked for full score to enhance understanding in each shot.conclusion"the new twenty" is an annoying and unmitigated failure in film-making.

oh, man, they sure knew how to make them back then. hollywood has forgotten the basic ingredients of bad movie making: cardboard steel and the god fearing scientist action hero! this film was so close to a masterpiece, alas it was not to be, as it failed to feature ray guns and invaders from the moon. the mst3k version tried to fix this by adding a pilot of a show called captain cody, where a guy with a rocket propelled jacket fights bad make-up people from the moon, but it didn't quite add up.also, the comments of the guys in the theater were not nearly as funny as i expected them to be. all in all, a great disappointment.

there must be an error. this movie belongs with "plan 9", and a lot others as a quite entertaining, silly diversion. you'll never accept you like it, yet you will watch it whenever it comes out on tv. it's as simple as that.

mexican 'classic' was the third entry in the aztec mummy series. as you will soon find out, this movie is anything but a classic, instead, it's more like a movie that deliberately tries to bore you.some scientist wants to steal aztec treasure from a tomb, but guarding that tomb is that walking toilet paper commercial: the aztec mummy. knowing he can't beat the mummy, he then builds a robot, and a very bad one at that. we only get to see mr.robot in the last reel, as he clunks around, and does battle with the aztec mummy.i have seen a lot of lousy sci-fi films, hell most sci-fi films i see are lousy, but this one, for it's entire duration of 64 minuites, is the worst movie i've seen, with fubar coming in a close second....in conclusion: don't waste your time.

with the dialogue in the dubbed version of this film, i don't think that shakespeare is in any great danger. this is the story of an ancient aztec mummy who has been disenfranchised. his stuff has been taken and this really ticks him off. he seems to know who's doing this even though he's a gyrating, raving entity. i loved the two dull men who tell the story of how the mummy was found and the doctor who is determined to destroy the creature. there are all these scenes in this ridiculous graveyard, full of cheap crosses and other junk. there's a mausoleum where the mummy is kept. i can't begin to reproduce the idiocy of this, including a snake pit where the good doctor is thrown (there is a door next to it so he can crawl out) to the robot, a mass of metal cans with a guy inside. the dialogue is awful. there are long pauses between speeches as if someone offstage is feeding them their lines. i love the scene where the two little kids accuse their mother of going out at night (she goes into this zombie state or something). nonetheless, if your looking for a film that you can laugh at and never takes itself seriously, watch this. have a couple beers first. like a direct line from the mummy's tomb, "watch this and your eyes will bleed and your breath will stink." what more can i say?

**spoilers** the third and mercifully last of the aztec mummy trilogy in the fact that the series major star-besides the mummy- actor ramon gay, as dr. eduardo almada, was gunned down by the outraged husband of a woman he was having an affair with on may 28, 1960! still that didn't stop gay, in him being edited into them from his previous films, from being in a number of future mexican horror movies made over the next four years after his death.in "robot vs the aztec mummy" we have the once again mad scientist dr. krupp trying to get his hands on the mummy's golden breastplate and bracelet in order, by having them deciphered, to find the aztez treasure that's been secretly buried somewhere in modern mexico city over 500 years ago. "robot vs the aztec mummy" is not much as a movie in itself in that its made up of stock footage of the previous aztec mummy films that take up over half of the films running time.after getting introduced to the movie's cast members, some who have been killed in the previous aztec mummy films, we get down to the real nitty gritty in it involving the evil as well as criminally insane dr. krupp also know as "the bat". dr. krupp-who looks like a wild eyed and crazed orson wells-is a man with boundless visions of grandeur in him not only uncovering the long lost aztec treasure but now, unlike in the two previous movies he was in, creating life and using it in making an army of human robots to take over the world. an idea he must have gotten from watching ed wood's 1955 "atomic superman" classic "bride of the monster".unable to handle the mummy in his two other encounters with it, where he ended up getting thrown by it into a snake pit filled with deadly rattlers, dr. krupp had created a robot, with a human cadaver stuffed in it, to the job, of doing in the mummy, for him. with he mummy sleeping in its tomb at a local mexico city cemetery dr. krupp has his robot-man brake into the mummy's crypt to do battle with it and destroy it with its bolts of deadly radiation. ***spoilers*** the big built-up to the aztec mummy robot-man confrontation turns to be a big let-down with the mummy having no trouble at all dispatching the "tin-man" in less then 30 seconds together with its creator dr. krupp. all this while both dr. almada and his friend and assistant pinacate, who came to the mummy's aid, have nothing at all to do but sit back and watch the action. now without the mad and off-the-wall dr. krupp annoying it the mummy can go back to its eternal resting place without ever worrying about the problems of the modern world at large, like dr. krupp, that it has really no interest in.

following the pleasingly atmospheric original and the amusingly silly second one, this incredibly dull, slow, and uneventful sequel comes across as a major letdown. once again the nefarious criminal mastermind the bat (hammy luis aceves castaneda) is trying to steal valuable jewelry from the aztec mummy popoca. the bat builds a hilariously clunky lumbering robot with a human brain in order to achieve this heinous goal. flatly directed by rafael portillo, with a talky and tedious script by alfredo salazar and guillermo calderon, cruddy continuity (for example, the bat was clearly killed at the end of the previous film, but is miraculously alive and well here!), an excruciatingly sluggish script, an excessive amount of stock footage from the first two flicks, a meandering narrative, a crippling lack of action and momentum, largely dreary going through the motions (non)acting from an understandably disinterested cast, and a poorly staged climactic battle between the mummy and the robot (the movie finally bursts to sidesplitting stupid life with said big bash, but alas it barely even lasts two lousy minutes and thus proves to be much too little far too late to alleviate the severity of the general overwhelming boredom), this numbingly dry, drippy, and draggy snorefest rates as a complete washout.

the first 2/3 of this film wasn't that dissimilar to the american mummy films of the 30s and 40s. two lovers in ancient mexico dared to defy the law and were doomed to die. one became an aztec mummy whose job it was to guard the sacred treasure and his lady love. and the lady was reincarnated in the present day and the mummy was naturally attracted to her. so far, it's all the typical mummy film...though it's quite a bit slower and duller than the american versions. oh, and of course the aztec mummy looked really, really crappy.however, into this standard but boring film there is a super-villain. why? i dunno--it sure didn't make any sense to have one. it seems this villain wants the treasure and he manages to hypnotize the lady and have her show them where the aztec treasure is buried. why does he need the treasure? well, to buy the equipment needed to make an army of atomic robots, dummy! but first he has to construct a single mummy to defeat the mummy, as the mummy has so far been unstoppable.you've got to see these "human-robots" as they look like the enormous clunky robots from flash gordon and other serials but they have a rubber head of a supposed dead guy inside! they really look hilariously funny and seeing the conclusion when there is a huge battle between the lethargic mummy and the equally slow robot is worth sitting through the rest of the dull movie. both battle in super-slow-motion like they are bathed in taffy... and it's done in such an artless and silly fashion that it is bound to elicit chuckles--certainly not thrills.overall, the film is dreadfully dull and a muddled mess--especially at the end. however, for bad movie fans, it's a must-see--it's bad but unintentionally funny and great to watch and laugh at with friends.

2/3 of this movie is recycled footage of the previous movies, a fact that's sadly obvious even to someone like myself who hasn't seen the original movies. and somehow it feels like a rip-off even though i haven't seen the stuff before. it's like that episode of every tv show where the characters sit around a photo album or something and you just see recycled footage of other episodes. i've seen some producers do extended montages of recycled footage, but never anything beyond 5 minutes or so. this movie is mostly stuff that had already been seen by audiences, so you could mount a case that it's one of the biggest rip-offs ever foisted on the motion picture public.i got to see it in the theater, in a 16mm print, which is good enough i suppose considering how rare this kind of material must be on film these days. i give the movie some credit for semi-convincing gothic atmosphere and for unintentional humor, but that's about it. the aztec mummy monster looks good, even has some mobility in his face which is better than most movie monsters of the period. but the robot is pitiful, although it's interesting that they made the human face totally visible. it's a "robot human" or something of the sort as they somewhat explain in the movie. i think that's considered an android. so technically in hard sci-fi terms this movie should be called "android vs. the aztec mummy", but i doubt anyone was too worried about technicalities here anymore than they were worried about quality. in fact the movie is so sloppily put together that it makes television look good. even the dubbing from mexican into english is lazy and weak -- for example at one point the hero says "i might as well begin at the beginning...." what the heck kind of translation is that? couldn't they at least have him say "start at the beginning" so that it doesn't sound repetitive? a high school newspaper editor could have fixed the screenplay of this movie. it's the epitome of utilitarian film-making, just absolutely nothing is in this movie that doesn't need to be there for the basic commercial purpose of the film. they put no more effort into making it than they had to, and considering the extensive recycled footage i would doubt that they actually spent more than a week making this movie.i will now cease posting about it on the principle that i don't want to expend more energy in the process of commenting than the creators of the movie actually expended while making it.

ah, such an original title for a very shoddy film. the dubbing is hilarious since the voices and mouths never seem to match. as a result, i had no idea what was going on as i watched this mess unfold. there are flashbacks within the flashbacks and no real time takes place until towards the very end. the aztec ceremony had me laughing. i rewinded it twice and got the best ab workout ever. the singing aztec lady is comic naturale and the dancing and costumes are a hoot. some guy gets a face full of acid, there's a lot of fighting, you have no idea who any character is (not that i really cared), and it's a whole noir mess. oh, and the actual fight doesn't happen for awhile, so during the movie feel free to get up, take a nap, take a trip. you won't miss anything exciting.

i saw this on mystery science theater 3000, and even that show couldn't really make this movie bearable. i could make a better movie with a broken camcorder and action figures. of course, you expect terrible special effects with a movie this old, but i've seen silents that were better. the storyline has enormous gaps that leave you trying to figure out why they are even at certain scenes. the cameraman apparently doesn't know what a tripod is, and had too much coffee, or something harder maybe, because the camera is always shaking around. i couldn't even follow the plot, but suffice it to say, this is the absolute worst movie i have ever seen in my life.update: i saw "epic movie" a while back and have decided to give this movie a 2. it's not the worst movie i've ever seen anymore!

i am a big fan of bad horrors, cheap horrors, b movies, and all that bottom 100 movies, and i do not deny those are the worst stuff ever to enter the big screen, or even your home video for that matter. some of them, e.g. the infamous manos the hands of fate, are truly bad, and watching them, especially on your own without any friends and beer around, is a torture for a good cinema taste. la momia azteca contra el roboto humano, however, was not that bad. well, of course it's bad - it's silly, dated, corny, cheap, etc., there's an aztec mummy, a tin robot, a fat masked villain, a mad scientist, mexican mobsters, etc. the montage is poor, the lines, well, let's say the lines are not theatrical, the fx and sfx are the best what the mexican low budget production could've offered, etc. etc. still, the movie is fun. it's so bad it makes you laugh cheerfully for an hour time. sure it depends on one's sense of humor, however i'm pretty sure la momia should teach any newcomers to this kind of cinema how to enjoy it. please note: the movie lasts for about an hour, and i think it's just enough time of silliness one is able to easily digest. there's also another thing - watching la momia can give you a clue what was the whole sf/horror genre concept back in the fifties, when you compare it to the present day matrix era of cinema entertainment. i think it also shows how both the industry and the audience evolved, due to the fact the watches like la momia still attract full house in the theaters for some special shows (movies like this are special alright), and very often receive a standing ovation.

despite having a very pretty leading lady (rosita arenas, one of my boy-crushes), the acting and the direction are examples of what not to do while making a movie.placed in southern mexico, popoca, the aztec mummy (real aztecs, by the way, did not made mummies) has been waken up by the lead characters and starts making trouble in mexico city suburbia, during the first movie (the aztec mummy). in this second part, the leading man and woman want to find th mummy and put it in its final resting place (a fireplace would have been my first choice...)into this appears the bat, a criminal master-mindless stereotype of a criminal genius who creates a "human robot" (some idiot inside a robot suit) to control popoca and (get this) take over the world. the final match between the robot and the mummy is hilarious, some of the worst choreography ever witnessed. the funniest part is that this movie was made and released by a serious mexican movie studio!the acting is just as awful hearing the movie in spanish as it is in english (they dubbed the over-acting!). you should watch this movie through mst:3000. the comments are even funnier.

this movie should have been billed as three movie-summaries linked together to form a full-length feature film (including lots of shots of people slowly walking down dark corridors and streets). be warned! the first hour of this movie is simply a re-hash of the first two aztec movies as told by the main character. the actual movie doesn't start until the thing is almost over. i must say, the overacting on the part of the bat is quite hilarious.as for the robot, i thought a robot was a mechanical device that may or may not resemble a human. the bat's "robot" consists of a radioactive reanimated corpse encased in a lead robot-body. as tom servo put it, "he's not that impressive; he doesn't even have knees!" that, and it takes the robot about an hour just to lumber across the room. but once he catches you, watch out! he'll disintegrate you with a touch (powered by radium? pluh-ease!).this is a great movie when accompanied by joel and the bots. otherwise, you're just a glutton for abuse.

"rvam"'s reputation preceded it. i first heard of it in one of those medved style movie books, "the 50 worst movies ever" or "the golden turkey awards", or something like that. every review of the film basically said that this movie was so bad that it would make you bleed from the eyes to watch it. so when the exposed film society finally got around to showing it, i was anticipating the kind of cathartic experience that only a true cinematic stinker can provide. however, "robot" wasn't really all that bad. oh, this is definitely a "z" film through and through. some of the voice dubbing (as is usually the case for k. gordon murray imports) is awfully cheesy, and the movie itself seems to be structurally something of a frankenstein, since a huge chunk of it seems to be footage from a previous "aztec mummy" movie, narrated with a voice-over by the leading man. a dead giveaway: anytime the question "then what happened?" is asked more than twice in the dialog, you are looking at reassembled footage put together with little regard for plot coherence or momentum. in rvam, "then what happened?" or "what happened then?" is uttered at least four times in the 1st hour. even without the structural problems, the plot and dialog don't translate well to an older american audience. for instance, as the hero explains (and explains and explains) the back-story. he includes a remark about doctor krupp, "a doctor who suddenly turned into an evil master criminal" and began his quest for the treasure that the aztec mummy guards. no background, no explanation, he just "suddenly turned evil". obviously, this was aimed at a pretty undiscriminating audience. the clincher, though, is the "robot", the supposed "showcase" of this movie. this robot is the worst robot special effect since "undersea kingdom" or even "santa claus vs. the martians". compared to this hunk of junk, the tin man from the "wizard of oz" looked like the terminator chassis that chased linda connor through the foundry in t2. the aztec mummy himself is well designed and executed; he's recognizably undead, familiar enough to look like a mummy, and yet distinct from the "boris karloff" bandage collection familiar to most american audiences. but whoever designed the robot in this followup had no feel for the concept...or no budget. they could at least have given him some knees, for heaven's sake. in addition, the titular battle is terribly executed and lasts less than 60 seconds. (i've seen shoving matches on junior high playgrounds that are more convincing.) then the movie basically just stops. that seems a bit of a rip off considering the amount of time the movie spends building up to the battle itself.in spite of all these problems, the movie isn't horrible or incompetent the way a coleman francis film or a larry buchanan film was. compared to "monster a-go-go" or "attack of the eye creatures", "rvtam" is like a coppola film. it's just kind of dull and boring and silly. the actors are competent (in a mannered b movie way) and reasonably photogenic; dr. krupp, in particular seems to be having a wonderful time as he leers and plots and capers about in his cape and "phantom of the opera" suit. i often found myself rooting for him, in spite of his being the villain. anyway, i've seen much, much worse. file this with "samson vs the vampire women", under "interesting mexican juvenile oddities".

i have watched this movie twice in the past six months (what i go through so you don't have to).the first viewing left me half crazed and babbling.the second viewing at 5am on a rainy morn was a little better.i only screamed in agony once. seems pocona (the aztec mummy)had the hots for a certain aztec princess who was"supposed to keep her maiden".obviously they gave each other the business and were put to death for it.(now that is severe!).but before they are the film tries to put us to death with a screeching aztec ceremony.the singing will make your ears bleed. anyhow there is the usual reincarnation nonsense. not to mention a treasure map on a breastplate & bracelet guarded by that swathed slob,pocona.by this time pocona looks like he's been on a 2000 year bender and is after the defilers of his tomb.his groans & moans sounds like he has a bad case of montezuma's revenge(or he read the script for this movie).that will make your breath stink. an evil dr von krupp appears wanting the aztec treasure(possibly to finance acting lessons & screenwriting classes for cast & crew).he is called the bat because in the curse of the aztec mummy he wore a bat like cape, hat and something like a ski mask over his face.guess it's better than the laughing fat man. the bat in typical mad scientist fashion wants to rule the world. he stresses this by rolling his eyes,laughing maniacally and chewing the scenery.he has cobbled together an invincible robot.looks like the 'bot was made from a garbage can, a chandelier and the grill of a 1957 buick.this will make your eyes bleed.a company even takes credit for making this tin can! well the mighty showdown between pocona and the robot takes place in the mummy's new crypt having been made homeless earlier. about half of this movie is culled from "la aztec momia"never released in the us in its original form but in a chopped atrocity from jerry warren(see my review on "attack of the mayan mummy") and "curse of the aztec mummy".the robot is frankly stupid as are most of the characters.if that and the plot doesn't make you howl with laughter nothing will. my first impression was so bad it would have gotten a one. but after seeing "mayan mummy"(which is a movie deserving of being burned) and watching "robot" again, it garners a 3.you have to watch this with no expectations at all. then it can be naively pleasant.

the usual disclaimer - i do not give 1 star ratings to movies which are harmless, bad, low budget and silly, although they may deserve it. these films are often funny, and get rated 2-4 based sheerly on entertainment value - not as a representation of their exemplary film artistry. this film fits this model perfectly. it is a mexican monster movie, riddled with voice-over narrative and extremely weak not-so-special effects. the makeup is not that bad, and the acting is sometimes quite entertaining, but this film is almost as silly as aliens vs predator and the script isn't half as slick (aliens vs predator might get a 1 from me, but i want to see it again before i commit).the plot is ridiculous, but deliciously convoluted. if you've read this far, you must really want to know... a group of remarkably unscientific scientists comprise the main characters. most of them are heroes - sort of - but one is (of course) mad, and quite perverse. this mad scientist invents a laughable nuclear powered robot (who looks a bit like the tin man from wizard of oz, but has a human face inexplicably located inside its head). an aztec mummy, discovered by the same 'scientist' whose wife just so happens to have been an aztec princess in a past life (don't ask), is pitted against the robot for the big "climax" the fight scene alone is enough to put the most stoic movie watcher on the floor in belly laughs.for what its worth, given the budget and the utter silliness of the script, this is a very entertaining low budget goof ball monster movie. if you're into that sort of thing, go for it.

i`m in two minds about following , the film debut of christopher nolan . part of me admires it for costing 6,000 dollars to make but part of me hates it for being too art house . in many ways it reminds me of the cult movie pi , a film i disliked , and i can`t get my head around the central plot of a man who wants to be writer following people around . wouldn`t it be more logical for someone wanting to be a writer to sit in front of a keyboard and write ? oh well i guess following gives indie film makers hope that just because they made a no budget movie costing $6,000 over two thousand imdb members will vote for it and over five hundred members will comment on it , but you have to wonder if this movie would be so well regarded if it wasn`t made by the director of memento ?

on humphrey bogart's first trip to hollywood, he got his first leading man role in this b picture love affair. the first thing you ought to realize is that this film has absolutely nothing to do with the classic love affair later in the decade with charles boyer and irene dunne or the two remakes that followed. it's not half as good any of those films.in fact bogey is second billed to dorothy mackaill as a spoiled heiress who finds out she's been living her extravagant lifestyle courtesy of her late father's best friend and financial adviser hale hamilton. it comes as quite a shock to mackaill. she considers a show business career as a way for an income.bogart is a test pilot who is also an aeronautical engineer and he's designing an ultimate airplane motor and is looking for investors. mackaill is willing to do it, besides she likes what she sees in bogey.considering the cynical roles that bogart later made a specialty, it's a bit disconcerting to see him as this highly moral and self righteous character in love affair. the part doesn't wear well on him.love affair is your average b program second feature, nothing terribly special about it.

where should i begin with this movie. all i know is that it is a mess. be the script, story, or the actors. first of all, this movie is very disappointing from salman khan who gave us a fun dulhan hum le jayenge and har dil jo pyar karega before this. second rani is getting really annoying, appearing in every stupid movie since kuch kuch hota hai (glad saathiya stopped this nonsense). the story is stolen from the wedding singer, but ruins the funny movie. the dialogues are lacking. i may have laughed here and there, but entertained? no!!! salman khan was tolerable in the above mentioned movies, but here he is insane. his character is poorly written. one minute he is poor and next minute you wonder how is he poor. rani mukherjee looks like a plain jain and wasn't putting any effort. she luckily redeemed her career with saathiya because her career was going haywire around this time. pooja batra put a little charm here with her looks but it is still not enough. jackie shroff is wasted. kashmira shah's beauty and acting has ran away from her because she chose such a horrible script. raveena tandon looks beautiful, but puts little performance. mohnish behl gets the award for worst (supporting) actor (they need razzie's because there have been terrible movies in india). he says stupid dialogues, dances terribly, looks weird, and is not in his regular form. just to tell you, there is more to the cast who are also terrible. if it weren't for raveena's awesome beauty in aa meri life bana de, i wouldn't give the movie a point. otherwise the dancing by salman was terrible. pooja batra was dancing like a wind in savariya, otherwise i wish the costumes were given a make-over and the rest of the cast (and their monkey dancing) had been blown away from the wind. the good song of the album was o priya o priya which doesn't have a good enough picturization. same goes for the half way decent title song. otherwise this movie (and the rest of the songs) are a no-no for everyone.

k murli mohan rao made the much better bandhan in 1998 this film is an awful remake of the wedding singerbasically in short, the film consists of: salman khan who in those days used to have the role of a dejected lover who looses his girl and also he had his comic scenes where he hammed badly even today he does well he does it all here too and also looses his shirt in scenesjackie shroff- wasted, bored and tired, his role is so stupid he is shown as a lover of pooja bhatra then in 1 scene he is shown as a womanizer?inder kumar- confusing characterization againrani mukherjee- boring, overweight and does nothing special pooja bhatra- tall, fair and actress worthy but lacks talentkashmira shah- says a dial as if a poetrymohinish behl- poor fellow the 2 kids were awful toothe story is the same and has awful comic scenes, a sudden love story and boring drunken scenes plus a forced comic track of shakti kapoordirection is poor music is decentsalman khan just goes through the motions, jackie is bad, rani is as usual, pooja is bad, mohinish and kashmira are nothing great inder is awful

when i read the reviews of kahin pyaar na ho jaaye, i thought, "huh?". it was that confusing. to be sure, i went to watch the film and what do you know? it's a remake of "the wedding singer". several scenes have been changed to suit the whole essence of indianness, but the rest of it is a direct lift from the 1998 hollywood hit. bollywood is no stranger to remakes, but this is one so poor that it pains me just to watch it. i groaned so much watching this and i realized i wasn't the only one doing so! one guy actually walked out of the theater and never came back! salman khan should seriously stop doing comedy roles. he shrieks and whines too much. why can't he just take it easy? he doesn't do justice to the role originally acted out by adam sandler. he doesn't have sandler's sense of comic timing. rani is a wonderful actress and one of my favorites, but she's no drew barrymore either. the scene where she stands in front of a mirror practicing to say her new surname ("hi, i'm mrs pugalia") doesn't match up to barrymore's version ("hi, i'm mrs julia gulia"). i felt embarrassed watching that scene, even though i had loved the original. the music is not too bad. it's probably the only saving grace of this otherwise horrible film! avoid this at all cost!

very disappointing 7th chapter of this slowly dying series. very evident that the budget was extremely low. this movie was made for one reason and one reason alone. to sell puppet master toys! fans, such as myself of the series have decided, from what i have read and heard that the only one in the series worse than this is curse of the puppetmaster. in turn, turning us away from the series. opting to make this a pg-13 film, for whatever reason, did not work in the films favor. the plot seemed almost to be there, but was easily lost in the steady stream of nonsense. the only film in the series worth watching, also directed by decoteau is part 3 - toulon's revenge.granted, i do favor the scenery in the film. yuck!

retro puppet master is complete and utter crap.in particular,the puppets look stupid,and crappy.the acting was unforgivable and the story was rancid.this movie goes back into the the past,where the dolls where first created,thats not puppet master.retro puppet master is rated pg-13,the first puppet master to be rated pg-13.the movie contains no horror,or suspense.the fact that this movie was a puppet master film boggles the mind,because this installment doesnt have the buckets of blood,good acting,or any entertaiment like the previous movies did.dont see this movie,dont rent it,and dont even watch it f its on tv,because this film is stale,not violent,and completely crappy.2 out of 10.as a puppet master fan,i am disappointed...seriously.

i have never seen a movie so bad. it's not even entertaining enough to be a drinking game.it's so bad, i don't even want to talk about it... and that's the whole point of this, isn't it? please. don't bother to see this movie. 'nuf said.

in the literal sense....reminds you of those "cops-and-robber" or cowboys-indians" role-playing games you played with your 8 year old friends. tedious and un-inspired, the storyline was obviously written to make bad acting and dialogue seem as part of the plot, but all it does is showcase it. i cant believe john badham let his name be associated with this piece of crap. this could have been done better by a high school film buff who had been given the camera lighting, filmstock and editingdestined to be a time-filler on sci-fi channel, when they've overused everything else from their library, and barely better than the paid programming shill downstream.

there are no - no redeeming qualities to this film. they didn't check a single fact - not one about... anything. i feel sorry for larry miller, and even more sorry for his agent for not being more capable for finding him a more suitable venue.the adults are all idiotic. the effects are cheesy and devoid of any sense of reality. the music is honestly cheesy. the plot is beyond belief.i you want to see something good with your family, see anything else. take some time and check for mildew in your attic. my ten-year-old is mocking this film as we watch it. he's unfortunately learning that not every movie is worth watching.

now this is a movie i really dislike. it's one of the most boring horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere. the settings are not even attractive for the eye and do not serve for the movie's purpose. the puppets look really cheesy , not in a good way like in the puppet master 80's flicks. what did they do to our favorite toys?!the story is lame, not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets. there aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible. i felt asleep the first time i watched it, so i can recommend it for insomniacs.

retro puppet master starts in kolewige during 1944 where puppet master andre toulon (guy rolfe) & his living puppets plan to escape germany, hold up in an inn puppet master toulon reminisces about his early life & the point at which he learned the secret of giving life to dead objects way back in 1902 in paris when his younger self (greg sestero) ran the theate magique. he describes the fateful night when he met a 3000 year old egyptian sorcerer named afzel (jack donner) & the eventual love of hi life the young & beautiful ilsa (brigitta dau). he tells the story of how afzel passed the gift of life to himself & gave life to his own wooden puppets that were part of the theatre magique show. however the gift of life was also a curse as the ancient god sutek whom the secret was stolen from in the first place by afzel wants it back & everyone who has learnt it dead...as of late i have been on a bit of a puppet master bender as being a big fan of the first three i decided to watch the rest of the franchise & as such i have seen puppet master 4 (1993), puppet master 5: the final chapter (1994), curse of the puppet master (1998) & now retro puppet master in the space of a couple of weeks & boy was it tough to get through them all, especially this one as it's the worse of the series so far. retro puppet master feels like a cross between puppet master iii: toulon's revenge (1991) with it's period setting & puppet master 4 & puppet master 5: the final chapter with sutek trying to kill everyone associated with his stolen life giving secret. there's not much continuity here either, again there's none of the green serum featured in the earlier films & despite andre toulon committing suicide in 1939 at the start of the original puppetmaster (1989) he is seen alive & well during 1944 in this. the majority of the story is told as a flashback & concentrates on andre toulon himself rather than the puppets, the film focuses on his relationship with ilsa & him learning the secret of life & it's all rather dull & tedious stuff to be honest. even at only 80 odd minutes retro puppet master feels long & padded with no real pace & the no central concept as the plot never really settles down & generally hops around a lot. then of course there's the baffling decision to totally redesign the puppets which i found incredible, i mean why would the makers take the one basic thing that made the puppet master films so memorable & completely do away with it? the puppets are seen briefly at the start & the end but otherwise we get these rubbishy looking wooden caricatures that are nowhere near as cool as their modern re-workings. it's never even explained why these puppets were used rather than the ones all puppet master fans have come to love although one suspects that full moon was hoping to make yet another sequel which dealt with that very question.if a poor story & a complete lack of our favourite puppets wasn't bad enough full moon decided to go with a pg-13 rating for this making retro puppet master the only puppet master film not rated 'r' in the us (obviously other countries have their own film ratings systems) & therefore there's not a single drop of blood in the entire film, the puppets don't kill anyone, there's no swearing & no nudity either. this is tamer than tame kids stuff all the way. besides the puppets themselves being rubbish the special effect are the wost of the series too, there's no stop motion animation at all in this one, no cgi computer effects (surely in 1999 cgi was cheap enough?) & all the effects are of the stiff rod puppet type effects. i mean whenever you see a puppet 'walk' the camera is always positioned above it's wait so it's legs don't have to be shown & there's obviously some production assistant just pushing the thing along, that's as complex & state of the art as the special effects get.the one positive thing that retro puppet master does have going for it is that it looks rather nice, the period production design, costumes & props are actually quite impressive & it's a fairly handsome film to watch at times. apparently filmed in bucharest in romania which doubles up quite nicely for turn of the last century paris. the acting here is awful & maybe the worst of the series.retro puppet master is more or less the final puppet master film as the next one puppet master: the legacy (2004) basically edits together footage from the previous seven films & it's a pretty crappy way to round the series off which started so well with three excellent & distinctive little killer puppet flicks. don't bother with this, just watch one of the first three again & just remember the good times... the killer puppets would return in the terrible spin-off flick puppet master vs demonic toys (2004).

i watched the first few episodes a short while back and felt i couldn't take it anymore. the horrible looking fight scenes are the worst i've ever scene in my life. about one-third of each episode is dedicated to flash gordon and his "mighty" fight moves. i know fight choreography from that era isn't exactly up to par with today's standards, but this is ridiculous. they don't even try to make it look realistic. flash gordon, who hardly resembles a fighter, uses his drunken slow moves and bare fist to knock out four or five guys with knives, guns, and other weapons. give me a break! there's also a scene where he does some similar act while in the water. basically every episode has scenes similar to that. as for the rest of the episode, there's not much else i remember. i basically viewed it out of curiosity on what science fiction looked like 70 years ago.

thank god i was not operating any heavy machinery, it could have been an even worst disaster. shots were slow & very repetitive. different scenes, same shots, medium shot, medium shot, medium shot, snooze. story line was rather empty. william hurt was the worst. where did he get that stupid accent from? random shots of scenery just to include them really didn't add much. there were more shots of arbour traveling in her car than anything else. the direction really didn't take us into any of the scenes & it also didn't make me feel for any of the characters. i would have rated it a zero if imdb had the option. great sedative if you can't sleep. there went 2 hours of my life i will never get back.

lazy movie made by a lazy director. the characters are grotesque. despite the tragic of this war, there is no emotion at all in the movie. symbolism is artificial and inefficient (and old bosnian woman giving a photo of her son to arbour will "concretize" her willingness, will awake the super-mother sleeping inside her, a corpse eaten by worms to show the horror of genocide... too much is sometimes worst than not enough).this movie is only an advertisement, an empty elegy to a woman who is not a hero. she worked for united nations. remember un failed to protect civilians at srebrenica. who are the true heroes of this war? a canadian judge leading post-mortem trial for atrocities that happened mostly because her organization failed to prevent them? where is the criticism in this movie?

i was forced to watch 'changi' last year in year 10 australian history. looking around the class room, both classes, all 40 students were nearly asleep, all 40 heads on the table whispering to the person next to them. i refuse to believe that because i am only 16, that my opinion doesn't count, having studied world war two, i not only felt embarrassed and ashamed watching this australian piece of trash television. i was out of my mind at the appalling effort this mini series applied in the usage of film elements. the acting was poor, the screenplay was very inaccurate and the score was dreadful. please, do not watch this film, it is bias and very racists (to the japans).

"changi" is an australian comedy/drama set in the world war 2 japanese prisoner of war camp of that name. the story cuts between past events, and the present day, when the aged veterans plan a reunion. this is a much publicised and controversial miniseries, here in australia. the budget ran over ($6.5 million aust. dollars); historians and veterans criticised it's authenticity; and critics pilloried the uneasy mix of comedy and drama (shades of "pearl harbor"). series writer john doyle (half of the successful roy & h.g. comedy team), has tried to defend himself with comments about "the characters are composites of actual people"; "the troops used comedy to cope with the situation"; "it's only based on actual events"; "one of our actors was actually there" etc. i don't have a problem with any of these points. many superb fictional and factual dramas have come out of the japanese p.o.w. camp experience: "king rat", "tenko", "merry christmas mr. lawrence", "bridge on the river kwai", "paradise road", "empire of the sun", "blood oath", and "a town like alice". black comedy has often been used successfully in p.o.w dramas: "life is beautiful", "the great escape", "seven beauties", "stalag 17", "the colditz story", and even "hogan's heroes". so why is "changi" a monumental failure? - the acting in "changi" is uniformly excellent, the music and cinematography is good - it is the writing and direction that have let it down. every scene seemed to give me waves of deja vu. when anthony hayes is made to stand in the blazing sun, i thought "didn't i see alec guinness do this in "bridge on the river kwai"?". the sudden flashes into surreal song & dance brought back dennis potter's "singing detective", but without the finesse. this borrowing happened so often, it smacked of lazy writing by cut and paste, rather than homage. the constant intercutting between the past and present stories left me unable to concentrate on either. flash forward and flash back can be a useful tool - here it left me distanced from characters, where intensity was called for. the "ausiness" is overdone - every conversation seemed to include "stone the bloody crows" & such, that i was saying "i get the point, i know they're aussies". cultural stereotyping extended to the british and japanese too -sadistic young japanese officer; uptight british officer; wiser japanese commandant; fun-loving, rascally aussies etc. i thought i was watching "hogan's heroes on the river kwai". after 3 episodes i'm tuning out.

this was a very good show. i enjoyed the construction of real time and flashback, seeing the old diggers meeting again and recalling the terrors of their captivity in changi pow camp. the main problem with the way the show was written is that the scenes of life in changi are more like a holiday camp than what the place must have been like. i am old enough to remember film footage of the men being liberated from changi and other japanese pow camps. no actor could lose enough weight to have a resemblance of the state of those men. they made the jews of belsen look like sumo wrestlers. i have met several veterans from changi over the years. many would never ride in a japanese car, let alone own one. the physical and mental torture those men endured was too horrific for them to even talk about. what percentage survived? john doyle might be ok writing comedy for "roy and hg" (i hate that too) but this is a serious sugar coating of history that should never have been tolerated. i'm happy for satirists to write "the life of brian" and make fun of the crucifixion because it is obviously comedy, even if some consider it to be in bad taste. "changi" is written as a portrayal of a real event and, as such, might be regarded by younger people as a true record. great performances by a fine cast cannot redeem this lightweight screenplay.

milo is a complete rip off of the 1992 slasher flick mikey, if you actually check it up both films have the same tagline!but if you want to watch an incredibly funny film with absolutely no plot whatsoever......well then this is the film for you.the acting is terrible and the flashback scenes are overwhelmingly confusing. the story behind this atrocity is simple milo jeeder is a kid with serious family problems,his father is an abortion doctor who keeps unborn feoutus's in a jar (nice!) and was desperate for a child of his own, he figured out a way to bring one of these aborted children to life and he named him............. milo!!!!!aside from all the bad acting,terrible directing,annoying sound of milo's voice and the ear piercing sound of the bell on his bike ,if you take away all that badness its still a bad but funny attempt at a film.i'll give it a bank busting 1 out of 10

four young grade-school girls witness the murder of one of their classmates during what they thought was just an innocent game. the killer is a strange young boy named milo jeeder. sixteen years later, the four survivors of the event re-unite under happier circumstances in the same town where it happened. they believe that milo drowned in a river shortly after the murder, but soon learn that the demonic killer milo has also returned, still a young boy, unchanged even after almost two decades.the cover for this movie makes it look really cool (yet i still expected a bad movie to come out of it). when i pop in the dvd into my player, the menu comes up and makes the film still look cool. sadly, this movie isn't all that it got my excited about. the movie is your average attempt at a slasher film and when i say average, i mean just like all those other small-budget slasher movies that have never been welcomed with open arms into most members of the horror community (i'm talking about you, the horror fan). in other words, you could walk up to any horror fan and the majority of responses would be "this sucks".what mistakes did the movie make? first of all, the dvd cover art makes milo look really dark but they blow it all by showing his face in the movie in many different scenes. he had the potential of being a very freaky character. secondly, the back of the cover art tells freddy, jason, chucky etc to pack their bags and move on out because milo is so much better... why in the hell would you want to say something like that when it comes to a no-name, low-budget slasher film that has obviously failed? i mean, it just raises your expectations of the movie, making it harder to impress itself upon you. in a last ditch effort to attract attention, it says (in very big letters) "from the creator of anaconda". just shows you how low they're going to get as much attention as possible for the movie.the gore in the movie sucks, the director gives you some hideous angles when milo attacks someone. the music isn't all that bad and i never once fell asleep during the movie (congratulations). i'm still trying to figure out what milo actually is. my best bet would be that he is a zombie, if anyone else knows, tell me. rest assured, i won't be losing any sleep over thinking about it.

this is easily one of the worst films i've seen in many years. i started viewing the film not expecting much and that is exactly what it delivered....not much! in fact, it ended up delivering even less than i expected. my first reaction when i saw the opening portions of the film was that i would probably end up rating it a "4". i thought that it seemed to have reasonably good photography and a haunting atmosphere.as the film progressed however, the rating kept going down and down in my mind mainly due to pedestrian acting and a plot that went from being just plain silly and tasteless at the beginning to being both silly and repugnant near the end. by the time the movie was over, i was willing to rate it no more than a "1". don't waste your time or money on this one.

i happened to catch this supposed "horror" flick late one friday night, i wish i'd gone to bed! tell me.. is a 3 ft tall raincoat-clad twerp on a gurly bike supposed to convey some sort of fear? not here, yet mi-low is still able to beat the crap out of the janitor (antonio fargas) who is three times his size(?) uh-huh. and the ending is so pitiful... it just leaves you hanging with nothing to go on what-so-ever! i found myself asking, "is that it???"acting is about as good as it'll get in a low budget film. the aforementioned fargas delivers a decent performance; but it is my conclusion that jennifer jostyn maybe one of the worse actresses to ever strut into tinsel town! sure, cute face, but bad acting.rating: 1

this movie sucked sooo bad, i couldn't even watch the ending. milo's voice was too low and i couldn't understand what he said as well as some of kendra's lines. also, where did he get all these wedding dresses from; it was very impractical. the movie failed to elaborate on milo's drowning and how it made people ridicule dr. jeter and his practice. overall, i was disappointed that i was unable to give this movie a rating of zero because by grading this movie as a one, i felt i was giving it undeserved praise.

this movie scared the hell out of me for no good reason. the eerie music was well written but other than that, its a complete waste of time, and it really disturbed me.... i'm not really sure why either.... if you just want to see a bad 'b' horror movie, i guess you could give it a shot, but only as a last resort

this has got to be the worst horror movie i have ever seen.i hated it so much i wanted to come here and complain about how bad it was. normally bad movies are no big deal, but something about this one if you hated it.. you really hate it.if anyone liked this you probably enjoyed baby geniuses, i thought i could never find a movie that was worse then that one.. i guess not.

this movie was by far the worst movie i've ever had to endure. i couldn't believe that they tried to pass it off as a serious movie, it was so bad i couldn't even laugh at it's pathetic attempt to entertain me. if you want cheesy horror that you can laugh at, rent dr. giggles instead.

this movie was crap. the script is so full of holes; i can't see how the producers agreed to finance it.we are never given an explanation of anything. the acting is horrible. the plot sucks. this movie was obviously written for those 8 and under.i have to say this: why are the high school classes only 2 minutes long? teacher walks in, finds a frog in the desk, or drawing on the chalkboard, and 30 seconds later, the bell rings, class is over. the kids haven't even opened their books. can we have at least a little continuity?oh, the dialogue. milo jeter is the re-incarnated, aborted fetus, zombie thing. do we really need the line, "this is dr. jeter's office. dr. jeter, milo's father." thanks for the tip; i could never put that together myself. it never gets any better.why does milo talk the way he does, even in the beginning? was milo ever `real'. or was he never real, just always what he currently is? and if it was always that way, why the unexplained `accident' milo had?besides "what is milo?", what are all the unresolved items for? we see all these contraptions in his father's medical office, and are never given an explanation of what they are for, or what they have to do with the story. what are the injections for? what about the aquarium contraption? they obviously aren't needed. (see the movie, it'll make sense). and what does this medication do to anyone? apparently nothing, since it has no effect on the lead actress.this movie is a very, very bad rip off of all the other slasher movies. it's a really awful friday the 13th/halloween slopped together by a 10-year old writer. it's not cheesy enough to laugh at, it's just an incredibly frustrating bore.

stay away from this movie at all costs. i was suckered into watching this movie in a bet to see which one of us knew the t "worst movie of all time". needless to say this one won hands down. it is long and drawn out, and has no purpose or plot from what i can gather. a movie about a killer kid raised from a fetus that was grown outside the womb just has no place inside your vcr. if you are extremely bored and have no life watch this movie. but if you rather keep your sanity, stay away.

this movie was so weak that it couldn't even come up with good cliches to rip off. i love horror movies and will see practically anything, but if i had it to do over again i would have skipped this one entirely. you may think that i'm exaggerating, but i challenge anyone to find anything even remotely satisfying or interesting about this piece of garbage. not scary, not funny, not curious, not worth it.

typical story of an evil kid going after people. i suspect that antonio fargas (huggy bear on "starsky and hutch") and vincent schiavelli didn't want to stress this junk on their resumes (actually, schiavelli left this life with a mostly good resume). sometimes i wish that the killers in these movies would just go after the idiots who decide that we need a new one of these movies every other month (note: that comment is not to be taken seriously; i just think that slashers have lost their touch).anyway, this is one movie that you'll do best to avoid. it's ninety minutes to two hours that i'll never get back.

do you get it? like the car. these are the jokes, folks. softcore beach blanket bingo with aliens answers many of life's important question. what do the relatives of celebrities do for some cash? how does a hot tan alien wash herself? how much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood? well, maybe not that one. linnea quigley, member of the softcore hall of fame, provides some comic relief. nikki fritz, also a member, show her talents. sarah bellomo is not as bad as you might expect from a porn star. this is not erotic, except the shower scene, and not funny enough to make up for the rotten plot. the sequel has a couple of pleasant scenes as well with miss bellomo.p.s. the title is a good example of alliteration.

yes, it was an awful movie, but there was a song near the beginning of the movie, i think, called "i got a woody" or something to that effect. i would love to find a sound track of that if there is one available. i saw this song on mst 3k, and as awful as it was, it had it's moments, and that song was one of them.if you like babes in bikinis, this is the movie for you, but if you don't, then don't bother. it was great material for mst 3k, i have to admit though. i would really love to know where to get a copy of the soundtrack though. not just that song, but a couple more were really funny, and are classics as far as i'm concerned.

tacky, but mildly entertaining early 90's soft core comedy features xena (sarah bellemo), luna (tamara landry), and sola (nicole posey), as three outer-space teenagers. xena's parents have gone on vacation for a couple of days. following some persistent persuasion from her friends, xena agrees to take her father's spaceship for a ride. the end result? they wind up running out of gas in space, and crash-land on planet beta 45, aka earth. meanwhile, teenagers dave (michael todd davis) and jerry (ken steadman) have come to california to stay the summer with dave's uncle bud (joe estevez ) a beach bum who lives right on the beach. the three of them wind up meeting our three space girls who have walked away from the crash without a scratch. uncle bud is about to be thrown out from his soon-to-be-condemned beach pad thanks to sally (linnea quigley), who lives right up the hill and used to be in a relationship with bud. she's also a bikini magnate, and is trying to win a bikini design contest to the tune of, $30,000....exactly what bud would need to fix up his property, so the girls decide to try to win the prize for him. and that's about it, folks. knowing that their paper thin plot was barely enough to sustain a feature length movie, the filmmakers subject us to scene after scene of endless beach parties featuring tons of extras gyrating their half naked bodies in the scorching sun. oh, and lets not forget the sex. there's quite a deal of it. before i go any further, i need to put this movie in context. it was released in 1993, long before the advent of such soft core labels such as surrender cinema and seduction cinema. compared to these newer, edgier, more explicit movies, the soft core movies of the 90's sure seem somewhat mild. when beach babes from beyond first came out in 1993 from the full moon offshoot torchlight entertainment, it was heralded as the debut release of a label that specialized in "mature audiences" type films. needless to say, the times have changed. this particular film genre has gone from a few steamy, but brief sex scenes and fleeting glimpses of female full frontal nudity to extended sex scenes that occasionally threaten to venture into the realm of hardcore. looking at beach babes from beyond again after viewing it upon its 93' release, it's safe to say that if this same film were to be made today, there would be a hell of a lot more emphasis on the sex scenes and less time spent on plot and dialog. as for the sex scenes themselves, they tend to run hot-and-cold. our three space girls waste no time in getting comfortable with the boys that evening. so each couple gets a soft core scene, complete with annoying slow motion camera work and too dark lighting. they're really not that horrible, and are surprisingly graphic in a few spots, especially the scene between xena and jerry that takes place in the back of a trailer. but the one sex scene that really leaves a lasting impression, and causes you to be surprised in its overall intensity, occurs quite early on in the film. sally is attending a topless photo shot with three of her models posing by a pool. all of the actresses in this scene are beautiful gorgeous, but nikki fritz stands out from all the two due to her enormous presence. remember that this point in her career she had yet to achieve the type of enormous popularity that soon would follow. her posing nude by a pool leads to an unforgettable fantasy sequence where she shows her soapy body in a tub and then again when walking away from her bath. walking toward the bed towards a nearly nude pumped up guy in the waiting, we get a full length complete nude scene with her almost heart shaped rear end and perfectly shaped back. it's good that nikki's back is so muscular as it is about to get a pretty good workout. nikki spends the next few minutes completely nude with a hunky guy in a variety of positions in a scene that is filmed completely differently than the three other lovemaking scenes. no dark lighting or annoying slow motion here...just two actors in one enormous bed sans sheets and covers who seem at time to be barely acting at all. nikki's ecstatic body language just goes to prove that few other actresses seem to enjoy filming sex scenes as much as she does. it's really the only time where beach babes from beyond truly delivers the goods. but even without this spectacular scene, i am mildly recommending this film just for the fact alone that it's fairly watchable and never dull no thanks to an incredibly energetic and attractive cast, many of whom would show up in various direct to video features in the remainder of the decade.

i am easily pleased. i like bad films. i like films featuring attractive young women in small amounts of clothing.this film gives all the above a bad name. yes, you know going in that what you're getting is not high art, or anything like. but, even for the type of movie it is, beach babes from beyond isn't very good.some people have given it 10. i can only assume that these are people who have had the organs which enable rational thought to take place surgically removed.it isn't very good. it simply isn't very good.3 out of 10 solely on the grounds of a) novelty value for the famous relatives and burt ward and b) some of the girls are cute.oh, by the way, did i tell you that it isn't very good?

documentary content: amazing man, amazing movement he started, amazing stories- most of them yet to be really told.celluloid treatment: nike ad. sorry, ain't got nothing else to say about this but that you can say all you want about the dire circumstances in the favelas, but... if you attempt to support that claim with flashy and romanticized images and camera-work of that life, the humbleness necessary to show this life as an outsider filmmaker goes out the window. and with that goes the legitimacy of the narrative. besides that, the time-space continuum in the film is all off, and i'm not necessarily against that in films as a tool, but here it serves only to confuse the viewer into wondering what was said when; thus leading me to the question: is this a documentary or a docudrama?cococravescinema.blogspot.com

i'd have little to add to bowlofsoul23's bull's-eye comment here. but as the first brazilian (born, raised and living in rio de janeiro, in a neighborhood just a few miles away from the favela of vigário geral, depicted in the film) to comment on u.s.-financed "favela rising" here on imdb, i get mixed feelings: on the one hand, it's good that the dire situation of brazilian favelas are getting more attention from filmmakers and the media, both from brazil and abroad, since local governments seem to have given up a long time ago. one the other hand, it's incredibly frustrating that "favela rising" turns out to be such a missed opportunity for enlightening non-brazilian audiences on the issue, because first-time directors jeff zimbalist and matt mochary (who are from the u.s. and, understandably, neophytes on the matter) turn the biography of afroreggae group leader anderson sá into a glamorous canonization in this superficial, one-sided, under-researched and misleading documentary. good intentions, muddled results. "favela rising" looks like a tv-ad, is shallow as a prime-time tv interview, and biased as a promotional video."favela rising" feels uncomfortably phony for a brazilian viewer, and not only because of its hype visual treatment of a bleak reality, and its misplaced feel-good happy- ending. "city of god" is an obvious reference here, with cog actors leandro firmino and jonathan haagensen cameoing for no apparent reason other than "hype". "favela rising" is, allegedly, a documentary about the afroreggae group and its leader anderson sá, but beware: when you see the scenes shot in favelas overlooking the beautiful rio shore line, you might as well be warned that vigário geral (the home of afroreggae and anderson) is located in an area of rio far away from any beach. strange choice of location, to say the least."favela rising" is probably confusing for non-brazilians, who won't know many of the interviewees (and the film won't tell them either) and will have to wait for the closing credits to find out that many of the songs on the soundtrack are not by the afroreggae band (though you'll get suspicious when you start to hear pink martini, of all people!). they won't know either that important issues were simply left unmentioned: why does the film push the notion that afroreggae is a one-man project? why not acknowledge the many partners who supply it with substantial financial and logistic support, like rio's city council, private brazilian corporations, multinational recording companies and international ngos, without which afroreggae might not even subsist? why not state clearly that vigário geral is still plagued by violent drug wars, and that its dwellers still live in constant fear of attacks by traffickers and cops? why not state clearly that many of the archive footage clips showing police violence and corruption did not take place in vigário geral? how and why did the kid richard murilo finally join afroreggae? why on freaking earth wasn't he interviewed once again at the end of the film?as for anderson himself, the film leaves a lot of loose ends for the viewer: what's the story about anderson having "two" mothers? is the baby he holds in his arms his son? why is he inspired by shiva? is he a buddhist? why does a candomblé woman appear on the beach when the films mentions anderson's "miraculous" recovery from the accident? is he a candomblé follower? why not let him explain the contradiction of starting a group that fights drugs and simultaneously praises bob marley? if afroreggae is also a pride-building movement for black people from favelas, why are the girls in the afroreggae band limited to booty-bouncing routines? no, you won't get any answers to these questions either.instead, the filmmakers are interested in turning anderson sá into a composite mix of pop-star, malcolm x, gandhi and christ (check out that last image of the statue of christ the redeemer atop corcovado hill, immediately after showing anderson "miraculously" walking after his surgery). and that's the worst thing the filmmakers could do to anderson and his cause: turn him into a special chosen one (by the time they show his surgery scar, you're ready to believe it's a mark from god). because what's remarkable about anderson -- who's the most ordinary guy you could ever meet -- is that he helped change his environment not by being "special" but by copying and adapting winning projects (like the olodum movement in bahia, among others) to his own community, with strong support by friends, artists, intellectuals, politicians, businessmen and the media. if you're not fluent in portuguese you probably won't notice that anderson isn't particularly bright or articulate (unlike his sharply witty partner josé junior), as much as he isn't particularly talented as a singer, lyricist or musician. yet his "ordinariness" might have been the film's true "inspirational" core: to show that anyone with idealism, perseverance and steady support can in fact contribute significantly to his or her community, no need to be jesus incarnate. because what really matters is the movement -- afroreggae -- not the guy, see? haven't we had enough of personality cult? by the end of "favela rising", you probably won't know much more about rio's favelas than you did when you walked in -- you'll just have seen what some of them look like.

remember those old kung fu movies we used to watch on friday and saturday late nights when our babysitters thought we were in charge? well, this movie plays exactly like one of those movies. patsy kensit's biggest claim to fame was the love interest to mel gibson's character in "lethal weapon 2," and this performance was one of the reasons why she's never made it big: she's a terrible actress.in "lethal weapon 2," i thought she was cute. cute enough to check out some of the other movies she'd been in, including "loves music, loves to dance" another big let down, which i, obviously, was not impressed with, either. but, as attractive as she is to my eyes, my soul screamed at me to turn it off because she played another cheap, predictable role, and done it very badly.in this movie, kensit stars as a comedienne (and not a good one, either) who's working the clubs of france (couldn't cut it in her own homeland, so she's making their ears bleed), who's down on her luck, but, even worse, the french government wants to throw her out because of an expired visa (or maybe they just caught her act). but she gets married to this casanova (freiss), who is just as down on his luck, and the predictability begins...terribly! is there any way to give this movie a negative rating? 1 out of 10 stars is over rating it!

possible spoiler alert, though there's not much to spoil about this film. i saw project a part ii not having seen the first movie. i don't think i missed much. project a part two is not only the worst jackie chan film i've seen to date (yes worse than `fantasy mission force'), this film is one of the most unwatchable films the world has ever seen. it's right up there with `plan 9 from outer space' on the sleep inducing scale. the plot is twisted up and knotted like a 50 foot ball of yarn the cat's been playing with and finally left for dead. the `humor' if you could call it that, seems to have been written by an annoying high school freshman, who despite how many people tell him he's not funny, is determined to get his lame humor out no matter how painful a movie is made. and this movie is painfully bad. the plot involves jackie chan as a navy officer recruited by the police force to round up `all known criminals'. he rounds them up in the first half hour of the movie, and i prayed for a quick ending which i didn't get. why the movie bothers to progress from this point i haven't a clue. the movie drags on and on and on with no purpose, no plot, and attempts at humor that fail so miserably, they make carrot top look like a comedic genius. the kung fu in this movie is lame, and forgettable. there's better kung fu in that movie about the 3 ninja kids. project a part ii is neither an action movie nor a kung fu movie, it is however a complete waste of the talents of jackie chan and maggie cheung who have made films worlds superior to this. as jackie chan repeatedly escapes certain death, i enter `blair witch' mode asking (and wishing) `is he going to die now, so the movie can end? `. an example of how ludicrous this movie is: jackie chan is handcuffed to another man. a gang of pirates (that look nothing like pirates) throw axes at jackie. does jackie grab one of the wayward axes and break the chain on the handcuffs? no! you see that would spoil the `hilarious' gag of him being handcuffed to another person. if you have a friend who laughs at everything, i encourage you to watch this movie with him or her, and watch as even they won't get a chuckle out of this film. if you're an insomniac this movie is sure to put you to sleep. do not operate heavy machinery while watching plan a part ii. possible side effects include headache, retinal strain, and death by boredom. 0/9 stars

i've always loved horror flicks. from some of the usual well-known like "the exorcist" to some of the more underrated like "black christmas" or "just before dawn". but who are people kidding,even calling this trash a b-movie. it's straight up bottom-of-the-barrel z-grade. the acting is the worst ever on film. really,i've seen better on an episode of the "young and the restless"...spoiler...lookout for when the woman comes to tell them about the legend of jack-o. she pauses sometimes for a matter of seconds as if someone is flashing her cue cards and she's struggling to read her lines. a riot! oh,and besides the bad acting,absolutely no gore or f/x. and jack-o looked like a plastic lit pumpkin. watch linnea quigley in "night of the demons",or "silent night,deadly night",far superior flicks.

man, this movies sucked. it appeared to have like seven different plots going on at once and they all made little to no sense. the special effects, costumes, and all that stuff were beyond awful. the acting was particullary bad. everything seemed so forced, especially the lines from the woman with the huge eyes and the little kid (his "noooooo" as he gets burried is so unenthusiastic it's laughable). a good portion of this movie is rather funny anyway. the one woman's death where she shoves a knife into a toaster, gets electrocuted, and magically turns into the crapiest skeleton dummy in the world had my friends and i laughing for a good ten minutes.bottom line: if you're into watching really horrible movies, seek this one out. if not, run for your life.

i bought this out of curiosity. how did john carradine (who died in 1988) and cameron mitchell (who died in 1994) make appearances in a film made in 1995? thanks to the miracle of unused film can footage that's probably been sitting on a shelf somewhere for ten years, that's how! you can tell because the film stock used to shoot their scenes doesn't match the film used for shooting "jack-o." the curse of ed wood lives on. the good thing for both carradine and mitchell is that this is exactly the kind of movie you'd expect to find on both of their filmographies. same goes for scream queens linnea quigley, brinke stevens and dawn wildsmith.the setting is oakmoor crossing on halloween, and some kind of curse is released when dumb, beer-guzzling teens disrupt a grave. the result: a hulking killer with a scythe and a big plastic pumpkin on his head! he (it?) goes after the wholesome kelly family for revenge (and kills others who get in his way). the father opens a haunted garage for the neighborhood kiddies. the son (ryan latshaw, son of the director) has one continuous, perplexed facial expression for all his scenes and one hilariously badly acted dramatic scene lying in a grave. at least he's a kid. the mother's eyes about pop out of her head while she strains to read her dialogue. there is also an annoying woman who shows up to explain things who seems to be trying to phonetically pronounce all of her dialogue.so what about the name actors? you see stevens, wildsmith and mitchell briefly on a tv screen (they're used to pad out the time). linnea has a bigger role as a babysitter, and she does exactly what she can with it. her enthusiastic performance helps a little bit. there's also one out-of-nowhere laugh when an ultra-conservative couple who watch a rush limbaugh clone on tv bite it. the woman slips on a rug and stabs a toaster with a knife. she's electrocuted and the end result looks like a flame-broiled muppet.all and all, pretty entertaining stuff! i wasn't bored!

i had known brad linaweaver at florida state u in the early 70's when he was an inspiring, inventive writer who i thought was headed for greater glory.and that is why i rented this video. well, well, well, the time has not been kind to mr linaweaver. i suppose the pressures of making a living makes higher aspirations expendable. another flower whose bloom has come and gone un-noticed in the summer breeze. amen. there is nothing more to say. and nothing more to add. a sad epitaph to a once blossoming career as stated above. but it is the price one pays for chasing shadows without a firm foundation or goals for oneself in life. because this movie has no goal, no purpose, and i kept telling myself, what happened to brad's creativity, his once shining genius? gone, gone, years of neglect has deteriorated his once shining mind.

i felt compelled to write a review after seeing the only review which gave this film a suspiciously high 9/10 rating. i say suspicious because it looks less like a review but more like a publicity statement. perhaps the filmmaker himself, or one of his mates, has written that "review"? naughty, naughty.i watched this movie on the propeller channel on sky tv expecting it to be truly awful. the special effects used were to be honest very, very good for a low budget film, and some of the acting wasn't that bad either, but most of the acting was really awful, but well done for trying, as i expect most were pals of the filmmaker.i think the filmmaker has done really well by trying to punch above his weight. i did find some of the film funny because it was trying to be super cool when it just wasn't.if you don't take this film too seriously and watch it whilst drunk with some mates you might well have a good time but probably not in the way it was intended. this film is no way a 9/10 but worth watching for a laugh bearing in mind it was made on a very very low budget and in fairness due credit to those involved in it's production.

i really did not want to write a harsh review of this movie because i genuinely appreciate how hard it is to make any kind of movie on an incredibly low budget, let alone attempt something as ambitious as a sci-fi.however this movie is truly awful. the acting is among some of the worst i have ever had to endure and as a fan of low budget movies that is a pretty serious accusation to make. there are plenty of aspiring actors out there who would work on a deferred payment scheme if they believed in the movie and what the director was trying to achieve. i'm sure the actors did their best as did everybody else involved in this production, but it simply was not good enough to pull off something of this magnitude.then there is the dialogue. very poor indeed. there is no excuse for that. i got the impression the script was hastily written on the back of a beer mat after some epic boozing session. i hesitate to use the word 'laughable' but that's exactly what the script is. i had no empathy with any of the characters. indeed they grated on me with the result that on more than one occasion i wanted to thump a couple of them mr stirton has overstretched himself by taking on too many roles. clint eastwood he is not. again, there are talented people out there willing to work on deferment if they believe in the project.much has been made of the special effects in this movie. for the money, they are exceptional, if somewhat overused. it is like someone said "i have after effects and boy am i gonna use it". whoever did the cg work was among the most talented of this crew.quite simply the money was not available to make as ambitious a movie as this attempts to be. kudos for attempting it, but unfortunately it fails to reach its heady goals in far too many ways.i salute everyone involved with its production, i really do, but for their next effort they either need to get a better producer or lower their sights to something more manageable.in conclusion i cannot recommend this effort to anyone other than the most enthusiastic of film students or habitual insomniacs. if you want to watch a true masterpiece of low budget sci-fi films try the student made "dark star" by a certain mr john carpenter.

i went through great efforts to get this movie after reading the comments on this site. i really don't have time to write reviews but i felt this was my duty as a sci-fi horror buff. this is only the second review i have written. the other was for dracula 3000. now to the point. this movie sucked. plain and simple. i kept wondering if i was watching the same movie as those who wrote all those "lovely" comments. i have seen movies with bad effects, bad acting, bad sound, you name it and i've seen it. but this really sucked. i don't care how much it costs or didn't cost to make, movies like this and dracula 3000 should be banned and the whole cast and crew arrested and jailed for time murder. by the way, did i mention that this movie sucked. i mean really sucked. the plot was non exist and the acting was weak. it seems like the writer saw pitch black and got upset because he didn't think of a plot like that first so he decided to make his own ripped off version. but instead, the suck factor took over and possessed him. don't watch this. you'll have more fun if you pull down your pants and sit on burning coals.

i pride myself in being able to sit through everything. i think "if i've paid the rental fee, then i'm going to at least watch it". i have found the exception to this rule- the planet. i don't know what the exchange rate is, but reading through the other comments i can only guess that £8000 must be around $150. i'll date myself but this movie reminds me of the old steve reeves movies of the 50's. he was a bodybuilder turned actor. he was in these really awful italian, dubbed movies that starred reeves as hercules or some other muscle bound hero. as a kid watching them you couldn't quite articulate why these movies stunk- you just knew they did. mike mitchell is the new steve reeves. that's it.. that's what this really was- a new telling of an old italian "spaghetti sand and sandals" movie. and, i kid you not- where was reeves born? glasgow, montana. this movie isn't so bad that it's kind of fun to watch- it's just plain bad.

this movie was awful, plain and simple! the animation scenes had absolutely terrible graphics. it was very clear to see that this film had about the budget of my grocery bill!! the acting was just as bad.. i've seen better acting in pornographic films. i would seriously like the hour and twenty minutes of my life back. in fact, i registered on imdb just so that other people don't get sucked into watching this like i did. don't get me wrong though, i love sci-fi films! this one seemed more like the intro to a video game :( i'm glad i only spent a dollar to see this one! the story line reminded me of the movie pitch black, a prisoner on a ship in outer space escapes. oh my goodness.. what are we gonna do??? i would not even let this play in the background of my house while i was cleaning! bottom line here, you can do better.

in all, it took me three attempts to get through this movie. although not total trash, i've found a number of things to be more useful to dedicate my time to, such as taking off my fingernails with sandpaper.the actors involved have to feel about the same as people who star in herpes medication commercials do; people won't really pay to see either, the notoriety you earn won't be the best for you personally, but at least the commercials get air time.the first one was bad, but this gave the word bad a whole new definition, but it does have one good feature: if your kids bug you about letting them watch r-rated movies before you want them to, tie them down and pop this little gem in. watch the whining stop and the tears begin. ;)

alright, we start in the office of a shrink, and apparently not a very good one. the main hero from the first jack frost is in the shrinks office blurting out random rhymes about jack frost. gee, alright my brother is yelling ''turn it off!''. anyway, back to the crappy movie.the shrink has his speaker phone on and is letting his secretary and her friends listen in on this heroic insane sheriff. i suppose he is supposed to be the hero from the first movie, but he looks nothing like him!. yadda yadda yadda, they laugh at the poor sheriff, yadda yadda. now some people are digging up the anti-frozed snowman, yadda yadda, now we're in a lab with some type of doctor people.. i don't quite see how this has to do anything, but their poking the anti-freeze/evil killer mutant snowman with needles, heating it, shocking it, adding strange and bizarre chemicals to it, the whole nine yards. nothing. alright, they give up and leave it in a fish tank. one of the doctors leaves his coffee on the top of the tank. the janitor walks in, cleans stuff, bumps the fishtank and the coffee spills the tank which makes jack alive.behold the power of mocha! now somehow he is in..uh.. i believe the bahamas... but it looked more like hawaii.. but it couldn't be hawaii! unless they spent all of their budget on the dang air plane tickets. bah.. i wont spoil the rest of this rotten movie, so you'll have to rent it and watch it your self... er... i wouldn't suggest doing so though.... sheesh..

i've got 10 plus year old computer games with better special effects! plot is choppy and very predictable. most of the actors seem like extras with no experience! everyone has scottish accents. it's like watching a crew of 'scotties' from star trek without the personality or charm. needless scenes of people putting up tents! tents with all of the supposedly high tech equipment! actors looking like they were not sure the camera was on them. nothing to make you care if these people survive or not! looks like it was made in someone's backyard and garage using low end equipment! nothing seems original or even slightly entertaining. do not waste your time!

i really didn't like this film~!!!! it was boring and didn't interest me that much at all.. i'm more of an action girl, and it had none. i went and rented this movie because of the other comment that was left.. but was totally mislead! don't get this movie unless you like the dessert and plenty of boredom. i just really didn't like the movie. it wasn't my style, but it could be yours.. you would just have to watch the previews or something but it's my recommendation if you're a girl.. don't get this movie! this scandinavian production draws on some of the observational strategies of godfrey reggio's koyaanisqatsi, allowing us to reflect on patterns and phenomena of human and natural existence from both intimate and sweeping viewpoints. this just isn't for me!

it was like someone was trying to make a scary video game and a documentary at the same time. the historical aspect was great. everything else was horrible, the plugs for the directors other movie that seemed to happen every other minute, the video of the actual ghost hunting was edited like a scary movie rather than an investigation, they had haunted house music and sound effects that would distract you from what was happening. thanks for wasted 2 hours of my time! when there was evidence, it would fly by! most of it was just people talking about the place.the episode of the ghosthunters show that went there absolutely destroys how this show was. i am so upset with sci fi channel for playing this, i haven't watched it since it aired.

how is this a documentary? much more like a walking ghost tour one might take in any given southern city. quotes were generously dropped throughout without the first effort at identifying the source. george orwell was the most identified quoter. documents were referred to without ever being produced in any form. flat out fraudulent shots depicting period film stock were spliced aside historical film reels with no separation from reality and self-promotion. film reels which were entirely unrealistic and improbable for the time at hand were dropped in, as if trying to ape blair witch, hoping to drum up a spook house on what would otherwise simply be dead real estate. is this not in some way a great disrespect to actual victims of tb, a dance on their collective graves for the sake of commercialism? the line between actual footage and manufactured self-service is so thin; the drippings of doubt so insignificantly played down; the scientific boundaries so blatantly ignored... how could this possibly be listed in my tivo as documentary? it's a vacation promo, and at that it fully succeeds.hell, i'd visit the joint if i could locate it on google earth. not scary said a previous poster. not too serious either, says i. fascinating story. flimsy film-making.

basically, this was obviously designed to be promotional material for the movie produced by the same horrible director, which happens to be even worse than this documentary and absolutely the worst movie i've ever seen, so avoid it at all costs.as for this documentary, it's entertaining; entertaining and blatantly misleading! most of the "historical" looking footage is most likely just that, historical footage from completely unrelated events that were sadly cut and pasted into this documentary to make it more dramatic than it would have ever been otherwise. there's no doubt that waverly is a pretty interesting place with plenty of it's own fascinating history, but manufacturing a documentary to market the locale and the related production is, for lack of better words, appallingly useless.and yes, i've lived in kentucky my whole life, and i have visited the location numerous times. waverly hills deserves respect; and there's nothing respectful about this lame documentary.

the first film i saw from these people was "children of the grave" and when i heard that this one was coming on i thought it would be good to watch mostly because waverly is a real place that is rumored to be haunted. this documentary/film was awful! there was too much fake commentary from the producers, directors, camera men...they needed to keep their faces out of this film. waverly has been rumored to be haunted for a long time yet if anyone in doubt about it watches this film they will no doubt start to believe that every story about the place is as fake as this documentary. the paranormal proof was horrible and almost non-existent. i have heard better evps from high school students with tape recorders in a bathroom! they tried too hard to make things scary and the end result was that nothing was scary. not the stories, not the blurry too dark to see anything videos, not the pictures, not the tape recordings! children of the grave was bad as well but at least it had some substance and a little bit of a creep factor. the only reason i am giving this a 3 is because the history portion of the show was very good and informative. learning about how the hospital came about, the daily life there,and how it ended was the only thing worth while in this 2hr piece of crap.

i watched this after seeing "death tunnel" (this being, without question, the worst movie i've ever seen in my life) so you can understand i went in rolling my eyes a little at seeing the directors and producers of that cinematic gem being in charge of this one. first of all, i thought the director and producer were the same guy. they both are kid rock meets dawg the bounty hunter. i watched the taps investigation, and i am not a skeptic- i think taps is the closest one will ever get to a scientific method in the field. that was cool and believable- i do believe they are haunted.but this, like the reviewer above mentioned, like taking a tour. okay a tour, fine, but the "investigators" and "group leaders" seemed to make a pretty penny and have a financial investment into whether its haunted or not, so when they have fantabulous stories, i have to take it with a heaping teaspoon of salt.as someone else mentioned, i could make out whatever they wanted me to see in the picture about 50% of the time. the rest of the time, i couldn't make out anything. also without any context to the photos- time of day, type of camera, moisture in the room, dust particles (which 75% are what the orbs are), weather and a ga-gillion other factors, i cant accept them. i also cant help thinking that some might be doctored.why would that band keep the numbers from the door? vandalism? also during the taps investigation, they tried to dig up the death certificates of those nurses- and they only found one which was ruled "accidental" (people didn't want to officially proclaim suicide). yet when one of the guides was mentioning this, he said "yep, and its marked suicide." it really felt like the guides to the haunted houses here in october.i did however like the interviews with the patients and staff from the old hospital(s), that really gave it a lot of perspective and a personal touch. i'm also glad that they mentioned that the staff had the best of intentions, and weren't some ghoulish-wardens. they weren't the best methods, but its all they had. they were desperate to stop the disease.

i am very into waverly hills and first watched death tunnel the movie.couldn't have been much worse. then i heard that the documentary was coming out and got excited thinking that since it was a documentary it would be more serious and not have the horrible special effects.wrong the same guys did the documentary and ruined it with effects instead of producing it raw the way a documentary should be.waverly hills doesn't need help with goofy effects its fine just the way it is. tours are $20.00 per person and $100.00 for 8 hour overnight investigation per person minimal group of 10 for overnight investigation.tours must be set up ahead of time. awesome place for the ghost hunter!

let me preface by stating that i have lived in louisville, kentucky all of my life. i grew up about ½ mile from waverly. in the wintertime we would pull our sleds down maryman road and cross dixie highway to go sleigh riding on waverly hill. many times during the winter of 76-77 we would climb into the tunnel to warm ourselves. the place was still being run as a "geriatric center" at the time. we would go all the way through the tunnel up the hill to bang on what we thought was the "door to the morgue". i have to be honest. the only sensation we felt was that we were getting away with something we should not be doing. i would have to say we went up that tunnel over 50 times that winter. nothing stranger than teen-aged boys acting stupid ever happened. i love the fact that it is getting attention after all these years. one evening when i was young we looked out our front porch and it appeared that the entire hill was on fire. there was an older hospital on the hill that burned down. it burned for hours while the entire neighborhood sat outside and watched. the thing that gets lost about waverly is that many people survived tb there. let's face itthe doctors back then did everything they thought was correct to save people. it took a lot of guts for people to work there knowing how contagious tb was. too much is focused on those who suffered. i also have traveled into the building several times in the early 70's. we would go and visit shut-ins in the nursing home through a church youth group. by the way, the doors there were not prison like steel doors with chains and padlocks as portrayed in the film. they were wooden and opensometimes too open. it did smell of urine and feces and you saw the occasional open gown associated with patients with dementia. it was true that it was closed by the state in the early 80's. a lot of that may have to do with the age of the building or the right guy wasn't paid off. this is after all kentucky. the part of the documentary that turned me off the most was the piling of bodies into a cart. if i am not mistaken it appears to have been holocaust footage. that was added for dramatic effect. it left me with a sour taste in my mouth for the filmmaker. i am a skeptic when it comes to "ghosts". i do believe that many around here truly think the place to be haunted. waverly for me however symbolized a fun place for adventure for a boy with a sled.

i love watching a good gory giallo. unfortunately, solange is definitely not one of them. it's long. very long. the story is tacky and makes very little sense even if it's very obvious. the script spends so much time on the killings and the girls but it spends almost no time at all on the killer. this leaves a big hole in the story: we might get to see a bunch of young women showering together but we get zero characterization of why the killer decided to murder those girls. yes, what happened to solange is terrible but we still pretty much left in the dark over when, why did the [boring] killer decided that it was worth going through the effort of offing those oh so naughty girls. it's all so contrived that i couldn't get into it one bit.as for the look of the film, again, boring. nothing memorable about it. the actors? boring. the script? laughably boring. the whole "torrid" love affair between the teacher, the blond and the student was really embarrassing. what planet are they living on? the music? boring. skip it.

solange is not a great italian thriller. get ready for the spoiler - the main suspect, the professor, didn't do it. but is it really a spoiler? no, because you know that he couldn't have been the murderer from the very beginning; he and a student witnessed the first murder. so, there is absolutely no suspense as to whether or not the professor is the killer. there is a long, tedious build up to the final explanation of the mystery. the solution is interesting, but it comes out of nowhere. the rest of the movie (and it's not a short movie) is just not exciting enough to hold your interest. even in the tradition of "wrong man accused" it fails, because the police never seriously accuse the professor, and the killer is never after him. dull, dull, dull.

first off just to say i didn't get the edition i thought i would - i chose the italian version over the r2, but what actually arrived was a uk release from 1998 - claiming to be a special edition - i never knew there was a uk dvd release - but the promised biogs were not actually on the disc - just a couple of duff trailers. anyway - as to the film itself - just as i was recovering from "night train murders" my second genital mutilation thriller turns up in the same month - this time in (an italian) uk nubile schoolgirls are being offed and teacher fabio testi - (unhappily) married but nailing one of his students - becomes the main suspect. joachim fuchsberger is the detective on the case. sorry to say i was less than entranced. it was watchable but more than equally miss able,and aside from the aforementioned gruesome nature of the crime, the "surprise" killing of cristina galbo which was actually "spoilt" by the dvd cover telling me about it - grrrrrr!!!! and a surprise twist that cast the "victims" in a new light - i thought this was very routine. itwont put me off the two "sequels" though. with karin (hannibal brooks)baal and camille (i spit on your grave") keaton.

i've just seen this film in a lovely air-conditioned cinema here in bangkok. and since the temperature outside is hovering somewhere around 37c with very high humidity, my 100bt was not wasted.failing that, i haven't seen such a piece of extremely well-made junk in a long time. this is the kind of film that provides a test of taste, as it were. anyone who claims to like or love it goes immediately onto the same list of tasteless phonies who still go around talking about the superiority of british television. at least the gormless old broad in the wheelchair was good for a few guffaws.pseudo-profundity and fat lips, while characteristic of much french cinema, really do not a good movie make. i'd rather watch independence day 10 times in a row than sit through this stinker one more time.

i only bought this dvd because it was dirt cheap and it seemed interesting in its own special way ("special" meaning "retarded"). the movie turned out to be quite uninteresting - boring camera work, nothing really driving the story, and of course the acting is horrible. it wasn't even "bad" in a campy way - it was just plain bad. there are actually a handful of great lines of dialogue but for the most part its awkward and weak. all i could think about while watching this was that this could actually be a good movie if the script was given a major overhaul (if it were written by someone who actually understood drug culture) and if some decent actors were cast. i wouldn't recommend "weekend with the babysitter" unless if you plan on a career in film and want to learn what not to do in a movie.

this movie is not worth the time it takes to put it in the vcr or dvd player! michael dudikoff and lisa howard are two bounty hunters in love, yet they are total opposites. she is ambitious and organized, while he is laid back and totally scatter brained.in this movie, bad guys are chasing jersey bellini (dudikoff's character). this opens the door to bad godfather impressions, ludicrous fight scenes, and tony curtis playing the most effeminate looking mob boss i have ever seen! the ending has to be the most...unbelievable scene i have seen in a movie in quite some time. i would believe the terminator, even the matrix, has a better chance of possibly being true than this ending! this movie just reeks of cheapness. the script had to have hit someone as being totally ridiculous. yet, the green light was given for this piece of dung to be made and let loose on on unsuspecting public. i watched this movie with several other people who all agreed that we had been cheated. no one in the group could say anything good about the film except that it was over.

love sublime says the title. another blurb during the promotions of the film talked about inner vs external beauty. well in this case the beauty - you decide inner or external - is provided by scantily clad (or is that scantily dressed/ undressed) zeenat aman who the director raj kapoor called "a volcano of talent" while the film was being made. one can't accuse him of sarcasm of course - after all he was promoting his own film.the paper thin plot is about a woman with a disfigured face who has a - er - well proportioned body , a great voice (thanks to lata mangeshkar) with whom the hero shashi kapoor falls in love. he doesn't want her face only her voice. the acting is desperate and even the 4 is because of the music with lata mangeshkar giving some good numbers. the rest is of course bunkum. avoid - save your money. inner beauty vs outer beauty. !!! you need not be an einstein to figure out which one the director was concentrating on

aussie shakespeare for 18-24 set.with blood ,blood and more blood.and good dose of nudity. this will not be for every one on may levels, to violent for some too cheap for most. done on low budget they try and do there best but it only works sporadically.and this macbeth just seem to be lacking ,its just not compelling. although there is some good acting on the part of most you don't get into there heads especially mecbeths. the best performance came from gary sweet and the strangest mick molly. if your into shakespeare then see it,but if you like your cheese mature you will love it.it not a bad film but it not that good either. sam peckenpah would of loved it, that is if it was filmed as a western. i was expecting a lot from this, as i loved romper stomper. but this is was a vacant effort.

why a film maker with a track record like wes craven would want to lend his name to a tedious collection of cliches like this is anyone's guess. and if he did stump up any money for it - all of £50 judging by the looks - he should have been banging on the director's door for a refund the minute the film was released. there are many "alien" rip-offs and this is one of the worst. even the reliable lance henriksen, saddled with a character dumb enough to allow his kids to wander around a dangerous government lab, can't save it. as a cure for insomnia, this rates a 10+. as a piece of quality film making - forget it.

spoiler!!!! mind ripper hmmmm.... i had just watched the nightmare on elm street movies and had just found out about giovanni ribisi. i thought giovanni ribisi hadnt done any horrors so i checked into it. i saw "the outpost" (mind ripper) i checked on my tivo for it. there was an air date on sci fi. so i was set. i got my pop corn ready came in and set on the couch and what the hell is this? a freakin bold guy in blue sweat pants running around yelling! nothing is scary about this movie at all! if anything its funny! funny how low the budget is, funny how predictable it is, funny how bad the acting is and funny how much money it didnt make. ok giovanni ribisi is a good actor but this movie is dumb. it is so stupid. they killed him at the end and then they go on this plane and the "monster" is on it. they shoot him in the head with a shotgun and it falls a long way to the ground. and-gasp- the killer ending, its still alive! woohhh! scary! woooohhhh! sucky fat sack of crap waste of 2 hours.bottom line: you have somewhere to go and you need to kill some time. mind ripper isnt the suggestion. i'd rather sit out naked in the snow than watch this movie a second time.overall grade: f- - - - - - - - - - (enternal)

i really loved the millenium series, starred by lance henriksen, which is why i bought the film. obviously at some level it was a mistake. mutant/monster films are usually very bad and this film is no exception.the basic idea itself is not totally judged to fail (well nevertheless this film would never have been a success, even with a good director & actors), but the way it turns out this is just a b-class movie. the scenes that are supposed to be scary seem more funny to me and the critter is not credible at all.however, watching this film with group of friends in restless mood makes this film shine as it is so unintentionally hilarious.

the only reason i saw this movie was because it had giovanni ribisi and it was supposed to be "horror". don't be fooled, this movie has to be the worst "horror" film i have seen. it's about these people who go to a secret location which has a "monster" in it. the monster is a man with a deformed face running around in blue sweat pants who has a craving for brains. some people die, some people don't. in the end they throw the monster off of a plane and then fly away happily. but oh no! the monster is still alive after falling out of a plane! go spend 2 hours some other way like watching paint dry on a wall, trust me, it's more entertaining than this crap.

a 'wes craven presents' movie from 1995, directed by joe clayton and starring lance henriksen. a group of scientists save a dying man they find by their desert stranded government outpost by injecting him with their experimental virus, of course, one of their colleagues goes overboard and the virus transforms the man into a near unstoppable monster with them trapped inside. lance henriksen plays the morally offended researcher who leaves the project before all this, but returns after receiving a call for help to save the man (pre-unstoppable death machine mutation).deciding to combine two trips in one he brings his family along with him (they're going on vacation afterwards) and proceeds to give them entry to the top secret government facility, thus putting them right in the middle of the chaos within. in case you can't tell, this one relies on the viewer to work with it a little and put aside some petty (see: major and blatant) details.overall though: watch-able with mild bits of enjoyment. note: the outpost is commonly known under the title 'mind ripper'

i truly was disappointed by this film which i had high hopes for. it seems to have been rushed out to take advantage of the success of screwball comedies at the time (including mgm's own "libeled lady", which featured two of the same stars) and the success of william powell and myrna loy. three years into their pairing, they were still attractive to watch and filled with fire in their scenes together, but a weak screenplay and rushed premise destroys any chance of it being a great followup to the previous year's "libeled lady" and the two "thin man" movies they had done prior to this. "double wedding" tells the story of a clothing store manufacturer, myrna loy, who is intent on dominating the life of her sister (florence rice), future brother-in-law (john beal), and her own servants (which include sidney toler and mary gordon). when the independent spirited william powell comes into her life, having distracted rice and beal from loy's constant control, loy meets her match. sounds good so far, right? yeah, an interesting premise falls short, sad to say, because loy's character is so one dimensional it is hard to even like her let alone see powell fall in love with her, which we know will soon happen. it's another attempt to put a career minded woman in her place by changing her views on her what kind of life she has been leading, something hollywood did often during its golden age. when loy says she doesn't have time to both run her business and have a man in her life, its a groaner.fortunately, other than powell, there is free-spirited jessie ralph on board. a salty wealthy older woman who helped loy start her business, she has an acquaintance with powell and can see immediately through loy's cool claims that she loathes him. rice and beal are a boring couple, and the whole premise of powell getting between them is senseless. then, an ex-wife of powell's shows up, which really isn't necessary at that late point in the story, and the final wedding scene (where a crowd of people try to get into powell's tiny trailer) is a weak attempt to bring some farce. (it is funny though, that powell keeps getting hit by items meant by loy to hit edgar kennedy with; those chuckles are most welcome, since there are so few others.) powell and loy would do better in two later screwball comedies, "i love you again" and "love crazy", which are sophisticated, witty, and fun. this film attempts to be all three, but ends up a sophisticated bore.

i had looked forward to viewing this movie, it seemed anyone who had seen it loved it. i was completely disappointed. the acting was so overdone. the script seemed like the writer had gathered 25 different scripts from various movies and randomly chose dialogue and pieced them together to form one plagarized script.spoilers: was any cliche omitted in this movie? there was a mobstyle hit, homosexuality, prostitution, a serial killer, a fire, numerous godfather wannabees, the main character in love with the prostitute, cross dressing, torture by the police, hannibal lechter style mutilations, i could go on and on.line's like (the godfather wannabe to the prostitute)-"ben senin arik calismani istemiyorum" (i don't want u to work anymore)-"ben calismasam kirayi kim odeyecek?" (who would pay the rent if i didn't work)unrealistic scenes: we never saw a single policeman during the serial killer scenes, yet when the main character disappeared his father was taken in by the police and tortured for weeks.the only way i can make sense out of this whole movie, is if the version i had scene was severely edited from the original. i definitely do not recommend it, and would greatly enjoy discussing it further with anyone who would care to do so.

this movie has the feel of a college project over it, who wants to do a blair witch project meets saw theme. but it isn't successful. the cinematography is poor, and the acting even more so. the characters, in my opinion doesn't come off as being credible at all. the editing of the film isn't really working as intended either. there are a lot of poor effects, which i believe are put in there to try and add a horrid effect. but to me it just gives me a feeling of indifference.i would stay away from this movie, unless you are a dedicated movie freak, who likes to watch "different" and indie "horror" movies. however, i believe this movie is not worth watching, for the average person. you will get no pleasure out of the poor effects, and the handycam feel, which this movie bestows on it's viewers.

i have to start out by saying that the actresses and actor did a fine job for what they worked with. the problem in dark reality is you had a poor director who tried so hard to be innovative and evocative he ended up trashing up the film. from start to finish you can tell the film reel quality itself is low, but the poor lightning and shaky camera only hurt it further by obscuring what is going on. the sound is muffled and often times not understandable. i'm sure huston (the director) would argue this was to induce a state of panic in the audience, but he had more than ample material in which to do it. having to result to camera and lighting the way he did was a sign of over the top syndrome.the story is good. a basic sadistic female kidnapper story that avoids cliché by keeping the girl's in a state of despair the whole time for good reason. billy bob from silence of the lambs treated his victims better than netwon. the biggest problem with the story is that dead people constantly harass the lead character in her mind, and by the second time they showed up i was fast forwarding as this was attempting to destroy the only decent part of the film.in the end, the way the director pieced it together showing random blurry things and constant barely viewable scenes (not because of horror, because of the lighting, angles, and camera) ultimately destroyed this film. huston was obviously trying too hard and if anything it resembled a bad film school project. if you want to see a decent story then it's all right, but be warned the film quality is enough for most to turn it off.

8 days no script that's what the dvd tells you is how the movie was made. it's shot in blurry video that's occasionally used to good effect, but it's really partially naked women sitting around in a room for most of the running time. it is very well acted and this helps a lot. but the killer only shows up once in a long time and the girls/women sit and mope they don't try to escape or do anything too interesting, so the whole thing grinds to a stand still after about 20 minutes. would have been a good short maybe even powerful. even for eight days they do very little. why? because they had no script. how many movies have been made without scripts. not too many. i wonder why that is? how many great movies have been made from bad scripts. not too many. why is that? working against this major problem, the direction tries and does some interesting things but with what is essentially nothing. topless girls shot in dark grainy colorless video sitting around will keep some going for a while but not for the short but too long feature length. actors again deserve praise, if only there was a script.also the video quality, or lack thereof, is really low end, they try to use it to advantage and at times some shots look they are from miami vice, the recent movie that is. but that's not intended to compliment miami vice or this failed venture.

dark reality is a saw like movie that is slightly decrepit. while the plot and story are good, there is a little too much unnecessary nudity. while i feel the film was technically well done, the acting was spotty, it was just a little too dark for my mood while i was watching it. it basically says that there are a lot of missing people out there that will never be found and are perhaps being tortured by sick whackos. i feel that some information on the captors and their reasons for being so sick would have helped some. it came of as a snuff film, just made for the violent content. if you like to see women beaten, tortured, and killed then this is for you. if you're looking for something a little liter and more expressive and reasoned, skip this one.

you have to hand it to writer-director john hughes. with enormous success behind him in the misfit-teenager/high school vein, he managed to branch out into other areas of comedy, finding in the bargain a great ally in comedian-actor john candy. here, goof-off adult candy becomes a better person after agreeing to babysit his brother's wiseacre kids; it's a surefire formula designed to please both cynical teens as well as their parents, and it isn't any wonder the film was a winner with theater audiences. still, hughes relies almost completely on candy's charm to put the scenario over, and one may eventually grow tired of the repetitious gags with the star front and center. the kids are sitcom-smart, the other adults shapeless blobs, and amy madigan is too intense, too hyped-up playing uncle buck's girlfriend. later became a tv series, which is befitting since the material was already television-perfected. *1/2 from ****

i'm seeing a pattern here. if you see a movie on mystery science theater 3000, chances are if you go to imdb.com there will be hordes of lovers of the film, yet it was picked to be on that tv show because it was sooo bad. i'm sorry but i read a lot about rocketship x-m as being some landmark sci fi film that stressed realism. well if that is the case i could write for several paragraphs about how even with 1950's knowledge this movie is utterly flawed. gravity might be the first obvious observation, or as mst3k did as a skit "selective gravity", also what about when they are plunging to their death and they are just standing there looking out of the window, um would'nt the ship being upside down effect that scene? i would like to think that they started with good intentions and that it ran over budget or something but i think this movie was just plain cheese as in the from under type. just compare this to "when worlds collide" which was released in 1951 to see the true place where this movie ranks, there's no comparison. the movie gets a 2 or maybe 3 on its own, its not even funny to watch on its own. it gets about a 5 or 6 as a mst3k episode as there is no action or much to make fun of, just bad, bad, bad, oh did i mention, it's bad.

i completely understand the historical significance of rocketship x-m, but that doesn't make it a good movie. to begin with, the plot (or what there is of it) is dull and lifeless. five astronauts blast off for the moon  they get knocked off course and end up on mars (huh?)  cavemen-looking martians throw rocks at them  they return to earth and meet a fiery death  the end. believe it or not, but this pithy plot description makes it sound much more interesting than it really is. to make matters worse, john emery's character, dr. karl eckstrom, feels it necessary to give long drawn out speeches on everything from the nature of man to the dangers of nuclear weapons. it's just a thrill-a-minute (sarcasm intended).looking back at rocketship x-m almost 60 years later, i would call the portrayal of women funny if it weren't all so sad and misguided. there are a number of examples i could cite, but there's one exchange of dialogue just after take-off between the male chauvinist pilot floyd (played by the irritating, plastic-haired lloyd bridges) and dr. lisa van horn (the only female crewmember and the constant object of floyd's often creepy attention) that illustrates the film's attitudes toward women quite nicely:  floyd: "i've been wondering, how did a girl like you get mixed up in a thing like this in the first place."  dr. van horn: "i suppose you think that women should only cook and sew and bear children."  floyd: "isn't that enough?" i think floyd should have stayed behind with the cavemen!

to call "rocketship x-m" a science fiction classic is due more to its release date (1950), its savvy ability to capitalize on the publicity for "destination moon", and the appearance of actors who would later star in television as sea hunt's mike nelson, rockford's dad and wyatt earp.the movie itself is bad enough to be good fodder for mst3k and is best viewed with commentary from joel and the robots. this is the type of movie best suited to added riffing from the mst3k characters; something preachy, slow-paced, poorly scripted, and full of painfully bad acting. while unintentionally funny stuff like "plan 9 from outer space" don't lend themselves to satirical commentary (because the movie constantly upstages the hosts), really bad and dull movies like "rocketship x-m" are ideal. so add some stars to the rating if you are watching the mst3k version.the basic story has the crew taking an unplanned right turn at the moon and ending up on mars. what they find on that planet are the remnants of a human-like civilization devastated by an atomic war. only one martian is shown in close-up, a normal looking woman who is blind or at least has no pupils in her eyes. the men look like the "goons" in the old popeye cartoons, they scamper agilely around the cliffs and throw boulders at the crew with amazing accuracy-especially if they are supposed to be blind. of course none of this is ever explained as doing so would require some sign of logical analysis from the writers of the screenplay.the scenes on mars are presented in something called "sepia color" to distinguish them from the rest of the b&w movie. if this has you thinking "wizard of oz" you will be disappointed because it is just black and white stuff with a slight brown tint added to the print in post-production.in keeping with the moronic sexism of the movie, the icy female scientist screws up her fuel calculations-both coming and going. her failure to measure up to the men causes her feminine side to surface and she and mike nelson coo sweetly to each other as they face their doom (insert sound of gagging here).the real stars of the movie are the reporters at the command center. so much so that mst3k was inspired to specially salute these unheralded heroes. the intrepid squad of "newsies" are featured for the first 10 minutes of the movie, then take stations about 12 inches behind the technicians and monitoring equipment in the command center. later they are called upon to ask the moronic questions needed by the mission director to expound on the movie's already too obvious message.the dvd has an extremely low audio level, is not captioned, and is accompanied by a trailer. although you will be thankful that it is only 77 minutes, it is still about 60 minutes too long as any 30 minute episode of "the twilight zone" has several times more content than this entire movie.then again, what do i know? i'm only a child.

although it can be very tedious at times, this movie is really not all that bad. the acting is fairly well done, if stereotypical, and the production values are pretty high considering some of the sci-fi movies that were to come later in the decade.my biggest problem with this film are some of the very outdated characterizations in it. there's the guy from texas, the "professional" scientist, and worst of all the woman scientist who finally realizes her womanhood. for a film seeking to make a statement about mankind, it loses some of it's impact by reducing its characters through sexist stereotypes.

i bought "rocketship x-m" on dvd in a two-pack with "destination moon." now i see why the distributors did that: no one who had ever seen this movie would buy it on its own.i cannot fathom what school system turned out the reviewer who claimed that rxm is "great in its predictions of how space travel would take place..." launch straight up, and then do a 90-degree right turn and circle faster and faster until you reach escape velocity... i don't think i recall that from the apollo program. never mind that the astronauts should be weightless once they shut off the engines, gravity changes directions every time they pass through the hatch to the engine room. going to the moon, but "missed" it? no problem, it's just a hop-skip-and-a-jump (with a helping hand from divine providence) and you'll be at mars! and ok, if you want to put life on mars, given the state of planetary knowledge in 1950, it was a forgivable convention for the sake of the storytelling, but can you make them look at least a little alien? these martians looked like extras from the cast of "10,000 b.c." i can accept some scientific mistakes, but this wouldn't pass muster with an above-average second-grader.and that's aside from the screaming plot holes: 12 minutes before launch (as you're reminded of constantly by the nagging p.a. voice saying "x minus so many minutes") the astronauts are giving a press conference! i guess the time crunch is why dr. eckstrom didn't change out of his coat and tie before launching into space. and how handy that, even though they were planning to go to the moon and had pressure suits for that, they brought hiking gear (and rifles!) just in case they ended up at mars. they're lucky they landed anywhere, since apparently the method they had developed for landing was to have dr.e look out the window and tell the "pilot" (lloyd bridges) to tweak down the throttles every now and then. note to the designers of the xm-2: how about giving the pilot a window seat? ditto the previous comments on the casual sexism that had eye-candy dr. lisa (osa massen) doom them all by repeatedly screwing up her fuel calculations, but hey that was the early '50s. she was there to fill her sweater, not a useful function."rocketship x-m" is notable for being one of the first of the first films to say "ohmigod we're all going to blow ourselves up with these here a-bombs", but one can note that about it without wasting 77 minutes watching such dreck. by the way, that message might have had a bit more impact had there been some money in the budget for actual sets of the martian city ruins, rather than just matte paintings.i can appreciate "good" bad sci-fi, for the unique way the "future" used to look, and for the inherent (if condescending) humor you can find when when we look back on the naivety of audiences 60 years ago, but this film must have been insulting even then. "rocketship x-m" isn't even suitable for an mst3k-style lampooning. sometimes, bad is just... bad.anybody want to buy a dvd? used only once, i swear.

minor spoilersfirst i must say how rare and charming it is to find a movie with such basic messages in it: nuclear war will inevitably destroy all of civilization, and women are for making babies. it is absolutely incredible how well formulated the plot is to hit in these two points, as with a golden hammer. essentially, everything about this movie annoyed me. the casual sexism, the character whose sole trait was coming from texas, the mysterious choice of dying mars orange, and of course the flawed science of it all. then the martian woman screaming as if she had just noticed that she was blind? what was that? however, i will give it credit. the fifties did spit out some sillier things. but not much...

wow, this was a real stinker. this early sci-fi flick has nothing going for it than pure camp. there's so much scientific mambo-jumbo in the dialog it's laughable. the female character played by osa massen is just a plot device for the male characters to serve sexist remarks during the entire length of the film. watch this one with your girlfriend i guarantee it will make her blood boil.the only good thing is the musical score which expertly build the moods of the film. the special-effects are rather crude but not bad considering the vintage of the movie. with some good b-stars in the lead roles,the acting isn't too bad. but the lines they are given must have given them quite a challenge. the challenge of not laughing their heads off.

i like this movie and have watched my copy twice since acquiring it a few weeks ago. but you have to view it in the right context.i haven't checked on the dates, but i bet this movie came out after and certainly around the same time as the collier and walt disney popularisations of the vision of spaceflight being promoted by w.von braun. this is reflected in the attempt to seem factually correct and scientific. however, whilst certain ideas are put across ( step boosters, for example ) roughly correctly, other things are hilariously wrong.for example, we are told that a rocket ascends to an altitude and then turns ninety degrees to enter space...like reaching the top of a flight of stairs and turning onto the landing! then we are told that by turning in the direction of the earths rotation the total velocity of the ship is increased accordingly.this is an hilarious misunderstanding of what really happens. most space launch centres are located as near the equator as possible where the earth and anything on its surface is rotating at roughly a thousand miles per hour, including any rocket departing to space, in an eastward direction ( the same as the rotation of the planet ). of course, if the ship turned to travel westwards once in space, its speed in relation to the surface of the earth would be greater, but it would add nothing to the actual velocity of the vehicle. decsribed in this movie as "air speed"! similarly, we are told that the travellers only feel free-fall, or "weightlessness" when they reach some thousands of miles from the earth, outside of the planets gravitational field. again, comically incorrect. most crewed spacecraft travel no higher than a couple of hundred miles up, but as long as they ( and, their contents, including crew ) are travelling at an adequate velocity that their momentum in an outward direction balances the pull of gravity inwards, they will orbit in free-fall. of course, travel far enough from earth and even a slow object will coast outside the earths gravity well, but in order to leave earth orbit, outwards ( towards the moon for example ) requires the attainment of "escape velocity", around twenty one thousand miles per hour. so the vehicle will have already attained "orbital velocity" ( and "weightlessness" ) by definition.but the movie has vastly more hilarious stuff than this. someone decided it would be more fun if they missed the moon due to a technical problem, fell asleep for a few days and then woke up to find they had accidentally gone to mars! the captain then ruminates to the effect that this must have been divine intervention! at which point, any pretence to being scientific is torn into little pieces like confetti and thrown upon the wind amid the merry dance of an increasingly barmy plot.the strength of a film like this in fact is in illustrating "how far we've come". not least in attitudes to women. the patronising drivel heaped upon the female crew-member is both hilarious and also shocking.to think that such attitudes were so recently "normal".as i said at the start, i find this film very entertaining, as a late night, lights out romp through the romance of travel in outer space, from the perspective of the days before it had actually happened. an antidote to the cold routine of spaceflight as it has now become in the twenty first century.i won't reveal the ending. it is both brave and shocking for a movie of this vintage and character.

i first saw this when it came out in the theater. though only 13 at the time, i was an avid reader of "hard science" science fiction stories. the technical gaffes of the film are burned into my memory.some of the following may have significant spoilers.even as a youngster, i knew the premise is silly. the rocket takes off for a lunar mission, in a cosmos where there is always a gravitational effect on the crew (though loose objects float as in zero gravity) and because of that, the "cabin" (the area with the controls, whatever they called it) was gyrostabalized to maintain the "correct" orientation (so that when they landed, why didn't they land standing on their heads?) and where, at least in near-earth space, the rocket engines had to be running continually -- with propellant combusting away without an oxidizer. when the engines quit, the rocket stopped _dead_ in space, and couldn't start going until a phd chemist determined it needed at a little oxidizer. this time, the rocket recalled it had momentum, and the next thing our heroes know they're near mars (even a 13-year-old nerd knew such a minimum-energy trip would take over 200 days).they land, find the air was breathable (though at the time scientific data revealed that the pressure, even if the atmosphere were pure oxygen, would be too low to do any good). they decide to camp outside the ship, and even build a campfire. they come armed, even though they were supposedly going to the moon, where firearms wouldn't be needed.they get a sight of a collapsed civilization, encounter stray martians who look just like people, develop an anti nuclear war philosophy, and those who survive try to get back to the home planet, and die in the attempt by crashing on the earth! to do that would require such a long orbital period, they'd have died of starvation long before approaching their destination.the film it preceded, destination moon, used real science most effectively (even though their "rescue" with the oxygen tank forgot about the moment arm from the tank's center of gravity to the output nozzle). this film showed woeful ignorance of even the most basic science. only the most technologically illiterate should think of it as a science fiction film: it's on a par with the old flash gordon serials where their rocketships took off from their bellies and climbed in spirals, and whose engines were always on.the story on this one i considered banal, and i can recommend this only as a film to be shown to students for them to pick out technical gaffes.

rocketship x-m should be viewed by any serious movie buff for the following reasons:1) it is one the first -- and the few -- movies not to have a happy ending. doubtless the effect was more profound in post-world war ii america than it would be today, but nonetheless the sad ending adds to the film's message.2) it is also one of the first movies to deal with space travel in a serious fashion, using space as a valid setting for drama. the lack of scientific background notwithstanding, the movie stands on its own as dramatic fare. it's not so much a space drama as it is a drama set in space.3) the anti-nuclear war message is delivered in a serious manner that is not lost in sfx involving large grasshoppers, men, or animal. the effect of martian society from nuclear devastation is starkly and frankly presented. the fact that the survivors from the expedition crash land and as such are unable to preach the lesson learned on mars adds another element of sadness to the tragic ending.sterno says take a ride on rocketship x-m.

there is a phrase by the experimental filmmaker nathaniel dorsky, who says some films are structured like a camera mounted on the head of a dog who goes down an alley, sniffing everything along the way.that's how this movie is. the structure is "kurosawa started out as a baby, then he became a kid, then a young man, then a movie director, then he started making 'masterpieces', then he grew old, the end." the word 'masterpiece' is used a lot in this film to describe kurosawa's output, without explaining *what* makes his films so good/great. just because the off-screen narrator reading a script says that a film is a masterpiece, are we supposed to kiss his rear-end and accept that a certain movie is one of the great works of art of the 20th century? and one more point. the voice of paul scofield is used as the voice of kurosawa, when excerpts from the director's memoirs are being read off screen. he brings pear-shaped shakespearean tones to the text...but why him?? if you were making a documentary about billie holiday, would you use dame judi densch as her voice????

on the cusp of being insufferable. somehow i stayed just slightly interested, but was it because i truly wanted to know what the "secret" was (which, i should say, is pretty damned obvious) or because i hoped scarlett johansson would put on a more sexy outfit? this movie is poor and what's more it's a disgrace to all the lonely, alcoholic southern literature professors out there. travolta wants his oscar so bad he is willing to cry drunkenly in the bathroom after urinating blood. sorry, pal. . .you were more believable is "staying alive." not everyone can pull a peter fonda in "ulee's gold." if you want the against-type brave anti- hero oscar you have to, um, actually act. . .not just pout on screen. stop this director before he/she (name is vague on gender) directs again!

the director does not know what to do with a camera... too many options and she always always always picks the wrong one... she let travolta take charge... and he controls the movie from the beginning to the end... the characters are not developed... maybe because we need to watch them singing... no pace at all, sometimes too fast sometimes too slow... miscasted: travolta ok... johansson, she is too grown up to be a 18... even if she is really 20...the happy ending? well it looks like that there must be one, so the story is sad but not too sad... travolta doesn't know how to play a guitar but the director doesn't look she cares too much that he is totally out of synch... the idea is the only thing that is great... but how she developed it? well, it is simply full of stereotypes and lines heard too many times...too bad, another missed chance...

this overheated southern gothic "mellerdramer" has a few decent moments --but is too often spoiled by a novice director piling cliché upon cliché, and a star who apparently decided to take it upon himself to turn the picture into his personal showcase, rather than allowing writer/director gabel to update inge or williams as a sort of contemporary "midnight cowboy" meets "lolita" tearjerker.close your eyes, listen to the exaggerated southern accents, and try to decide if you're witnessing a feature film, or an acting class -- full of eager amateurs. johansson is for once tolerable (i.e. less pouty than usual) -- though by no means good, macht is decent, though a little too pretty-boy cute to be believed, and travolta chews the scenery as never before (with the help of a decent editor and some directorial restraint, his performance might have been really touching; as it is, he -- and almost everyone else -- is too unlikable to ever move us past the point of boredom or revulsion). kara unger is perhaps best of all; had her role been developed beyond a few lines, she might have even found herself with a best supporting actress nomination. pic is almost saved by leonard cohen-style growling theme song, decent production design and locations, and continual reference to literary works (which has earned the otherwise standard screenplay reviews such as "poetic.") also helpful are a few old pros in the cast like sonny shroyer, and perhaps most importantly, soderbergh cameraman elliot davis -- whose fine work will no doubt be credited to the first-time director, who, ten or twenty years from now, may actually learn how to direct.but probably not.

this movie is an incredibly self-indulgent character piece that assumes that the mere impression of a story is as good as an actual story. it was utterly painful to watch and had i not been suckered in to buy the dvd because of john travolta and the positive buzz, i would not have finished watching it.this film lacks anything resembling an interesting premise and seems to rely on weighty (and frankly, heavy-handed) characterization. there is one altercation scene between purslane and bobby long in which a tv is destroyed that, when played out, is incredibly flaccid and ill-timed.i found myself caring less and less about the characters as i watched it. it was probably very fun, film-school-wise, to make it. but it is just awfully boring to watch. a indulgent and pretentious film school project you should not waste money on.

what a waste. john travolta and scarlett johansen deserved better than this. to start at the beginning, jt was horribly miscast in the lead here. the role called for someone who could convince as a broken-down anti-hero, someone who could look haunted and defeated. billy bob thornton would have fit the bill, or even al pacino, but jt is just too alive, and looks to be having too much fun. also, surely someone who has been through the mill to the extent jt's character had would have suffered some physical effects? the character presented to the audience looked as if he could start as tight end for the oakland raiders. scarlett faired little better role-wise. where was the pain and conflict of what should surely have been troubling development? and as for the "plot" ... well, none of it makes sense. the characters leap from one frame of mind to another seemingly without cause - and certainly without explanation. the pace of the film also leaves something to be desired, namely, pace. this is a very slow film, not that i have anything against slow films, as long as they are heading somewhere. the pace only picks up towards the very end, when it shifts from a slow dirge to a frantic race to pack in as many tired clichés as possible. in this it succeeds - the only thing missing being something involving a small dog. 3 out of 10 for this one purely for gabriel macht's performance - he was the only member of the cast who was a) well cast and b) able to convince in his role. all in all, a terrible disappointment and a real waste of a couple of hours.

i attended a screening of this film. travolta came to do a q & a after the film ended. it was a small screening room in tribeca. out of courtesy to him i did not walk out which i wanted to do. this is film-making at its worst. to start the script was poorly written. the writer writes in one voice. the dialogue was stilted and clichéd. how this writer/director got scarlet johansen, john travolta and lions gate entertainment to back her on this is the only brilliant thing she accomplished in this fiasco.i do in fact recommend this film to all aspiring screenwriters, directors and filmmakers. because when you are told that you are wasting your time and it will be impossible for you to reach your goals. hey...just look at this crap and say to yourself...if they can make this then anythings poosible.ps- travolta did a great q&a though...he was at ease, spoke freely and was a down to earth nice guy. the director/writer stood on the sidelines. when john tried to engage her in the conversation she stood back like a piece of wood and never joined in. i looked at her and i thought...how was this person able to successfully "pitch" to agents, studio execs, top talent ...when she can't open her mouth at a screening of her own film. the conclusion from a few of us in attendance was that she must have strong family connections in the business.after you watch this you should follow it with guy ritchie's zero star masterpiece "swept away" with the most unintentionally funny and worst performance by wife madonna. she's so bad and looks so bad in this film i figure this was her his way of getting back at her for all the abuse he takes from her at home.

veber is not renown for his outstanding directorial skills. in fact nobody cares as long as they got the laughs, quite a few here to be honest, scattered in the whole process, thanks to depardieu's half-wit characterization and the dialogue veber puts in his mouth.but this is not enough to make a great comedy since there's no movie outside of the usual veber premise: a tough guy is doomed to team up with a very naive character. in l'emmerdeur, la chèvre or les compères there was a real story going on over the fire vs. water proceedings. le diner de cons, although it was a play, managed to create a real suspense about the next catastrophe pinon would cause. in tais-toi the backstory about the vengeance is both redundant and too weak to arouse our interest. plus the heavies are lame both on screen and in the script.now what's wrong? veber wraps this up creating no action, no rhythm. instead he uses systematically and overuses ellipses (maybe he met william goldman in hollywood) and the 'music' really stresses that lack of nerve and a backbone in the story.so you'll have to be content with depardieu's performance.

reading the other two comments, i had to wonder if i had seen the same movie!perhaps life is drastically different in australia, but, wow - call it sci-fi or fantasy, but people just don't act like this.i couldn't pass up this review without commenting on it myself.. it gets better after the first half hour, but i doubt most could make it that far..yikes.

the parallels between this film and "captain walrus" (an independant film shown at the team projection film festival in 1994) are so blindingly obvious that any praise for "sally marshall is not an alien" must be viewed with the knowledge that it is riding on the success of another work.in captain walrus, two young boys (geoff and roger, played by dean turner and brett allen respectively) examine the bizarre behaviour of their new neighbour britney (played by louise farley). as the two boys watch through their telescope, they observe the repeated visits of a man in uniform who they call captain walrus (played by peter sargent). however, the emphasis in captain walrus is on the pointless and somewhat power-hungry actions of the neighbour britney, and less on the friendship between the two boys.a critical success at the film festival, the plot of captain walrus has obviously been appropriated and rehashed in order to give the australian film community another notch on the belt with regards to children's product. although sally marshall is not an alien is a fine film, and a credit to its producers, its inauthenticity leaves something to be deserved.

in the past 5 years i have rented some bad movies...completely on purpose. see i aspire to be a movie reviewer, and as we all know there are horrible movies released every year. anyway, about 3 months ago i rented this one. i watched it all the way through...and cried profusely. this is one of those movies that is so freakin bad it makes you want to puke. it actually put a sick feeling in my stomach. i've seen lots of bad movies (mystery science theater 3000 anyone?) but this one takes the cake. the plot was hard to follow, the lighting horrible and the sounds almost inaudible. if there was a negative rating on the scale here this movie would be at -11 for me. this may seem odd, but i highly recommend it. it's something you have to see for yourself...but don't say i didn't warn you. i don't think this review could get any more precise so i'm done now.

i've heard that this move was put together by a bunch of high-school students. as a high-school art or theatre project it's not too bad. unless you lived near milpitas in the seventies or knew someone involved in the making of the movie, this is pretty awful. most of the actors are clearly not actors, but locals who volunteered. bob wilkins (the original host of creature features on ktvu in oakland appears, but only for about a minute). some of the monster effects are done with stop motion animation and some with a man in a monster suit and each works okay on it's own, but there is no continuity between the two. watching without dialog, you'd assume that the movie had 2 monsters. i guess the most unsupportable aspect is that even the main characters, who i assume are the kids behind the movie, cannot even pretend to act. these kids must have been involved in theater in some way to want to do this project, but they display zero believable emotion in front of the camera.

this is the result of the town of milpitas california making a home movie and subjecting the rest of the world to it. legendary in some circles as the biggest cinematic turkey this movie is rightly thought of as a bad movie. part comedy, part giant monster horror movie this movie is full of non actors not acting. the plot has something to do with a giant monster being created from the garbage and pollution in the area and going on a rampage. the monster, which we don't see until the final 20 minutes, is rather cool looking but isn't cool enough to warrant watching the preceding hour of boredom. frankly even hardened bad movie lovers are going to have a tough time getting through to the end. this is a stinker.

it is real easy to toast, roast, flay, and otherwise burn this film for all of its abundant flaws. it was made by high school students and faculty and a whole community; it shows! sure, i could examine the script which is just ridiculous. a monster created from the garbage of a growing californian city starts eating garbage and taking garbage cans all over the city. soon this huge beast with wings no less begins to destroy buildings and even plays the "beauty and the beast" act with a young high school girl. fortunately for her there is a gang of guys, her former boyfriend nicknamed "the penguin," and the town drunk out to help her. the direction is awful, the production values just dreadful, the acting non-existent, and the pace sluggish. the movie is hard to sit through - period. however, that being said, it is also a miracle of a film when you consider that this thing was crafted by an entire community. you can see all the collective effort from the actors, the actual mayor and actual firemen and policemen, to the area location shots used. i also was really amazed at all the local businesses credited at the film's end with helping to finance or contribute in some way to the film. when you look at the film from that perspective, it is indeed quite an achievement. i didn't know anything about it before i sat down and watched it. now that i have found out something about it, i am impressed. but make no mistake - i have no...no...desire to sit through it again.

this is a very bad movie. however, i read that it was made by a high-school teacher so maybe i should give it at least a tiny bit of praise for it's ambitious (yet awful) special effects. here is the plot: a monster emerges from a pile of trash and pollution in the town of milpitas, california and embarks on a destructive rampage. i'm about to spoil the "big surprise" about what the monster looks like, so please read the rest of this at your own risk. you have been warned! the monster looks sort of like a giant, two-legged fly wearing a gas mask. in some scenes, the monster is an actor wearing a costume. in other scenes, the monster is created by stop-motion animation. the acting is terrible. the dialogue is terrible. the special effects are terrible. the plot is predictable. stay away!

i'm giving it a three instead of the lower number it deserves because of its history. a full-length movie made by high school students! it shows, too, but that's part of the charm and appeal. get ahold of some of the stuff george lucas did at ucla; this is better. maybe due to being a group effort.a monster made of toxic waste and too much garbage--these kids were way ahead of their time!--starts ravaging the town of milpitas during a high school dance. the monster destroys randomly, leaving garbage and smelly footprints.the movie has local tv and radio people, the milpitas mayor, the samuel ayer high school principal, and a whole bunch of the high school students and their parents, not to mention the mayor's daughter as the ingénue.dumb? yeah! fun? yeah! great screen writing? c'mon, they're untrained high schoolies! copy that comment for the acting, cinematography, directing, et cetera.milpitas is right next to san jose in the heart of silicon valley; maybe one of the graphics geniuses there will update the video somehow. now there's a challenge.

if corky st. claire in waiting for guffman had directed the citizens of blaine in a horror movie with comic undertones the result would have been very much like the milpitas monster.to be generous, this was the longest hour and twenty minute movie i've ever seen. to call the pace glacial is to be kind.almost nobody associated with this project ever made another movie with the exception of ben burtt, who did the really admirable (considering the budget) special effects. he went on to do sound for movies like munich and several other big budget projects. the narration is by veteran voice-over actor paul frees, who probably donated his efforts.when you're watching the opening titles and see the milpitas unified school district listed as one of the producers you know you're going on a long, strange trip.pollution at the down dump in milpitas, california, becomes so toxic that it creates a monster. remember that this is 1975 and ecology was a hot topic. just a few years previously moviegoers had been treated to godzilla vs. the smog monster.so far so good. the monster is a winged creature at least fifty feet tall and has the capacity to tear the town apart. instead it steals garbage cans.central to the premise is the idea that this monster can prowl a small city and leave eight foot long footprints behind but not be noticed by anyone. there's a nicely conceived scene where it walks through the middle of a carnival at night but somehow nobody notices.the only person who sees the monster until the final scenes is george, the town drunk. all through the movie i hoped, hoped, hoped that george would be torn to shreds on camera but this didn't happen. drat. in fact, nobody gets killed. george supposedly sacrifices himself to save priscilla (he's tied to a helicopter to lure the creature- george smells worse than garbage and the monster is attracted to the scent).the nominal leads are a group of high school students. there's pretty priscilla and her nondescript boyfriend and some "bad" boys who (surprise, surprise) whip themselves into shape to help defeat the monster in the final scenes.the monster is involved in four main set pieces. he attacks a browning-ferris garbage truck and leaves it beside an elevated highway, but nobody notices. he walks through the carnival, again unnoticed. he tears up a building (nice miniature work) and nobody sees him but george. then he attacks the high school during a dance and grabs priscilla and carries her off just like a certain very tall ape has done several times, most recently this past winter.there are plot ideas that come out of nowhere and are dropped. local citizens picket at city hall because they want their garbage cans back. an elaborate secret weapon for tracking monsters is flown in by private jet, examined, and forgotten.so why did i watch the whole thing? because these people were having so darned much fun. i had the idea that the firemen were firemen, the businessmen were being filmed in their own offices, priscilla may well live in that suburban tract house, and scenes of people in their yards may well have been in their own yards.they may not be great actors, but they are real people. nobody is stunningly good looking. in fact, i'd estimate that four out of five of the adults on screen wear glasses. since this is the mid seventies we see some really bad clothes and some of the men have awesomely bad facial hair. one dignitary being interviewed before a meeting at ciry hall has such a loud tie and sportcoat that you think he's on his way to play marcellus in the music man.and that got the movie two extra stars. zero for the story. two points for the sometimes decent special effects. and two points for the fact that people in the community actually got together and did this. they can actually say they've performed in a movie; despite lots of stage experience and working behind the scenes in live television i can't say that, and i'm happy for them.remember those great old movies with mickey rooney and judy garland? at some point somebody would say, "let's put on a show! aunt edna has all those old clothes in the attic, and we can use uncle ned's barn!" then they'd do 'neighborhood shows' with sets and costumes that would cost well into seven figures if duplicated today.that's the spirit that the good people of milpitas had for this project, and bless them for that.

so this guy goes into a psychiatrist's office for his first appointment. after the paperwork is done, the psychiatrist says "i'm going to show you ink blots. tell me what you see in them." "well, says the patient," looking at the first one, "i see a man and a woman having sex." on seeing the second one, he says "i see two women having sex." on seeing the third, he says "i see two men having sex." on seeing the next one, he says "i see two men and two women having sex." the psychiatrist puts down the the inkblots. "so," he says, "we'll start by discussing your monomania." "my monomania?" says the guy. "and you with all these dirty pictures!" that's how this movie strikes me.

awkward disaster mishmash has a team of scavengers coming across the overturned s.s. poseidon, hoping to loot it before it goes under for good. irwin allen's sequel to his 1972 blockbuster "the poseidon adventure" arrived in theaters seven years later! never mind that nobody cared anymore, why give us such a shoddy production, filled with dim characters and miscast actors, only to trash the memory of your biggest hit? one might end up feeling really sorry for michael caine, sally field, peter boyle, jack warden, karl malden and shirley jones were it not for their lost-at-sea expressions (good for a few stray laughs). there's a moment when saintly jones is tempted into taking some treasures just for herself and she timidly starts stuffing her pockets that is an unintended hoot. the film was a career bungler for all concerned, most especially allen, who never quite recovered from this. * from ****

wretched. talk about botched. beyond the poseidon adventure is bad in every respect. salvagers michael caine and karl malden decide to tow the wreck of the eponymous ocean liner with a really creaky tug boat. they're challenged by ruthless telly savalas and his gang of machine-gun toting goons. this part sequel, part remake has caine, malden and another group of poseidon survivors making a similarly dangerous trek out of the sinking ship. among this group are shirley jones, slim pickens, peter boyle, shirley knight and slim pickens. jack warden plays a blind man. surely, you'll wish you were blind after seeing this mess. sally field is particularly annoying as a stowaway on board caine's tug.disaster master irwin allen not only produced this one, he decided to direct it as well.

sequels, well there are many reasons to make 'em but what went through irwin allen's mind to come up with such a boring idea is beyond all logical matters. there are so many open answers to this movie that it is ridiculous...like the poseidon which is a monstruous ship with passengers on is drifting on the sea and just michael caine with his miniboat and an evil telly savalas discover the boat...well, at the beginning the french marine are circling above the wreck with their helicopter but as a sinking cruiseship is a daily thing, they just fly away... what am i trying to say??? hmmm, michael caine goes on board with sally field and he might pick up everything he sees (diamonds)if there wasn't a telly savalas who is looking for weapons on the ship...my god, why in fact am i wasting my words on here? it's ridiculous and knowing that both field and caine were involved makes you think what went through their minds when reading scripts....certainly not diamonds....

maybe here in sydney we are all poop side down and as a result we get to lap up floaters like this s-eek!-uel in classy theaters. released here in 1980 this hilarious all-tar drama was greeted with howls of delight at the session i attended. in fact the audience were so into the ludicrous antics on screen it played like a rocky horror session. within 5 minutes we all knew it was a real disaster: the tug boat scene where you can see the buckets of water tossed in from off-set. after that it was every patron for himself and the cinema rang with advice, cheering for bad acting and oo-waah reactions. the gunfight in the hold among the crates is especially idiotic and allows drunken viewers with friends in altered states also watching to contribute appropriately. i call these films with michael caine his holiday house films as i always reckon he agrees to do them because he has seen a house he likes and doesn't want to spend his savings. like jaws 3 or 4 or whatever it was called.

i accidentally caught this in the middle flipping channels. i immediately recognized almost everyone in the cast, "groovy" haircuts aside, and wondered what kind of film could attract such a cast of both past and future stars? having not seen the original, i guessed it might be the poseidon adventure, since it was obviously on a ship in distress. was i wrong! i cannot for the life of me imagine why any of these great (or promising) actors and actresses would allow their name to be associated with such trash. there is no story, the performances all looked forced, the characters a parody of the usual disaster movie roles that are suddenly brought together by an event, and start pontificating about the real meaning of life at the level of bumper sticker philosophy.it is only worthwhile to see the unusually awful performances by such greats as sally field, michael caine, et al. they must have needed the money badly. can we blame the director?

...but other than that, there's almost no redeeming social value to this sequel to the original poseidon adventure. where the heck are all the people from the original, including the rescue crew? michael caine undergoes his most humiliating performance to date (although he later trumps himself with jaws 4 down the road). slim pickens is just embarrassing as a stereotyped texas, and generally you just have to wonder, "why did they bother?" irwin allen's last stab at cashing in on the disaster craze, i guess.

being stuck in bed with the flu and feeling too rough to get up to find the remote, i actually watched this abomination from start to finish (how many people can say that? and for any who can - what's your excuse?). my god, has there ever, ever been such a total mess released by a major studio? there is not one second of genuine tension in a supposed "thriller"; the script is inept and ludicrous; the sets look like they were leftovers from a low-budget tv movie; and the cast ... what were they thinking?!!! sally field gives what is without doubt the worst and most embarrassing performance of any academy award winner in history. her irritating nasal whine and stupidly perky behaviour in what is meant to be a life-threatening situation are truly asinine. it's a wonder she didn't use all her future earnings to buy up and destroy every print of this turkey. michael caine, who now pontificates endlessly on the art of screen acting - even running master classes for would-be thespians - should be taken out and shot (preferably by one of telly savalas' henchmen). angela cartwright, an actress i usually like (and whose name isn't even in the opening credits, poor soul), is ten years too old for her role, and her horrible matronly yellow prom dress must haunt her nightmares to this day. slumming it are karl malden and shirley knight - hopefully they collected a big pay packet to assuage their involvement. the whole film is a series of bad scenes, but one that especially sticks in my mind is the explosion which results in the "ceiling" (if an upside-down ship's deck can be termed as such) collapsing and a load of empty cardboard boxes falling through! ooh, how scary! really, really, terrible.

stodgy drama starring pat o'brien as a washed-up reporter who turns up at his ex-boss's house to ask for money to fund his son's operation, only to find him dead on the floor. since o'brien knows the identity of the culprit, he offers to take the rap in return for the money he needs. a decent premise is wasted on a film that pretends it has surprises, twists and turns, even though it really doesn't. performances are rotten across the board, the movie dresses itself up as a hard-boiled american noir but the mix of dodgy accents doesn't work, and the story is hardly gripping. and it contains possibly the least attractive screen kiss of all time.

a washed up reporter called bart crosbie (pat o' brien) blackmails gang boss heinz webber (george colouris) for the money to pay for his son to have a life saving operation. in return he agrees to turn himself in for the murder of his editor, whom the gang killed in order to prevent an incriminating story being printed about them.typical poverty-row b-pic of the time directed for far more than it's worth by terence fisher, who within months of making this would become one of the leading british horror film directors at the hammer studio. the script is far-fetched and teen idol tommy steele (guitar in hand) was drafted in to sing a poor rock and roll number called "the rebel" at a coffee bar that acts as a legitimate front for the gang's activities.

another eli roth in the making. self promoting, bad script writing excuse for a horror director. victor is as far from the new horror icon as mary poppins (reference to the disney score). what is going on here? you have marilyn manson opening and closing this piece of crap and chitty chitty bang bang all through it. can this even be called horror? horrible, yes, but horror is a stretch. david lynch should sue them for stealing the elephant man prosthetics. please stop these fan boy want to be directors now. the video directors already have enough competition breaking into the film industry. getting online and talking about how great your movie is does not make it true. stop the insanity. i work in the industry and yes these films are fun to work on, but rarely ever entertaining to actually watch.

this movie is one of the worse examples of hype. people who read imdb comments might be tempted to view this total waste of time, as i was, by false tag-lines like " a throwback to 80's horror" and what-not. this movie sucks, from the acting to the directing to the story. horrible, all across the board. and i really like good horror films, i am not at all a snob. this sucked. for reference, i loved the grudge 1 and 2, black sheep, planet terror, texas chaisaw massacre the beginning, the others, the ring, jason x, slither, planet terror, and really hated the ring 2, texas chainsaw massacre(re-make)wolf creek, the hills have eyes(re-make)hostel 1 and 2, and this movie. gore doesn't trump fun or originality.

i don't understand what the big hype was about this film. all the horror sites were saying that this movie had all the essentials of an 'old american slasher' flick that it would satisfy your needs. -- even though this was similar to an old american slasher flick, my needs were still not satisfied.my big problem with this movie is that we are now in the 2000's, not the 1980's. 1980's horror is the past and should stay in the past. horror movies have changed so much that older movies now look cheesy and unrealistic. even though they are fun to watch, they don't offer the same realistic blood thirsty gore that the recent films offer.hatchet is cheesy, unrealistic, and down-right awful. if we wanted to watch an old american slasher flick, i can just go back to the friday the 13th series, nightmare on elm street series, or the halloween series. i must admit, the movie is better than some of the horror movies being released but it is among the worst. the jokes are not funny and the actors are horrible.i would personally stay away from this movie and never look back.

i first heard of this movie at the "flashback weekend" in chicago 2007 for the "nightmare on elm street". robert englund was really talking the movie up and he was great in his part of "hatchet". the same can be said for tony todd. knowing this is a low budget first time director / writer it delivers every bit as much as the big budget and also cameo laden "holloween" (2007) remake/re-imagining.technically it falls short in a couple of places. the alligator attack seen was shoot too dark. when it happened the dark head of the alligator against the swamp clamping on to the black pants became almost invisible. the mood music in the swamp scenes was too loud in volume and canned, like a bad sitcom. and just like "holloween" (2007) someone is smart enough to have a gun, but of course shooting the killer is only a pause button for the killer. the ending, well, as soon as i saw where it was going i knew what was going to happen, not very original.the highlights of the movie are the characters and their interactions. unlike "holloween" (2007) we got to meet the people and care what happened to them. ben (joel moore, who is also the lead of "spiral")the sulking lead and marcus ("not another teen movie")as the best friend and funny man to root for during the movie. shapiro (joel murry "dharma & greg"), jenna (joleigh fioreavanti) and misty (mercedes mcnab of "buffy the vampire slayer: the series", "angel: the series" and "the addams family" movies) give a convoluted reason for topless women. mr. and mrs. permatteo played by television regulars (richard riehle "grounded for life", patrika darbo "step by step")as the older couple that you know don't stand a chance, even the tour guide shawn (parry shen) is a fleshed out character. i hope to see more from all involved in this film, but i think it will play better on home video than in the theater, sorry.

harry knowles has a quote right on the front cover of the dvd stating"the next icon of horror" really?!?!?!? i have heard a lot of hype surrounding this one but wasn't totally convinced. however i am a die hard horror fan and will give just about any horror movie a chance. no matter the budget or the rating cause ya never know where your gonna find the next gem. not here.not hatchet. hatchet is poorly conceived,poorly acted and un funny. just because you have the actors who played freddy jason and candyman and a buffy chic topless with tons of gore does not make you an expert on horror.sorry. i don't even want to describe the plot because it is so idiotic. honestly my money is on rob zombie. there is a man who knows old school horror. forget this trash.

in the only act of commonsense they have ever made, the nsw film & television office refused to fund this film. the producers kicked up a big stink & in a blaze of publicity took their production to victoria. apart from the lost work for technicians, nsw were lucky not to have been involved...the film fails on just about every level. the post modernism fails, the casting fails (what is rose byrne's character all about ? which 1 dimensional snarling nasty did hugo weaving channel ? what the hell is pia miranda's character doing?) and the story is a clichéd mess of contradictions. in fact, the story runs like a dragged out prelude rather than a complete plot line.it might have had a chance if the "pop culture meets depression" style was better thought out and executed. if the casting was quirkier, if the style was less serious ... if just about everything was different. apart from the usual excellence in costume, design & cinematography (like most australian films), the film is just a total miscue. at a reported budget in excess of $7m, "the tender hook" is a symptom of the malaise of the australian film industry - the wrong people and the wrong projects are getting funded. compare this mess with "noise" (under $2m), or "cedar boys" (under $1m) and you get the idea. the tough, interesting films are struggling for funding and the flabby, overblown projects with name casts are getting the bucks.the funding bodies who invested in this deserve to go the same way as hugo weaving's character at the end of the film.

the tender hook, or, who killed the australian film industry? case no. 278. this sorry excuse for a period drama takes a cast and idea with potential  rose byrne, pia miranda, hugo weaving, in a jazz-era gangster drama  and turns it into a sloppily paced and executed soporific. mcheath (weaving) is a boxing promoter and gangster and functioning illiterate; for no apparent reason he's given to singing bob dylan and leonard cohen songs before bouts. how post-modern. how stupid. anyway. there's a boxer, art (matthew le nevez), who becomes mcheath's latest protégé, over his unfortunately aboriginal stablemate alby (luke carroll).mcheath's flapper moll iris (byrne) makes the goo-goo eyes at him. sexual tension squelches under the surface. miranda plays daisy, a friend of iris's (these flower girls stick together) who keeps turning up in scenes unannounced. they practice dancing together and talk about "hooking up" with guys. in the 1920s. i stopped counting anachronisms after that. there's a subplot involving japanese beer and a backstory of broome pearl fishermen. i don't know what it was all about. for some reason that is not exactly (at all) explained, byrne puts cocaine in art's lemonade. mcheath thinks he's a drunk and sacks him. byrne plots and schemes to help him out again. she's a big one for the plotting and scheming. most of which causes trouble. mcheath's two gunsels, portly ronnie (john batchelor) and russian donnie (tyler coppin), debate bumping off mcheath when he realises their part in one of iris's schemes, but ronnie wimps out when he sees mcheath crying. a lot of practically incoherent scenes get in the road of the film finally ending.director jonathan ogilvie spends a lot of time working with cinematographer geoffrey simpson creating some pretty images, but utterly fails to generate a sense of style, which might have compensated for and decorated the wispy, pathetically underpowered script; unfortunately ogilvie's sense of film grammar, the lack of structuring of the scenes and exposition, is stunningly incompetent. in an early scene, daisy suddenly appears in the car with the protagonists. how she got there, and indeed who she is, seems to have slipped ogilvie's mind. there are many more examples of this sloppiness. where he chases poetic sparseness, he achieves only wan irritation. he gains awkward performances from actors who are normally reliable, badly miscasting weaving and leaning on byrne's ability to project a kind of haunted doll-like humanity whilst saddling her with an incomprehensible character.it might not matter so much if the story had more substantial characters and stronger plotting preferably not stolen from a dozen old noir films and festooned with witlessly sprinkled pop-culture quotes. but it doesn't. it's boring.

whenever i see a video like this, i have to ask myself how it was financed. hbo or showtime or whatever must pay for the production company to go through the motions -- to hire someone who may or may not actually speak english to get high and hammer out something approaching a plot, to pay strippers with terrifying boob jobs to bounce up and down on grossly waxed dudes' torsos, to find people to design and light sets, to purchase the rights to cheesy techno music, etc. but i have to imagine this has to be a vanity project for whoever's serving as executive producer... he had to have nailed all of those girls, right? and bro's not wrong about the "spanish looking" girl, but to call the cops "stunning" is awfully generous. in fact, i'd go so far as to call them something much closer to "hideous," or "fugly." watching these women writhe around -- sometimes *clearly* high on pain killers -- was so far from erotic that my testicles actually ascended inside of my body. gross.why waste time with this when there's so much freely available hardcore porn on the internet? i wonder whether the popularization of internet video will slowly kill the softcore video industry... one can only hope, right?

there's nothing wrong with softcore but this one is pretty clinical - lots of nudity but it's all fake (of course, it's always fake - it's a movie but you know what i mean). there's no sexuality or erotica, it's all random nudity and poor acting of "lust" and sex with each other.part of it is of course, your personal preference. these women clearly have some body issues with their piercings, tattoos and silicon - not to mention that overly plastique & leathery look so if that's your thing - great, you get to see all that here.i don't think anyone's expectations are very high when looking at a movie title such as this but for many people, it would be pretty much like looking at cyborg fembots ... they almost seem real but it's really more creepy.

it is amazing what you can see if you wake at 2 am and turn on the telly. i didn't know they showed films like this. i immediately thought of roger corman, who reused locations for movies or used other films locations for his own movies.the makes of this film could just move the camera angles and add some time and they would have an xxx film.there was no story, just minimum dialog that led to stripping and sex. i bet there wasn't 100 words in the whole film, but there sure was a lot of very large busts and hot lesbian action. there was male/female action too, but it was only about 25% of the movie.another interesting thing came to mind in watching this film that may interest those who are buying hi def dvds. sony refused to license betamax to adult film makers and adult films came out on vhs. you can guess what happened to beta max as the adult film industry makes millions of videos. sony has again refused to license blu-ray to the adult film industry and they have just signed a deal with toshiba. you can guess which high def system will disappear.

"air bud 2: golden receiver" is a very bad rehearse in making a sequel in the course of a single year. the first film was cute, cuddly and charming. the idea of a dog playing on a basketball team is quite far fetched, but he defiantly pulled off enough stunts to save the concept. even the human story had some explanation to it. josh's father was killed in a plane crash, so he is sad. and the audience becomes emotionally involved as well.now for the poorly made sequel. it is terrible. this is the worst kind of bad sequel, the kind that changes the good ideas and turns them into bad ones. the kind that changes the main plot piece in one way, this time, the k-9 plays football instead of basketball. no madder how much time is spent in mind over matter, benefit of a doubt, walk into with an open mind of an attitude you have with a film like this, there is no positive thinking when it comes to down right bad film making.the sequel stars kevin zegers as josh, who is in eight grade. he lives with his mother and little sister in a seattle suburb. in the first film the human story involved him losing his father in a plane accident, which the audience can relate to, most people know what it feels like to lose a close loved one. in this movie, the emotional plot is a bit more complicated. josh's mother is dating once again. he and buddy, his dog who can play basketball, don't like this at all. why? if i were in his shoes i would love to have an extra parent in my life, especially one this nice. the man's name is patrick sullivan, and josh's mother, jackie, met him became he is a local veterinarian for buddy.the animal story is too simple. josh is influenced by his best friend to try out for the school football team, the timber wolves. the team itself looks like something from america's funniest home videos, the can even catch a ball without tripping or plummeting into each other. so when bud shows up one day, he proves he can play as a receiver for them, and is no doubt the team's best player.buddy's extremely cute in his football costume. oh, he is enough to melt the heart. the dog is the best in this movie as well. too bad there wasn't enough stunts done by him to draw attention away from the fact that no one ever asks any questions about a dog playing off a school football team.there is a very bad sub-plot about russian circus workers that like stealing amazing animals, of course they try to catch buddy. but their dim minds are ruled over by the animals and end up doing what looks like a "home alone" scenario to them."air bud 2: golden receiver" is much more goofy than the first too. the russian kidnappers add a bunch of lamebrain slapstick that, i have to admit made me laugh, at the stupidity of it all. there are way too many sequences that detail a screwball nature and too few scenes that depict the true reason why people will see this movie-to see a dog play football.the performances were also quite the embarrassment. i liked gregory harrison and robert costanzo's presentations, but the overall acting grade would be equivalent to a d+. kevin zegers and cynthia stevenson were absolutely pathetic.there were a few hilarious moments near the end by a couple of football announcers, but that isn't even worth mentioning. will children enjoy this movie? perhaps, but even they will grow weary when the heart felt discussions become too long and deep. they will most certainly complain that the dog didn't get enough screen time in, and loath over the fast changing script, and protest against the boring performances, and argue that this movie is trash in comparison the origami al "air bud," as i did.i suppose that they will think the dog is adorable.

this is without a doubt the worst sequel i have ever seen, & i've seen plenty of them to make that conclusion. the plot is simply ridiculous. i can catch a ball & run around a field, too. why can't i play in the superbowl? yes i know this movie was intended for children, but there are just some plots that even children can realize are totally dumb & unrealistic. the first air bud movie was pretty good, but this one was a total crash. disney is loosing it. if i controlled who won the razzie awards, i would give this one a couple. have a nice day! =)

[warning: some spoilers included, though it is a documentary.]i bought this documentary because i like the work of the directors d.a. pennebaker and chris hegedus, which includes moon over broadway, startup.com and the war room., all terrific documentaries i would highly recommend. watching this ultimately boring and uninsightful account from depeche mode's 1988 tour, i realized they had nothing to work with when they went to edit this film together. the band members were certainly less than forthcoming on-camera; hence, undoubtedly, the contest to add fans on a one-week bus trip was added to liven things up a bit. really, now, i mean, c'mon. who thought a concert film of a synth-pop band with three keyboardists and a singer would be a good idea? granted, i like depeche mode's music, and martin gore writes good melodies, but seeing them in concert never seemed like it would be interesting, and this movie is proof positive. unless you are a huge fan of depeche mode, stay away from this documentary....it's a complete waste of time.

as a massive fan of dm, it goes without saying that i have seen this film numerous times. however, i watch it purely for the concert footage...the rest of the film is, um, pretty dreadful, sad to say.famed rock music film director da pennebaker followed mode around on their late 80s music for the masses tour, which promoted the superb album of the same name. the title 101 derives mostly from the fact that the concert material included is from the 101st and final concert of the tour at the pasadena bowl, but is also a reference to the movie being a 'beginners course' on the band and how it ticks ie depeche mode 101. amidst footage of the quartet playing live and exploring america is a second story thread covering a group of dm fans who've won a competition to meet the band, go on the tour in their own coach bus and attend the finale gig.now, as i said above, the concert footage is great. mode are here on top of their form as stadium rock gods, which was a somewhat unusual achievement for an electrorock band back in the late 80s. though the film catches the band before they recorded their 1990 masterpiece "violator", there are still countless excellent tracks seen and heard here eg behind the wheel, the majestic never let me down again, everything counts, just can't get enough from the vince clarke years, shake the disease and many more.when mode are onstage, they are brilliant. when they are not, they're, well, very boring. nothing even vaguely of interest happens to the lads as they check out the us in the dying days of the reagan administration. as an example, the probable "highlight" of the material is a visit to a country music store to buy cassettes. not exactly thrilling stuff. i know all bands don't have to be wild and reckless idiots, but these guys make the mormon tabernacle choir look like rammstein.the only real excitement comes from various clips centring on the band's lead singer dave gahan. gahan comes across in 101 as being mildly psychotic, talking about a violent power inside himself he can't control, recalling a bizarre rage attack involving a taxi driver and so on. there's one point in the film where he throws a prima donna tantrum at some poor guy backstage - truly embarrassing. the man clearly had issues back then, which thankfully have been resolved. songwriter martin gore and keyboardist andy fletcher are presented as very articulate, clearly massively talented, but also utterly colourless men; while the somewhat enigmatic fourth member alan wilder is the only one of the quartet who pulls off the rock star persona with any sort of aplomb.and as for the 'fan tour' thread, well it's unwatchable dross. let's not kid ourselves. maybe it's just because it's all so *very* late 80s, but the gaggle of young devotees do little for me but raise a feeling of irritation. they are, to a person, singularly shallow and vapid people, whose antics are banal when they aren't hide-your-face cringeworthy. let me reiterate....*nothing* happens in the footage that isn't onstage that is of any interest. nothing. endless scenes of kids spraying their hair, arguing pointlessly, changing their clothes, getting lost in cities on the way to gigs and finding their partners in bed with another competition winner makes me wonder just one thing - if cure fans were this mind bendingly dull back in '88/89. the love the youngsters have for the band is something i can definitely relate to, and is at times infectiously joyous, but if what we see was the most interesting stuff out of what was filmed of them, then i'd hate to see the outtakes.but the music is all that matters, and in this regard 101 excels. the pasadena concert, one of their all time best gigs, makes the film worth seeing. the recent dvd edition of the movie comes with a bonus disc containing what remains of the unedited concert footage (a good 80% of the performance), and thus makes the dvd an absolute must for fans. the audio commentary by the band (minus wilder, who left mode in the mid-90s) on the first disc is also, oddly, far more interesting than the film itself.as a document of the boys from basildon during their amphitheatre idol period, depeche mode 101 is invaluable. but if you're looking for excitement, you're better off getting the accompanying double live album (now available in super audio cd format).

the plane is a 747 jumbo. the cockpit is located on the upper deck on a 747. in the movie the pilots do not climb the stairs in the 1st class cabin to reach the cockpit. they walk to the front of the 1st class cabin and through doors into the cockpit. what a gaff !!! the front of the first class cabin has a cloakroom for jackets and a tv screen. beyond that is the radar dome. before takeoff a 747 is shown to commence the taxi to the runway. on take-off the plane is shown to have only two engines. areal 747 has four engines. who was in charge of continuity on this movie ? during the early part of the flight the front of the plane suddenly includes toilets - another farcical gaff !!! after that the front of the plane becomes the rear and vice-versa. at this point i stopped watching. absolute rubbish!!!

i would have given this film a one star vote had it not been for the laughs i got out of it. some of the dialogs were just plain so lame that they make you laugh!! how could some one have actually talked like this. not to mention the fact that the bodyguard majors (antonio sabato jr.) flew a 747 like a pro and michael pare's team of whiners were able to dig a trench filled with gasoline and blow up a huge boulder in the nick of time. did anyone notice the lame tribute to "fantasy island" with the guy saying "boss, the plane!!" to michael pare just as the 747 comes in sight.the only saving grace were the cute girls and even cuter female hijackers. not to mention that the main hijacker deserved to die the lame death that he did for being such a joker!! imagine escaping from being tied up just to shot by a "crossbow". hello.the poor pilot probably died in the plane while everyone was eating steak and having rum!! just for laughs, they should make a sequel to show us how they all spend the night in the midst of a category 3 hurricane on neptune atoll. did i hear michael pare calling it the "best honeymoon resort in the pacific." now that would make an interesting movie!!

maybe this movie was actually intended to be satire like 'airplane' but it failed at that as miserably as it failed at being a 'thriller'. i don't understand why they couldn't have paid an actual pilot a couple hundred bucks for a little technical advice. hell, i would have done it for free! this magical aircraft managed to morph from a 757 to a 767 to a 747 in an hour and the power levers worked backward. and the dialog sounds like it came out the back end of a kid's game of 'telephone' where everyone spoke different languages. i actually rewound the tivo and watched some of it a second time to see if it was really as bad as i thought at first. it was.

i have seen three other movies that are worse than this one, "plan 9 from outerspace", "side hackers" and the dreaded "blair witch project" there are so many technical errors in this movie that regardless of a decent plot the movie just isn't believable.let's start with an amtrak train with no skirts or handrails between cars. the killer walks up behind his victim as she moves from car to car and just pushes her off the train.in one scene a killer sneaks into a woman's apartment. he wants to sneak up on the woman to kill her, so what does he do? he turns up her stereo! if i heard my stereo suddenly get louder i'd be concerned. he kills the women by throwing an electric hair curler into the tub. i was amazed to see that an electric hair curler with a five foot cord could be tossed ten feet and remain plugged in. plus the apartment looked modern enough to have ground fault outlets in the bathroom and the victim was still electrocuted.the boeing 747 is one of the most well known commercial airliners on the planet so this part really amazed me. first the cockpit was not even close to a real 747 and second it wasn't on the top deck of the plane. i watched in utter amazement as the pilot and co-pilot (where was the flight engineer?) walked right past the spiral staircase and headed forward toward's the nose of the airplane.i was also amazed that bullets wouldn't penetrate an aluminum serving cart (good thing for our hero), or bathroom doors, but would penetrate the ceiling causing a fuel leak that exited through a small hole in the fuselage. huh? watching three guys lengthen a runway by 100 yards in less than a week was pretty amazing as well.i didn't check, was this a movie of the week or something? it was terrible.

you have to see this. i could not stop laughing about the stupidities i saw in this movie even late after the event. there is maybe a million of individual mistakes and stupidities in this movie. the acting is bad. the story is so predictable and flat. the effects are like 50 years old. the supposed thriller is nowhere. you will not enjoy the movie, but you will laugh at it and enjoy laughing at it a long time after it. we had a great time after the movie. truly. me and my friend spent entire 40mins long bus trip home chatting about this movie like we have seen next oscar winner. sadly we were talking about all those bad things we had just seen.

my suggestion..... this movie was really intended to be a "comedy",wasn't it?!!!! if not, the producers, directors, actors & "hair stylists" should really choose another career! now, the guidelines of my submission requires a minimum of "10 lines". how in the world can i add any more to this? hmm...let me see. oh yes, the beginning of the movie was quite hilarious with the "crash landing" scene. too bad that the plane didn't hit the tanker truck & a bunch of "martians" would have scrambled out from the wreckage (obviously hiding) and decided to take over the "world" planet and make a better movie. now, that would have been a great beginning!t

i can't believe that someone actually paid to have this film made. stupid, unrealistic, and stereotypical. right from the take off of the massive 747 the pilot pulled the throttles back to increase speed. then you have 5 armed persons with semi to fully automatic weapons firing without so much as one bullet breaching the walls of the pressurized cabin at 38,000 feet. then once below in the belly of the plane a stray bullet hits a fuel line and we see the fuel leaking from the side of the plane. the acting was just horrid and forced. there just didn't seem to be any direction. i have seen some pretty horrid b movies in my lifetime but with the names that were in this film i was extremely disappointed.

the idea that anyone could of concocted such a trite, cliché, yet indeliberately comical movie is shocking. the final 20 minutes of this film are comical glory; with six men digging enough trench in 10 minutes to light the runway with gasoline for a 747, while a supposed 'major' perfectly lands the 747 in a 110mph crosswind - leading one to question the misnomer of calling this movie crash landing...some of the dialogue was equivalent to rubbing sandpaper in my ears, while the only aspect that saved this movie for a 1 was the plethora of attractive women filling the screen a large portion of the time. not exactly a consolidation for this pathetic excuse of a movie, but my mute button finally received a workout.view at your own risk! 2 out of 10

hilarious!! i would have sworn ed wood wrote this. terrible. i loved every frame. bad movie aficionado's, this is your trophy! i will watch it again. words cannot explain how entertaining this movie is. pare's career must have dipped low, but i really think he's heading in the leslie nielson direction. he was perfect for this. terrible, just terrible!! you'll love it!! get some friends, lots of beer, and you'll have the time of your life. it's an mst3000 party, waiting to happen. enjoy!! it is worth the rental!! you like the "colombo type" cop and the comic relief coroner. the bad guy will have you on the floor laughing. he's also in another pare movie, komodo vs cobra, and he's just as good there. i don't know what the budget was but they'll get it back because this film is destined to be the best unintended comedy of the year.

aghhhhhh! what a disappointment. a perfectly good hunk like antonio sabato jr and nothing but embarrassing drivel coming out of his mouth. i cringed at 95% of the dialog! it would have been better to have made the character a mute! how antonio sabato and michael pare could speak those lines without losing control of some bodily function is beyond me! if michale pare's character prefaced or ended just one more sentence with the word 'men' i think i would have thrown the iron through the tv set (i love to multitask - especially to get through bad movies). must have been a lean year for both of them to sign up for this movie. washing cars for a living would probably look pretty good to them by now. and the bad guy......if he was so bad why didn't he just shoot all those rich college kids instead of promising toilet breaks. even the title was a misnomer. a 'crash landing' means the plane actually crashes and doesn't just land without even a token fire or anyone being injured. instead of landing safely the plane should have crashed and burned just like the script.this movie is a stinker !

this movie is so bad it's worth seeing. this movie will have viewers lapsing in and out of a coma within the first 10 minutes. it all started when a bunch of writers came up with the idea of a jetliner being hijacked and a passenger who can fly a small plane has to land the beast. however, they know it's been done before many times so to make it different, let's do it very badly! major masters has his name pirated from 80's movie "to live and die in l.a." from character played by willem dafoe. that saved 10 minutes in writing and production time. the plane is supposed to be a boieng 747. that plane has a unique silhouette, even in the dark with its characteristic forward hump on the top. just ask the late ronald reagan who lamented this point when them ruskies shot down kal 007 in the eighties. yet when the plane takes off it's clearly not a 747 looks more like a 767. this well researched film also forgets to include the engineer's seat in the cockpit and replaces it with two comfy rumble seats. no need for a flight engineer on this complex plane! heroine is played by perpetually pouting gloria lynn berg. after tying up the hijacker, despite several bus-loads of people on this jumbo jet, nobody bothers to watch this guy who almost killed all of them. he's just forced to amuse himself.the crippled plane, leaking fuel from all the hijacking shenanigans won't make it back to hawaii so masters will try to land at an air force base located on an island. only the runway's 300 feet too short! four army guys with little bobcats (the kind you rent to take all day moving a load of horse manure to the back of your barn), are gonna clear a 200 foot wide and 300 foot long swath through the jungle in 20 minutes! no need for a bulldozer here! where can you find guys like this? these guys could make a highway between los angeles and las vegas in 3 hours equipped only with tablespoons, a compass and a duck!after that hellish obstacle is fixed, masters will try to land the plane as heroine pouts away. hijacker giggles to himself and unsupervised gets free to make more trouble. he is finally subdued in a most retarded manner that i can't tell you. but, can you say moby dick?there are so many retarded scenes in this movie. the wounded captain is parked prone on the bar on the plane while masters, who supposedly can barely fly, puts the plane into 60 degree banks and 20,000 feet per minute drops. the pilot should be french kissing the ceiling during these challenging stunts, but doesn't budge an inch. i think that if they had picked different actors to play the parts, this moving could have been way better. if we need a pouting heroine in the movie, why not pick better known actress bernadette peters who seems to be perpetually pouting as well? besides, she can sing and the busty well aging peters could feature some gratuitous cleavage shots. now with the singing angle this could be a hijacking, let's land the plane movie musical! cast luciano pavarotti as the pilot. they can sing a duet in the cockpit prior to the hijacking and there's no way that tubby tenor would fly up to the ceiling as masters works his magic on that big bird. in keeping with the musical theme, masters could then be played by andrei bocelli, that peters can sing with as he lands the plane. not only is he totally blind but only knows a couple of words of english. now that's a plot! think of the edge of your seat conversation between masters (bocelli) and the air traffic controller:atc: "sir, please throttle back to 180, flaps set to 25 degrees. maintain 230 heading"bocelli: "what?"atc: "sir, arm spoilers now, confirm brake pressure at 250 psi. maintain descent at 500 fpm"bocelli: "what?"the hijacker could have been played by the late great rodney dangerfield who can spew a plethora of his one liners as he sits tied up and unguarded: "i get no respect. my wife is into group sex. yeah, she screwed me in front of the judge and jury!" get the idea?missed opportunities the movie has your standard crying and moaning passengers that are never developed. woody allen could have been at the back offering one of his neurotic monologues: "she said i was great in bed. i told her i practice myself a lot..." now this is a movie!also, according to similar movie "executive decision" where lazy eyed steven segal is mercifully killed at the start giving that movie a chance, 747's have massive attics up top. the plane was introduced in 1969 so who knows what has accumulated in almost 40 years up there? my uncle has old clothes, a sled, magazines and all sorts of stuff in his. wouldn't it have been cool if masters opened the trap door and saw a teary eyed chevy chase in a woman's housecoat watching old super 8 movies of his childhood? just a recommendation.so give it a chance, and as u lapse in and out of consciousness imagine how great this movie could have been if i had my hand in it...

i should have gone without seeing the movie after reading the review here. i saw the whole movie by fast forwarding and ended in 25 minutes. though its a low budget movie it could have been made better. the movie starts more like a thriller and in few minutes it tells you that you should switch off immediately. and why was the movie named "crash landing" when it was landed so well in such a bad climate. without any acting, all the characters where just moving or doing like kids.and should not forget to comment on the joker - the main hijacker who would have been more suitable if this movie was a full time comedy.

this film was embarrassing in its clichés, poor acting and generally low production values. it starts out badly with the long haired 3 star general calling the hero, masters, "major" when he is obviously wearing the silver oak leaves of lieutenant colonel. but what was most distressing was the crew of soldiers on neptune atoll. how out of touch with any kind of reality can you get? they were all experts on flying a 747 and the scenes of the soldiers digging the ditch were beyond comical.warning: this film is dangerous to your intellectual health! watch at your own peril!

i gave this film a 2 mostly because it does actually have an ok cast but the film itself is just so (insert unusually rude word beginning with the sixth letter of the alphabet)-ing pointless that i felt bad that at the time i voted for it its lowest vote was a three.very predictable plot....two nare-do-well musicians have no money and plenty of money problems. however when a friend leaves a bag full of money (that belongs to drug dealers) in their care they of course spend it and then the "fun" begins.not an original idea in this whole film.

if you're not a fan of the 80s, and you need to be a particularly strong fan, or of one of the two leads, there's nothing about this film to recommend.the story, as others have said, is dull, almost an afterthought to the basic notion of the characters and the idea of making a slightly manic comedy. i watched it to about an hour, hoping it would turn a corner, a twist would occur or it would somehow kick into gear but no... it's not unwatchable, it's just dull. it goes by. it goes by with bits of running around madly, lingering shots of feet at strange angles, bits of shouting madly but i didn't get a real feel of energy or manic fun, it just came across as forced. needless to say also, there was nothing to laugh at particularly. a bit of mild amusement here or there but nothing more.don't be fooled by the mention of feminism by the way, all it means in this case is that almost all the principal cast is female. if anything, it's actually cloying... two female leads, fine, excellent, the drug dealer is female, okay, their landlord is a landlady, alright, their friends are female, okay, the only other person we particularly see who lives in the same building, oh, female... i wasn't on the lookout for that but after a while it felt like a conscious decision had been made to have the film cast that way and it felt, again, a bit forced and cloying.on the plus-side, if you are a fan of 80s fashions and culture, there is plenty to see and if you're a fan of helen slater, she's fun and enjoyable to watch. there's also some screen-time for carol kane, which is great, but not enough...overall: 3/10. if you're a huge fan of the 80s, helen slater and carol kane, you could maybe stretch it to a 5 because of them, although there's still the fact it's a comedy which isn't funny, which hinders it substantially. if you're not a fan of those things, you might as well make it 0 because there's nothing much else to enjoy here.

i want to say that i went to this movie with my expectations way too high. i thought it was going to be funny because it's the sequel to bruce almighty which was really funny and it stars steve carell who is an excellent comedic actor but boy, did it sucked.the movie is advertised as a sequel but it really has nothing to do with the original since the only people reprising their roles are morgan freeman and steve carell but steve's character is completely different, he is no longer the jerk he was in the first one here he is a nice guy. the story is different and the actors are different and it's not funny.all the actors involved(steve carell, morgan freeman, wanda sykes, john goodman, ed helms and even jon stewart in a very crappy cameo) have talent but none of them seems to use it and it looks that there in the movie just for the money.now the plot is obviously shaped after noah's story but there are so many wrong things with it, i don't know where to start. i guess the big problem is that in the everyone around evan thinks that he is crazy despite all the things that are happening to him, he grows a huge white beard in two days, he gets help from animals from all around the world, he builds a giant arc in a few weeks, in real life people wouldn't be mocking these guy after that, they would be saying he is the new noah.also the special effects are good but what the hell is the greatest movie flood ever filmed doing in evan almighty? did they really had to waste such good special effects as filler for this crappy movie.jim carrey seems to be a smart guy since he has stayed away of three of the worst sequels ever made, son of the mask, dumb and dumbered and now evan almighty.this was a giant disappointment and tom shyadac should be ashamed of himself.

this film is definitely up there with the worst films i've ever seen, probably in my top 5 of worst films. i laughed once and that was when:evan: "im building something" evan's secretary: "i hope its a barber shop"that was literally the only time i laughed in this 'comedy', awful compared to bruce almighty which as a big jim carrey fan...wasn't even that great! this movie lacked the humour of having god's powers and was more about family bonding. id class it solely as a family movie, definitely not a family comedy. seeing a bird poo on someone's shirt is not hilarious, neither is a beard that grows back instant!i didn't even think the special effects were great, the animals looked really stuck on, it was like watching a film which hadn't been 'glued' together properly2/10 film - avoid!

evan almighty (2007) ** steve carell, morgan freeman, lauren graham, johnny simmons, graham phillips, jimmy bennett, john goodman, wanda sykes, john michael higgins, jonah hill, molly shannon, ed helms, (cameo: jon stewart as himself) strained 'sequel' to "bruce almighty" with carell's jerk anchorman evan baxter leaving tv to begin his stint as a freshman congressional rep has his hands full when god (freeman reprising his holy role; jim carrey wisely avoided the 'calling') demands he build an ark like noah and the hilarity ensues (or should have). the godforsaken sitcom-y script by steve oedekerk, joel cohen & alec sokolow is absolutely lame and only carell's amiable persona transcends his vain evan into something resembling a human being. the end result is a lot of bird poop gags and overall bloat (reportedly costing $175 m for the cgi f/x). sykes steals the show as evan's sarcastic assistant. sacrilegiously unfunny. (dir: tom shadyac)

was this supposed to be funny? this is one of those films that just doesn't work. the first one, bruce almighty with jim carey, had some very funny moments. this one had none.steve carrell, who was brilliant in bruce almighty, fails to deliver here. his performance is very ordinary and he can't carry it off like carey did.the one good thing about this is i only paid $1.95 to rent it. it's a movie for children...very young children who have only seen about 4 films or so in their short lives.it's interesting to note that where jim carey stars in a film and they make a sequel without him that it's usually a huge turkey. anyone remember son of mask? (imdb worst 100 films of all time) avoid this one movie lovers.

evan almighty continues the mainstream bruce almighty franchise, this time with newsman turned freshman congressman from buffalo, evan baxter (steve carell), at it's center. a wholly innocuous (and not even really self-doubting) man, god (morgan freeman) decides to enforce some sort of quest upon baxter, in order to illustrate the importance of... reciprocal kindness, so that baxter can "change the world" (aka, pay it forward).think of evan almighty as a wholesome derivative of 'distinguished gentlemen.' baxter is not a con, but his colleague, congressman long (john goodman) wants his unquestioned support on a bill that essentially, is harmful to the environment. and well-meaning baxter, knowing the importance of networking and visibility, is willing to support him. in addition, with the new job comes more responsibility, and baxter is in a sense, vilified, for not spending enough time with his family. so god, decides to give evan baxter some guidance by forcing him to become the modern day noah. his orders: build an ark. except, while it may be mildly humorous to see baxter's transformation to the "weirdo with a beard-o," there doesn't seem to be much point to this whole thing which becomes abundantly clearer when the climax of the film fizzles. (spoilers: if none of the population is killed by the "flood", then what was the point of summoning the animals... or at least the ones that obviously weren't from suburban virginia? or, more importantly, if all baxter had to realize was that long's projects faltered in their quality, then why did he have to build an ark?).so, although a comedy like this needn't be a hysterical laugh-riot, it was certainly one made far less enjoyable as it was crammed with far too many homilies (and not all from morgan freeman) and action that seemed intended for a film of more epic events.

the creative team behind evan almighty really should have been able to make a better film. starring one of america's favourite funnymen and helmed by ace ventura pet detective director tom shadyac one expects a higher laugh count than the picture provides. hell even steve oedekerk who wrote and directed last years atrocious barnyard, and attains a writing credit here has done better work. the fact of the matter is that evan almighty isn't the worst picture of the summer season but it might well be the most disappointing. the title and creative team behind the picture suggest this is a sequel of sorts to 2003's bruce almighty. that picture had jim carrey in the lead, and whilst both steve carell and carrey are both funny guys it's the latter who's better suited to this sort of material. i've heard that carrey was offered this sequel before anyone else, but the actor declined staing he saw no other places for his character to venture. thus shadyac moved over to carell, who ever since an amusing bit part in the 2003 original has been gunning for stardom. after sleeper hits the 40 year old virgin and little miss sunshine the man has become big business, and so it's him rather than rubber faced jim who leads this production into theatres. the story see's evan baxter (steve carell) having been elected as a congressman and thus he and his troop move house and state so evan can find success with his job. his wife (lauren graham) and three kids have doubts but overall show a supportive side towards evan, who himself looks at the future with optimistic eyes. however things start to go belly up fairly fast, god (morgan freeman) appears to evan stating a flood is coming and that the politician must build an ark. initially ignoring the encounter, evan is quickly granted some robes a beard that refuses to stay shaved and animals are beginning to appear two by two. evan then begins to put the boat into construction but the neighbourhood aren't happy and neither is a fellow politician (john goodman). anyone expecting the wacky laughs of some of tom shadyac's other films will probably be left completely cold by this movie. ace ventura, liar liar and hell even bruce almighty where largely very funny pictures, but all of those ;projects have one thing in commen and thats jim carrey's presence. shadyac hasn't made a worthwhile film without carrey at the helm, he's worked with robin williams, eddie murphy and now steve carell, but still only carrey seems to meld successfully with shadyac. carell after the disappointing box-office and critical mauling won't be desperate to work with the director again, and with carrey now doing more serious projects shadyac had better find a new comic muse fast. carell himself is fairly dull here, whoever felt that his bit part in the first movie (despite being quite amusing) deserved a full length feature should be taken out back and shot. i expect after bruce almighty's box-office draw it was universal studios themselves, but you know when a quality comedian can't do anything with a character then the scren persona is a dud, and thats exactly the case with evan almighty. lauren graham isn't any great shakes as evan's wife nor do any of the children strike the right note. freeman lets it all hang loose as god in another amusing and chilled performance but he appears to sporadically to carry the piece. indeed the most consistent source of laughter is evan's secretary (wanda sykes) and creep co-worker (jonah hill), both made me laugh twice as much as any other character in the project. oedekerk's writing has been worse (barnyard) but also better (ace ventura when nature calls) than his work on this production. his script does have genuinely funny moments but it's also full of cloying family moments and the humour is never weird or indeed offensive enough. the film takes tame and easy swipes at religion when it ought to rip the concept to shreds, indeed the opening church sequence in the simpsons movie shakes religion harder than evan almighty's whole 95 minute run. with a bit more daring and heart this could have been a far better picture. i don't doubt that the core family audience will be mildly entertained by this film, but if they'll be satisfied is a completely different question. there's a line between being watchable and being worthwhile, a line that evan almighty is always on the wrong side off. maybe when you're feeling bored and the films on cable you can afford to watch, but i can think of plenty better ways to spend my time and indeed more importantly my money than tuning into this mediocre comedy.

maybe the subject was good, but put down to a script it fails in pace. maybe the author was trying to obtain something slow-paced like alien, but instead of being haunting, this movie turned out just boring. technically good, anyway, a pity for the lack of tension.

i just got done watching this movie and i have to say, it was a good film, i loved some of the good guy's and i loved the killer robot but the movie had some hole's in it.the name's of the people in it was kind of..stupid..i think people should of sued the maker's of this movie for how lame it was at the end..the first half hour was good but then it just dragged on and on then i was happy..it was over...but still loved the the killer robot and some of the movie's good guy's in it.i think it was the best two buck's i have ever spent because i do like stupid b-movie's like this one and come on..it is a b-movie everyone.

in a nutshell, skip this movie, it's that bad. in short, this movie is about a weapons factory where secret weapons are being developed. because they make bad things, they aren't popular so to speak. a new female ceo comes in to clear things up, and make sure the reputation of the company will be improved. she does this by leaking company confidential information to the press... do you believe this? furthermore she starts to fire people she has never seen. incredible uh? a pacifistic group tries to destroy the company's mainframe, because there are the blueprint located of those secret weapons. this mainframe is located in the bottom of the building hidden in a kind of vault. of course the movie would not be complete without the mad scientist and a robot which is the ultimate killer machine, which resembles like an 'alien' from the alien movies. the mad scientist likes the female ceo.the mad scientist instructs the robot to kill everyone, and so protects his job, rise in chain of command, and make the movie interesting. the pacifists team up with the ceo and another person of the board of directors to escape from the robot. further down the line they agree to blow up this evil computer mainframe, whilst avoiding the robot. they also discover that the factory was developing a part man, part machine soldier. they can erase a persons memory and replace it by a veteran soldier's one. one of the pacifists is transformed in such a soldier and will hunt the killer robot. i guess the mad scientist also wrote the script of this movie. this super soldier looks and acts much the same as robocop, though not as funny.it boils down to this. people are running, being chased by a killer robot, are hurt by it, but they do not seem to troubled by that, besides limping a bit, and of course the female ceo is the leading character of this movie, and cannot be killed, i.e. survives every attack, explosion, you name it. i won't bother you by the chase, let's skip to the end. they have lots of weapons, yes the pacifist too and they know how to use them. when they're at the roof of the building they empty all there weapons upon the killer robot. they step into an elevator which is used to clean outside windows. and then the female ceo knows some magic as well, at the roof she was complaining about being out of bullets, and like magic the gun is reloaded. this way she can shoot the cables and let the elevator plummet 70 stories or so, and let it stop right above ground surface by pulling the brake. and to top it all off, the police is waiting there for them. the robot jumps after them, and kills the cops. hilarious no? the robot chases them down the vault where the mainframe is, and when finally the robot is so close to her, that he can touch/kill her, it stops. because the mad scientist did not want her to be killed. a better name for this guy would be the idiot scientist. although he is the one who made this movie watchable. at this moment i was already pulling for the killer robot to finish them all of, so the movie would end.i cannot believe that this movie rates this high, and this is why i wrote this comment. avoid this movie like the plague. it's a monster, and i'm not talking about the death machine.

this is the worst film i've seen in a long long time, never mind the fact that so many useful things keep appearing on this island "how convenient!!!!", the acting is beyond poor from the outset, its like one of those really badly scripted soft porn films on channel 5, a complete waste of time, and i cant remember the lead actors name but i cant believe he still gets work!!! i've never seen him act "i've seen him in lots of films... but i've never seen him act. here are a few of the blaringly obvious errors, apparently petrol lighters still work even when they've been soaked in sea water!!! also according to this film you can walk into the sea naked but come out wearing bikini bottoms (i'm guessing the camera man and editor were students)there are plenty more errors but i'm ranting now, besides its no so much the errors as the cast the script and the whole film avoid at all costs

by far this has to be one of the worst movies i've ever seen in my life. i watch practically every movie that is on at night (either showtime, hbo, cinemax, etc). "three" aka "survivor island" keeps you in as much suspense as watching paint dry only to let you down even more miserably. if you want to feel like you just wasted what seems like an eternity on the worst film ever created then by all means watch this movie. i must have screamed at a minimum 900 times from the idiotic twists. if i had 4 hands i'd give this movie 4 thumbs down.in my personal opinion, i believe the only people who would like this movie are those with terrible morals.

i like to think that i can appreciate a movie that is a bit out of the ordinary, and i certainly love a good movie that makes me think.if you like out of the ordinary movies that make you think, then look elsewhere. this movie is so bad and so disjointed that the only thing you will be thinking after it is over is how it is possible you wasted 90 minutes of your life watching this.a movie of this kind needs a driver to get buy in from the viewer. why are we interested in the main characters? what motivates these characters through their existence? why do they make the decisions they make? this movie makes a very weak attempt at doing these and fails in the process. there is no chemistry between these two actors, both of who are superb in their ability to be comfortable in any role. so why did they fail here? i strongly feel that they didn't know what their motivations were either, and when an actor doesn't know, their audience can't follow.in sum, i have seen macromedia flash videos that offered more in the way of provoking thought, at least i have more interest in the morphed hamster who likes the moon than why this married family man would risk it all for a "code 46" violation.

there is nothing worse than science fiction crafted by folks who don't have a feel for it. grasping at a concept which wouldn't be so terrible by itself (a future where cloning is common enough that it is necessary to make it a crime for you to breed with someone too close to you genetically) the screenwriter proceeded to allow his ill-suited imagination to run wild.when tim robbins' character was able to guess a security guard's computer password simply by getting her to tell him one thing about herself, i knew i was in for trouble. this ability was later revealed to be due to robbins having taken an "empathy virus", viruses being used to grant instant (or nearly instant) skill upgrades to their users. robbins' love interest complained about her own experience with such a virus -- a mandarin chinese language virus, which allowed her to speak chinese, but as she complained, "she couldn't understand what she was saying." okay, first off, empathy, no matter how intense, isn't esp. without incorporating some sort of true mind-reading aspect (like an empathy virus which actively releases virions into the vicinity, infects nearby people, picks up bits of their memory, then departs for the original host -- which is, as you can probably tell, a smidgeon on the impractical side) you can't justify being able to determine a specific detail like someone's password just by "listening to the things you didn't say". nor can you acquire the ability to speak a language without understanding what you're saying -- the virus can't infect your vocal cords and translate for you on the fly, because a virus can't *think*. to give you the power to speak chinese, such a learning virus would have to modify your brain. it would have to encode the knowledge among neurons, and once it's in there, it's *yours* -- you certainly understand what you're saying, because you have to. to use your own brain to perform a task, you must understand that task (for the most part). unless, of course, they movie is suggesting that the virus was deliberately designed to put in place some bizarre multiple-personality mental schism where some sub-personae of yours functions as a built-in, one-way translator.the mélange of languages spoken by the characters is decent enough, although nowhere near remarkable enough to warrant all the love other reviewers have given. what's more, all the multicultural insertions in the world can't make up for a simple, frustrating fact: the dialog stinks! it's slow, it's plodding, and it's unnatural. again, i'm sure adherents have convinced themselves that the dull strangeness is simply the result of an inspired genius creating a truly futuristic (and therefore subjected to linguistic drift) form of speech. i disagree. good dialog is good dialog in any era -- and the same goes for tripe.lastly, i'll revisit the central concept of the movie -- the banning of sex with yourself. widespread cloning is a nice, classic sci-fi topic. so is global warming leading to ecological devastation (which code 46 also incorporates). unfortunately, the two don't go together! if you have an ecological disaster cutting down severely on the available living area, you don't run around cloning people! you have population problems enough as it is -- you don't add to them by cranking out re-issues. regular, old-fashioned sex-and-birth provides all the population you need, and cloning of any sort would be ruthlessly suppressed.to be fair, the movie wasn't all bad. it had some nice cinematography. perhaps if i had watched it muted, i could've enjoyed it.

i thought this film was a poor effort by the british film council - fell flat as hey, come on, tim robbins is an old guy and here is this beautiful young woman who falls straight for him as well. like lost in translation its really hard to suspend disbelief in this context. it's a good looking film but lacks punch. when tim robbins is pretending to be psychic it looks like he has a small migraine. he looks uncomfortable and life less. the part where he is screening suspect employees at sphinx is laughable. if an investigator came to my factory the last thing i would do is tell him about my freckle fetish. it's obviously over-intellectual. clumsy. the city is as it is, a convenient backdrop. they obviously picked the most futuristic city they could (shanghai) as a backdrop but the city never really comes out and effects the characters as in for example blade runner, where the characters of the city often intersect the story. slow as a wet week. no chemistry, real dramatic high points, so so plot.

***spoilers*** ***spoilers***i saw this movie last night at a screening. i started out already liking tim robbins and loving sci-fi. the first third of the movie was very cool. the score was good, the cinematography was interesting, the film maker's vision of the future was realistic yet starkly interesting nonetheless. i remember thinking to myself: "this is the most intelligently done sci-fi movie i've seen in a while". then they just couldn't keep it together.although from the outset, there were a number of more "rough around the edges" issues with this film (namely the editing, and later some of the writing/plot development), these issues were forgivable. they became unforgivable once the movie sort of lost all momentum around the half way mark, and then the film just got tedious when you realized that it wasn't going to go anywhere at all. robbins could not breathe life into his character, but did the best he could. his female counterpart (her name escapes me now) was good in her role.the main reason for the meandering of the movie seemed to be that the film makers could not decide whether or not to do a sci-fi movie or a futuristic love story. they ended up with neither.good:some of the cinematography: grainy, it felt like "21 days later" some times.very fitting for a futuristic movie like this.i dug some of the location shots.the music was cool.the film makers vision of the future was realistic but still cool and interesting.i liked the interactions with the other minor characters in the movie.some of the writing was interesting (early on). the girl who played maria gonzales (name?? can't recall), she was good.***spoilers below***a few questions/comments:i felt that a lot of the futuristic things in this movie were convenient to fix a patchwork story. namely viruses. obviously the virus they gave her at the end of the film that made her physically 'afraid' of him was just there so that they could stick in another sex scene and then she could uncontrollably report him for code 46. then they take him away and erase his memory and the movie ends. classic 'dream sequence' cop-out ending if you ask me. ties up all the loose ends very neatly if you just make it all a dream right?was robbin's character naturally good as intuition or was it the virus?why didn't they explore the myriad of issues surrounding the girl being a clone of his mom? that could have made some interesting story.at first i like the salutations from across the globe in everyone's speech. but it became intrusive especially since their accents were not convincing. i get it, the future will undoubtedly be racially and culturally more androgynous, but it started feeling like an at&t global networking commercial by the end of it.if they were 'outside' how could they have gotten busted for code 46?'cover' was never well defined. sometimes it seemed as trivial as a visa, and other times it was as vital as life or death. again, loose definitions allow them to use it for gluing disparate parts of the plot together.okay, i'm starting to get to negative about it, so i'll stop. there were some cool scenes, and interesting things about this movie, but that only gives it a 4/10

we're in a not so distant future, globalization seems to have reached a high point, languages mixes with each other (although english prevails over the rest), races have merged, human clonation is a fact, and all the territory seems to have been divided in two zones: the one for the valid and the one for the non-valid... a brave new world (in aldous huxley's style) in which people are genetically filed and blood relationships are strictly forbidden (for health reasons that's the code 46 of the title-). in such environment two souls that are destined not to meet fall in love with each other.winterbottom had an important story, with quite a big potential. a nice recipe that he ruins giving it a so slow rhythm, narrating it in a so weary way, removing any emotions... coldness, that's all code 46 transmits. coldness and boredom. not even the presence of samantha morton and tim robbins (both of'em play their roles wonderfully) , nor the visual and sound power of some sequences can do anything to save the movie. what a pity.code 46: what could have been and never was.*my rate: 4/10

if you are a weirdo who thinks it's "romantic" and wonderful to have sex with a woman who is the genetic equivalent of your mother, get her pregnant, and then have sex with her again once she's had an abortion and not tell her that she is related to you, then you would like this movie.nevermind the fact that the guy is married and has a son at home - it makes it even more disgusting and deplorable that he has no conscience as to what he's doing. he can't do right by his job, his family, or maria. he's a loser. there is nothing romantic or positive about this movie - it is vile and incestuous.it moves slowly and it leads nowhere for over the first half of the movie. i couldn't even finish watching this pathetic excuse for a 'romance'. i'm glad we didn't waste our money in the movie theater on this one. 0/10

i just finished watching this film and think it is one of the worst films i have ever seen. it was so boring that i found myself zooming through it at x2 speed and finished it in less than 30 minutes. i was not just disappointed, but angry that i had wasted my money to rent it. it ranks within the top five of the worst films i have ever seen, and i've seen thousands of movies! the plot was very confusing. had i not first read the dvd sleeve cover, prior to renting it, i would have been totally lost throughout this film. i would not have thought that tim robbins, after having made such good films as "shawshank redemption" would have agreed to appear in this film.

the film disappointed me for many reasons: first of all the depiction of a future which seemed at first realistic to me was well-built but did only feature a marginal role. then, the story itself was a weak copy of lost in translation. the middle-eastern setting, man with family meets new girl overseas, karaoke bar, the camera movements and the imagery - all that was a very bad imitation of the excellent lost in translation which had also credibility. this movie tries to be something brilliant and cultural: it is not. i wonder why tim robbins even considered doing this film!? the female main actress is awful - did she play the precog in minority report? and why do you have to show the vagina in a movie like this? lost in translation didn't have to show excessive love scenes. r-rated just for this? this movie isn't even worth watching it from a videostore!

european films may be slower-paced and less plot driven than american films, but this takes it way too far. it also show a whole bunch of incompletely drawn characters doing inexplicable things. it's not fantasy, it's not even surreal, it's just awkward and bad.what's the message here? that people in france are pensive and gaze morosely a lot? that they like to watch other people having sex? they they spontaneously scream or touch a stranger on his neck? do not wear a watch when seeing this film, as you will be astonished at how little is explained or learned over huge stretches of time.this is the story of a "police superintendent" who is deeply troubled by the brutal murder of a little girl, though actually he seems troubled before then. he is not merely upset at his own personal tragedies, but apparently mentally quite slow, behaving very much like a learning-disabled six-year old child. he stares blankly a lot, walks with arms rigid like a little kid, speaks in meek, simpering, tones, behaves quite oddly in all of his interactions (though no one seems to notice or care, even when it is supposed to be police business). he's not a troubled cop, more of an outpatient. picture andy kaufman's latka character on taxi, but without the humor. he is not only not believable as a policeman he is not believable as an adult. that he won an award for this interpretation of his character is truly amazing -- unless he was playing the part exactly as written and the fault lies with the weirdos who scripted this thing. the plot is clearly secondary. do not expect to see anything remotely like what police would do if a little girl was found murdered. this not that important, though the implausibility of their behavior is sort of insulting. the problem is that the rest of the film makes no sense either. that leaves the long lingering close-ups of fields, vegetable gardens, people's faces etc. the ending struck me as especially ridiculous -- totally unsupported by the events leading up to it -- unless you think, "what's the worst way this film could end?"there is lots of sex and nudity, which is supposed to mean something. you want vaginas? you'll see vaginas. not to worry, it's art. it has deep meaning, what i am not sure. and the protagonist, despite his innocent weirdness, seems to have some sort of homoerotic neck or jowl fetish.finally, the subtitles are in white and frequently appear on a white background -- very hard to read many of them. on the other hand, there isn't much dialogue, so this isn't a big problem. there is also very little sound -- not even ambient sounds you would expect to hear -- in the film, contributing to the emptiness of the whole experience. the old woody allen would have had a field day parodying this work.that this is an award-winning film is sad. i would hate to see the losing films.enjoy.

the director infuses this film with false depth by repeating a gimmick throughout the film. every single shot in this movie is 3 times longer than it needs to be. you could easily cut out 1.5 hours of this agonizingly long 2.5 hour film without eliminating: one word of dialogue, one image, one event, or bit of movement.this was one of the most gratuitous wastes of film i have ever seen. other reviewers have called it pretentious, which is an understatement. l'humanite is pseudo-intellectual trash designed to be anti-hollywood so that the cannes judges could assert their independence from the oscars.the imdb reviewer states: "unlike hollywood movies - which usually force the audience into overdrive - this forces the audience to slow down and look at some of life's tiniest and most mundane features in great detail." you would have to be catatonic to stare at some of these images this long and move as slowly at these characters. this isn't real life unless you are heavily medicated.finally, i felt that schotté's portrayal was a sad rip-off of peter sellers' masterful "chauncy gardner." he uses the same facial expressions and postures. he even gardens! in many respects there are parallels between these two movies. the main difference being that "being there" moves along and doesn't rely on shock and gimmicks to create a meaningful experience while questioning various things we take for granted in life.

this two and a half hour long film was shown recently at carnegie mellon university (cmu) at a 10 pm show. there was a scheduled 1 am show after that, but wondered if anyone was going to stay awake to see that until 3:30 am. the opening scene is of a man walking in a field, and it lasts four minutes of movie time. it is an ominous sign of what's to come: a good 144 minutes more of pretty much the same. there is a scene of a man and a woman against a wall, standing in the sun. it is repeated 15 times, with very sparse dialogue. occasionally, these very long slow sequences are interrupted by shocking stills, such as a close up of female genitalia, shown for one full minute of film time (audience crowd laughing in the last 20 seconds, as to say, "what's the message?"). the story resembles dostoyevsky's novel "the karamazov brothers", in which a cretin falls in love with a woman of easy morals. in one of the rare instants in which the crowd was laughing (more in desperation to try to justify having been there already a full two hours to see nothing happening) was when the statement by a british tourist that he couldn't see things clearly since the eurostar train was traveling at 180 miles an hour, was translated by the translator with automatic switch of units of measure from english system to metric system to "they couldn't see things clearly since the train was traveling at 300 kilometers per hour". what was amazing about this movie is that the quality of cinematography reveals that alot of money has been spent on it. this was no film kitchen 8-mm experiment. it was carefully planned, structured, acted, montaged. yet, i got so little out of it. some comments indictated on the excruciating detail, such as the minutae of a dandling key chain on a door just opened. okay, it was noted, but what was the purpose? some corageous people in the audience walked away after the first hour. the rest remained out of curiosity: there must be something happening at the end. there never was. and maybe that's what the film is about. all the movies at the theater are action-packed. this one wants to be different. there is nothing happening.

the premise of the movie had much going for it, however, despite the novelty of models selling off someone else's furniture to live the high life, this movie has nothing going for it. the characters are cardboard. the dialog is so painfully scripted, it's hard to sit through, and if there were any jokes in the movie, i missed them. marilyn monroe's walking into walls because she doesn't want to wear glasses is completely unbelievable & not funny. grable's stupidity is also too ham-fisted to be believed. bacall's gold-digging is so forced, it's annoying to listen to. why anyone would want to sit through this is beyond me.

keep away from this one. the worst thing is the appalling story. there seems to be an intent to convey some subtle spiritual/love/friendship message but it is so pathetically devoid of any substance you can't help but cringe. in addition, the majority of screen time is a far below standard story of thieves, criminals and our hero(es) dealing with some alien time travel artifacts. i know you are asking for trouble when dealing with time but the story is more full of holes than usual. also you have: cheap sets, bad acting and some of the worst music arrangements in the history of the moving picture, overpowering, cheap, abrupt and disjointed. all i can say is "man alive ! this film is bad !"

this horrible action  sci-fi movie is a crap. i have just spent 90 minutes of my life watching one of the worst movies i have ever seen. the story does not make any sense, there are lots of flaws in the screenplay, the characters are badly developed, the unknown cast is horrible, the lead ham actor seems to be too old for his role. i was induced to buy this vhs, which has a magnificent cover, and see this crap due to the illogical imdb user rating and some "ten stars" reviews. i have just checked the authors, and each one of them has just one short review (of "l.i.n.x.") issued in imdb, and nothing else. why are they promoting such a garbage? my vote is one.title (brazil): "l.i.n.x. conexão letal" ("l.i.n.x. lethal connection")

ok enough already. this is a terrible piece of television. the camera work is appalling (do i have to remind you of the crunchy gravel so loud you can hardly hear the actors speak) lady bertram has the most annoying voice in the entire world. anna massey is 'acting' in such an unbelievable fashion. and the lack of chemistry between fanny and edmund is beyond beyond. also the bertram girls aren't pretty enough, and the guy playing henry crawford is awful. to say the camera work is dodgy is an understatement. i watched this adaptation over christmas, and i think under any other circumstances i would not have been able to endure this, and certainly would have not been able to justify the wasted time.i am a fan of faithful to jane adaptations. so i could not bear the film adaptation or the recent pride and prejudice movie. but see any other adaptation instead, even emma is better than this.

total crap.i was kind of excited to see this as it is the only film version i have seen of mansfield park. i suffered through the first four episodes but when it came to the proposal scene between henry and fanny i snapped and had to turn it off. whoever employs this sylvestra le touzel lady has got to be both blind and deaf cause the woman is the worst actress i've ever seen in my life. the whole thing is just bad, bad, bad. i don't know. i just don't know why people who write jane austen screenplays seem to be incapable of giving her work the respect it deserves.

i always try not to be harsh while criticizing something that i didn't like, but after watching this mini-series i was so disappointed that could not help my irritation. on the one hand, it is true that series stayed faithful to the novel and of course i found that very nice, but on the other hand terrible casting, poor acting, especially of key characters  like funny price, impression of stage play, i mean theatrical way of acting makes you irritate from the beginning to the end. i am sure with this budget, even if it was low, could have been done something much better and worthwhile. it is up to you to watch this series, but personally i don't advice you to spend your time on this disappointing ecranization.

this is a big disappointment. the main problem is the acting. sylvestre le touzel is pretty poor as fanny, and the rest are not much better, everybody is very stilted and unnatural. also the camerawork is very 1980's ie cramped and jumpy, compared with the likes of 1995's p&p, for example.the script is, if anything too faithful to the book, and there are some cringe worthy expressions that should have been cut.in every way this is far inferior to the recent film version, which though it took huge liberties with the book, seemed far more faithful to the spirit of the book and was far more enjoyable.

this movie is about a young girl who goes to live with her rich cousins falls in love with one of her cousin, and reject the advance of a amoral suitor who brings trouble on the family. after seeing the 1999 version and reading the book, i decided to watch the older version. i found it did stay true to fanny character in the book, but it was also boring character. fanny character played by sylvestra le touzel was lackluster; she often appeared to be about to faint. i also did not like robert bourbage who played henry crawford. i could not imagine him being interested in fanny or her cousin maria. jackie smith wood who played mary crawford was okay but the wig she wore was so ugly. i lost interested in her acting and i kept staring at her wig. i kept expecting it would drop off her head. i could also see a slip of her real hair under the wig.

okay, i haven't read the book yet but i have to say that the lead character was miscast. how can i say such a thing haven't read the book you ask? it's simple. as a viewer of this miniseries, i grew irritated by the mannerisms, gestures and look of the lead character, fannie price. it's one thing to be a good person but it's quite another to be a stick in the mud creature who disdains from looking anyone in the face or otherwise meeting their gaze. apart from the overdone "susan b. anthony" profile, she seemed resolute in refusing to look at another person. the scene where edmond is pouring his heart out to her, she is looking straight ahead the whole time, forcing him to do the same. as a result, it was just awkward and i just couldn't fathom anyone being in love with her let alone both henry and edmond. many have said it was true to the book, if that is the case i find it hard to believe that jane austen would create such a character as her lead heroine. it's possible to create a character who has been put upon by others and succeeds in earning their trust and endearment but the portrayal of this character in this miniseries just didn't do it for me.

the whole exercise is pointless. why make the film at all? the lighting is ghastly, but the sound is just a joke. like a high-school production. whoever put the budget together for this film should be drawn and quartered for allowing it to be made without the proper budget for soundmen with equipment fit for recording.so much dialog is unintelligible due to losses in echo or the lack of proximity to the mic. economy should have been made on any other area. the whole production is lifeless and just lame with such amateurish half-arsed production. it lacks warmth, clarity, and has no design to it.

this version of mansfield park, while being extremely accurate to the novel lacked the compassion i felt for fanny which is crucial and central to this jane austen story. this was due to the total lack of acting ability by the actress, sylvestra le touzel. she had no appeal and at times appeared to be either lost in space or out of her depth. the scene she has with her uncle where she breaks down in hysterics was hysterical. she badly overplayed that crucial scene and i actually felt sorry that henry crawford ever cared for her.the polar opposite is the portrayal of mary crawford by jackie smith- wood. what a wonderful actress, in a very difficult part to make that character witty and self-centered, selfish yet vulnerable to love.i have always loved fanny. she is mild mannered but with an implacable sense of what is right, and who she thinks is worthy of respect and admiration. the fanny in this adaptation is too meek and subservient with hardly a thought of her own until near the end of the series. as much as i wanted to like this fanny....i just could not. i suggest skipping this version of mansfield park for the real thing...the novel. fanny will not disappoint...you will love her!

for everyone who has read this book, fanny price ends up maturing into her own woman, a beautiful woman...with a brain. le touzel looks like she is on medication. terrible acting, she just ruins it! henry is a little tall for his character. he is also too effeminate. mary crawford is brilliant. edmond is a little too old. mrs. norris is hysterical- ok, this casting decision works. rushworth is also perfect. yates looks too effeminate also. but, le touzel is simply horrid. this is not a good character for her. poor fanny! i would recommend this movie only because it includes an almost complete textual account of the language austen uses in the novel. the 1999 version is much more fun but terribly incomplete. if they could redo this version with a better suited actress for fanny it would be fabulous!

here is another low quality movie from the "disney" company. there is no more disney spirit. the story is boring. all emotions are fake. it is not cute or moving. disney company was at a time a sort of magic company which provided dreams for children. it is now all about making money. shame on the people who exploit disney name for their personal benefit. it is the fall of an empire. and, by the way, pixar is not disney !

as an avid disney fan, i was not totally impressed by this movie, certainly not motivated enough to catch it in the theaters. i am, however, so glad that i caught it on dvd and watched the special features.you must check out the "moose commentary": the entire movie can be viewed with commentary from rutt and tuke, the comic relief moose of the story, who are voiced by rick moranis and dave thomas. two veterans of the famous second city comedy troupe ad-lib - in character - for an hour and a half about a movie that they are clearly fond of. i laughed the whole time. the enjoyment i got from this commentary completely made up for the tepid reaction i had to the film itself. do yourself a favor and listen to it!

being a great fan of disney, i was really disappointed when i watched this garbage.the animation was pretty,and the backgrounds were amazing,but i believe that good animation does not make up for a weak script,and weak story. i'm gonna have to disagree with the people who say it is not suitable for children.yes there are some deaths in the movie but isn't death something that children should at least be exposed to? but i digress. the script is riddled with bad puns and lame jokes...the kind i could expect from most dreamworks movies. the music was soppy,the morals forced(and forced without any charm whatsoever.)and the characters would burst into song at totally inappropriate times.the characters were also cold,and i really couldn't muster up any form of emotion towards them(bar irritation). i am a great fan of jungle book,aladdin,and emperors new groove, but this disney movie was a total and utter waste of time.....do not watch it!!!

the animation is great, i'll concede to that. but disney perpetuated every stereotype we alaskans have been trying to overcome for the last two generations. and the names, i mean, come on...sitka, kenai, tanana & denahi (cheesy takeoff of denali)?! those are real places where real people live! and the real people these real places were named for are probably struggling out of the earth seeking vengeance over this trite little flick. disney, you're based out of california & florida, right amidst the rest of the states that still treat us like a foreign country. if you can't stick to what you know, at least hire and/or work with people who know what area you're trying to caricuture. maybe then it wouldn't be so insulting! :(

recycled and predictable plot. the characters are as memorable as the story line. we came in few minutes late and only saw the end of the opening scene which turned out to be a good thing since it was too intense for a 3 and a 4 year old. overall a disappointment.

man kills bear. man becomes bear. man/bear meets bear. man/bear stays man/bear after meeting bear. the end. seriously, that is the entire plot to this movie. yes, i simplified it to an extreme, but you get the picture. i just wish i maybe had not have seen it.the 'man/bear' alluded to is a native american indian that kills a mother of a cub. and while that can be touching, it certainly lacks to really draw in on the potential conflict between the two parties. plus, there was a certain misuse of the two moose in the film. but that is beyond the point.overall, very much under par. certainly needed a lot more to be entertaining. maybe more laughs from the secondary characters and more drama between the two main bears. thats what separates bad films from the good ones. "d"

4 out of 10a somewhat unbelievable storyline with some haunted-house type "shocks" that really don't fit in.gary oldham's performance is very erratic...not so much the quality of the performance but the consistency. his character does not behave in a consistent manner. sometimes calm/relaxed/methodical/thoughtful, sometimes violent/loud/almost crazed. it's just not believable. have many 80s movies dated badly? will they be more enjoyable 20 years from now?

the blame of this terrible flick lies with the director, martin campbell. after viewing a few of his credits in later years, this must have been one of his first directorial gigs. he had a more than decent cast to work with but unfortunately he had no idea what he was doing. there were scenes that made absolutely no sense at all. where was his head...............was he on drugs? i was looking forward to this movie just because of oldman & bacon. maybe it was a short shooting schedule and campbell just had to "bang it out". i can't imagine that the story that campbell directed even came close to the story that the writer wrote. oldman & bacon, along with the rest of the cast, must have slid under their chairs if they went to the screening. as one poster pointed out, karen young did do a pretty good fight scene with bacon. she really did 'let loose'. it's unfortunate that i have to fill in more space just to stay within the guide lines of what the imdb requires because i really don't have anything more to say about this uninspiring film. one does not have to be forced to be a 'windbag' when criticizing a terrible flick and wish that the imdb would change the amount of words to fill up a critique.

i am sorry but this is the worst film i have ever seen in my life. i cannot believe that after making the first one in the series they were able to get a budget to make another. not that the budget could have been much - this is the least scary film i have ever watched and laughed all the way through to the end (actually i can't believe we watched it to the end) but i think it is because we couldn't quite believe it.

some would argue this is better mainly because of the acting; but it is indeed far worse for reasons that outweigh the improvement.the source from which all the problems stem; the story. aside from one of them people being shot point blank, with a shotgun, in the chest and surviving for hours without medical attention, there is a bigger problem. nic, the gangsta with the golden heart is willing to do anything for the friend he just met that day; and that includes asking an evil spirit for help. ce-ce, who comes out of nowhere with a past in voodoo, is willing to summon killjoy, so long as nic can "hook her up." the acting, while improved, is still horrid. these people couldn't convey emotion out of a paper bag. the script doesn't help them either. stupid lines, and i can only assume no direction from the director. this script was read like shakespeare in high school with a teacher whipping them as they went.while this movie (if you can call it that at its 80 min. run time (thankfully)) is perhaps even funnier than the first because of all these things, it is definitely more painful to watch. 1/10.

there is a fantastic song in killjoy 2 that goes on about how clowns are usually really nice and fun but killjoy is a killer. i don't recall the song in the first movie but when singer olimpia fernandez sings 'killjoy, yeah killjoy 2' is sounds like the 2 may have been added in for this dire sequel. the film is much worse than the first movie and that was really bad. this time the cast, including the usually excellent debbie rochon have given up trying and director tammi sutton creates no tension and presents merely a dull and steady film. full moon pictures produced this during their 'urban' phase, none of which was very good but none so bad as here.

it would be wrong and reprehensible of me to advise you to watch killjoy 2, you must have better things to do, washing the car, throwing stones in a stream, but at the same time it's nowhere near as awful as you probably think it is. it's almost a proper film, which a lot more than most straight-to-dvd sludge can manage. killjoy 2 is helped a great deal by trent haaga's manic turn as the eponymous clown, he throws himself into the role with such fevered abandonment that he almost tips the scales in the movie's favour, but, of course, it takes more than one man in big shoes. tammi sutton gives the most entertaining director cameo since roger corman in creature from the haunted sea and the whole thing is nearly destroyed by the rushed, sugary ending. all over the place and almost good fun.

i have never seen the first killjoy film, and i have also never heard a good thing said about it. so i see killjoy 2 in the local blockbusters and pick it up and look at the back. starring trent haaga and debbie rochon it boasts. now being the massive troma fan that i am there is no way i'm not going to rent this film out, how can it possibly be bad with these two init? oh how wrong i was. even trent and debbie cant save this excuse of a film from being as bad as it truly is. trent quite frankly stinks as killjoy although this probably is more the fault of the writers giving him some of the worst one-liners in the history of film. debbie does put a solid performance in but it isn't enough. the kills are terrible as are the gore effects. for example check out when the guy is supposedly impaled on something or other. and just to top it all off the ending is just amongst the worst i have ever seen in movie history. the film doesn't even work on a so bad it's good level. avoid like the clap.2/10

one day i thought to myself....what is the worst possible thing that could happen today? i answered my self with a simple," oh, it already happened. i rented killjoy/killjoy 2" on dvd. well, what is there to say? the budget was not large enough to rent a police uniform, the movie cuts out sex scenes and death scenes. there is one funny line that i can remember, and the acting is far worse than the first one. there seems to be no lighting on the "set" (the woods somewhere) and the killer clown known as killjoy (who makes leprechaun look like the exorcist)is less than spectacular. this time, he is not portrayed by angel vargas and is completely changed as a character from a crazy irritating clown to a different kind of crazy irritating clown that says "child" a lot. somewhere between freddy krueger and a blade of grass... lies this version of killjoy. somewhere between a pile of dirt and a pile of s---t lies killjoy 2. it's badness is underrated. this movie does not have any redeeming qualities, except the song at the very end over the credits... which at leas provides some enjoyment. killjoy 2 is not even really a movie, so much as an exercise in tension. killjoy 1 is at least good enough to be considered as the worst movie i have ever seen. minor spoiler######### let me describe one of the supernatural kill scenes. a girl is locked in a wood shed of some sort (maybe an outhouse?) when killjoy peers in through a hole. he has some small chattering teeth (like the ones you can buy at spencer's gifts) and he does something with them (maybe winds them up?!). then he holds them in his hands and says a terrible line (which can't be written on imdb). from what i gather of this scene (not from what is shown by the movie) the teeth went into the outhouse and killed the girl in some interesting, but unshown way, and then came back to killjoy. if i were those teeth i would have run. run far from killjoy so he could never ever get his hands on me again. killjoy 2 is hopefully the last killjoy we will have to endure. even as a fan of movies others would say are very bad, i think that this "film" could unify the human race and create world peace if it were promised that this film and anything reminding us of it would be destroyed. i give it 2/10 - simply because the creators succeeded at making the pictures move.

killjoy 2 is the same as killjoy 1. bad acting, bad characters, annoying clown, bad lines, you name it. honestly, i'm not all that surprised that more people haven't seen this movie. the only reason i watched killjoy 2 is because i wanted to think that the filmmakers learned from their mistakes. they didn't. this movie is just as bad, if not worse, than the first one. that clown.... that goddamn clown.... i hate him! i hate him so much! and i don't hate him because he is a good villain... i hate him because he is annoying beyond belief! i hope that the filmmakers realized after trying and failing again that this movie is unrepairable. the last thing we need is a killjoy 3.

i really don't know why i agreed to watch this movie, but like a complete fool i did and for that i deserve to be shot! i had seen the original killjoy, well i say i have seen it.... i started watching it but found it that bad that i ended up watching it in 4x speed to get it over with and get rid of the annoying dialogue, but i said i would watch it and i did even if it was in 4x speed.to cut a long story short killjoy 2 kicks off where killjoy left off. by this i don't mean the plot, i mean the complete and total bag of dirt known as acting and cheapness. i have nothing against low budget movies, in fact i kinda enjoy them, they are something different from mega budget blockbusters, but this film is just terrible! the acting is diabolical and the script... well i think you could of given stevie wonder a pen and paper, and he would of produced something much better! this movie is just annoying, not to mention the annoying laugh the clown has which is so obviously dubbed! i didn't make it through this movie anyway, about three quarters of the way through it was time to turn it off and throw it through the window. it may of been a rip off to buy as a dvd but as a frisbee it was a mega bargain! please for the love of mankind itself do not watch this muck, it is possibly the worst thing i have ever seen and considering some of the muck i've seen thats saying a lot! my rating on this movie would be.... nailgun to the head/10

cops logan alexander and debbie rochon escort five black juvenile delinquents cross country and end up stranded out in the sticks when their van breaks down. after a deadly run-in with a racist, white trash bitch with a shotgun (played by the director), the survivors take refuge in the house of a blind voodoo priestess. one of the teens senselessly uses a spell to call up killjoy, who finally shows up about midway through this bore in a subpar make-up job and bigger, greasier 'fro that looks like it could slide off his head at any moment. he then proceeds to kill off the stupid characters while spouting some of the worst one-liners heard since hee haw was canceled.the acting from the "teens" is terrible, the dialogue even worse, the fx stink and it looks a lot cheaper than the first film. although i enjoyed him in his earlier troma films, trent haaga (trying to imitate jim carrey here) is awful and no match for the hyperactive overemoting of angel vargas in killjoy 1 (which at least had a few dumb laughs).yet another nail in the coffin for full moon studios, whose reputation as a fun direct-to-vid franchise has completely vanished since the trancers/puppet master days.

chuck norris stars as danny, a cop who took down a hulking serial killer however when said killer escapes, danny knows he is the only one able to stop the terror. however danny harbors a secret, he knows that it was sheer luck that got the terror arrested and even more luck that danny survived, now a final battle is waged but is danny ready? right there in my description tells what the problem of this movie is. norris is playing a wimpy hero who still suffers from psychological trauma. in the hands of a better actor, this concept would be interesting and could make for a great thriller. in the hands of a norris thriller it just makes it ridiculous and hopelessly unheroic. also on board is american ninja's steve james and superfly's ron o'neal but any attempt at character development is defeated by the atrocious script. also there is hardly any action and i always preferred a norris movie with more fighting and less talking. given the rating on this website, i must not be alone.* out of 4-(bad)

this film could cure sleep disorders, thats how bad it is. the story dragged, and the bad guy is not that scary. you will not even see this one on tbs reruns. this film made me wonder about chuck film choices. he work on a real dog with this one.

this was painful. i made myself watch it until the end, even though i had absolutely no interest in the plot, if there was one. my patience was not rewarded. the ending was even worse than the rest of the film. chucky walks into the hospital with a priest and his concubine says "i do". how vile can one movie be?

well, the hero and the terror is slightly below average in my opinion. yes, chuck is a real martial artist and kicks some butt in this film but it is rather slow and the acting in my opinion is for the most part subpar although i think steve james does a decent job. like my friend ryan, i was confused as to why the psychopath chose to go to the theatre at the end of the film rather than to go after norris's girlfriend. until than, the killer had only killed women. oh, well, i guess it wasn't as predictable as i thought. definitly a film you can pass on.

for a norris movie this is pretty tame. for an action movie it is kind of dull, and as far as predictability goes my friend and i almost had every turn of this movie nailed. it was nice that the killer's every moves were not telegraphed by the cliche's of 80's action movies, but come on, the only non-predictable move defies the plot and the set-up of the editing. mainly, it is said rather early on that the killer (jack o'halloran, whom is one of the few slightly known actors) only kills women. yet, he all of a sudden stops his m.o. and kills men, huh?. i guess it can be construed and rationalized some way, but why is the movie edited to show that he is going to kill women?? yet again, i'm sure that there is a reason (i.e. to build suspense), but why spend the time watching it when many other suspense movies are vastly superior.fans of "renegade" may enjoy the small cameo by branscombe richmond as victor, but his brief appearence cannot save the movie and even a vote of 4 seems generous.

this is simply another bad chuck norris movie. norris plays a cop on the trail of a twisted serial killer of women. he put the guy away three years before, but the guy somehow gets through the bars in the nut house he's in by using what looks like dental floss. then the killer escapes in a cleaning van and drives it over a 400 foot cliff and survives to spend time around a theater undergoing renovation. irish jack o'halloran is the best thing in this movie, but like in superman ii, he doesn't say a word. somehow that's supposed to make him more menacing. ron o'neal of super fly fame and steve james are wasted playing the city's mayor and norris' sidekick respectively. the film also contains the idiotic subplot of norris and his girlfriend having a child out of wedlock; it's so 1980's. when coupling norris' "serious" acting turn with over-the-top musical cues signaling every forthcoming scene in predictable fashion, the film becomes a chore to sit through. the build-up while searching for the killer in the theater is interesting enough with norris crawling through the shadows to discover the hideaway, but the end fight is disappointing after beginning in such a promising way. it's yet another disappointment from cannon films, and it plays like a movie made for television. * of 4 stars.

"hero and the terror" is a fairly dull thriller - a la: no real character substance, predictable plot, and... boring. for a thriller i found this movie slow in working up to its pitiful climax, as it just seemed to drag along until chuck's wife's baby is born... and then it drags on from there until it reaches the end - which i can hardly remember already even though i only saw the film 10 minutes ago.i give this film 3 out of 10 - for the first 10-20 minutes.

i picked this film up from the local family video on sale for $1.50, which was probably the first sign it wasn't going to be good. watching it with 2 friends, neither of them even wanted to finish it because of how awful this movie is. i, strangely, couldn't stop watching it. but this film is definitely a textbook case of how not to make a movie.the plot is simple enough and sounds great: chuck norris has nightmares about a serial killer he put behind bars. the serial killer escapes and his nightmares begin to become reality once more. serial murder, norris, roundhouse kicks... this sounds like a great film.and some of it is pretty good. the flashback scene where a man breaks a ladder with his teeth is intense, a scene where a van cascades off a cliff and gets crushed is amazing -- and i learned how to break out of prison using nothing more than chapstick, gun powder and dental floss. but there is plenty wrong with this movie.one: the editor is a moron. when making an action or suspense film, you have to keep the energy moving. there are far too many scenes that are not crucial to the plot left in this movie, slowing it down and distracting from the overall story. at least 10 minutes could have been cut and the pacing would have improved and the film would be slightly better. two: the sound guy is a moron. apparently somebody tried to film most of this movie in an area where you can't get decent sound, so most of the dialog is voiced over, killing the stereo and not lining up with mouths. also, the music is far too dramatic in some scenes. three: the casting director is a moron. they cast billy drago as a psychiatrist. billy drago is a great cult actor (from brisco county, the hills have eyes, and others) and would have made the proper serial killer or some sort of villain. his character is so vanilla that drago's skills are wasted. four: the writer is a moron. two plots are in this film - the hunting of a serial killer and the romance between norris and his pregnant girlfriend. every time i saw that woman on screen, i wanted to claw my eyes out. and sure enough, she never figured into the other plot, making her story completely pointless.will i ever watch this again? maybe. but unless they remaster this film at least a dozen times, you never should. not recommended.

when i was young, i was a big fan of chuck norris. i just begun getting out all his old movies on video so i can see them through adult eyes. i remember that i really liked this one in particular, and thought it was one of his best. now that i'm a little older, i can say that although it's thoroughly average, i still consider it one of his better films. in an acting stretch for him, norris plays a cop haunted by his participation in the arrest and capture of a dangerous serial killer movie. serial killers are all the rage nowadays, and people would like to think of them as a wholly 90s invention. in contrast, it's good to see where the current infatuation has sprung from, most obviously, action movies (as well as stalk n' slashers) of 70s and 80s. while norris attempts at both humour and any form of human compassion are ham-fisted and laughable, nobody could kick someone in the head quite like chuck. being a big fan of steve james also, i can recommend this film, ditto for genre legend billy drago, as well as seeing mitch from the blue brothers in a supporting role. not great, but it's better than anything norris did in the 90s.

if anyone at national lampoon is reading this please stop the crap your pulling out of your bum, really now! why the hell are you doing movies like these? they're not funny and watching it for the sexual content is a complete waste of time, really. it is such a horrible movie you may want to shoot yourself while your watching it. i am serious here, guys, it makes harol and kumar go to blah blah blah look like an actual good movie (and we all know that h&k is one of the worst movies ever made) it really sucks, it really does. how bad it is? well, even losers that actually like national lampoon shall hate this movie...they'll want to murder the director, i swear to god. i hate you, national lampoon, die already. die.

i love movies in this genre. beautiful girls, toilet humor, gratuitous nudity. so why didn't i like this movie? no movie like this should add even the slightest confusion to the plot. who's who, where is the money, it's not se7en, just make me laugh. maybe it's me, but i never felt this frustrated watching american pie movies or any other more modern national lampoon's movies. this movie has no flow that keeps me smiling, waiting for what's next. instead, i find myself stopping to think, "why did they keep that scene?" i do not recommend this movie. if you are expecting van wilder, think again. the only fun i had watching this movie was guessing what movies the actors were in when they were kids. 2/10 generously.

this movie was like a gathering of people that had been in other movies and they decided to make a really bad movie. it had a dude from "detroit rock city", a girl from "the cosby show", that dork that kissed the chick and bought that sausage was in "sorority boys" and there was more. ok that doesn't make a bad movie in itself, that was just something i noticed. the whole thing with the hooker and the french girl having the same name was dumb and the thing with 37 people writing these notes and if you think they are going to get mixed up.....shocking enough.......you called it. and the purse thing, that was just plain stupid. it was so bad that i watched the movie in two parts and still only made it to the 50 minute mark. if you are watching this and expect "van wilder" or a movie like that......don't.

this was the worst movie my wife and i have ever seen. the only concessions is that we did not pay to see it at the movies as we rented this on dvd from the video store. simply - no plot worth mentioning (i only watched it 5 minutes ago and already i have forgotten), annoying characters played poorly by two-bit actors and if this was suppose a comedy i am still waiting to laugh. in fact the only laugh we got out of the movie was that we joked with each other that we agreed it was truly awful.put simply this movie was quite utterly pathetic and i warn others to not waste their time. a travesty of the national lampoon name , rating 0/10.

look at the all the positive user comments of this movie, then check to see how often each one posts user comments. they post once. it seems companies are probably paying for services which post junk pro-movie comments on imdb.this movie was awful. the plot was stupid. the acting was poor. the jokes weren't even funny. the movie included minor nudity from what looked like porn actresses but none of the other characters.it was clear from the first 15 minutes that movie wasn't funny. there was some slapstick here and there but most of humor was supposed to be derived from the characters talking behind each other's back and spreading rumors. this isn't even done well. every joke is obvious and you see it coming.the movie is worthy of fast forwarding or better yet not watching.i regret watching this movie and if i could charge the studio and distributor for 1.5 hrs they stole from me i would.

a stupid teen supposed comedy that revolves a serious of misunderstanding including (but not limited to) a hooker being confused with a foreign exchange student, girlfriend beating, a girl loving a gay guy, and the straight guy that loves her, and bitchy gossipers. none of the following is funny or even amusing. nation lampoon's use to be hilarious back in the day. now the name is sadly synonymous with crap. and this one is no exception. i use to think topenga was kinda cute when she was on "boy meets world", but it seems she let herself go (and yes i know she has a name, but into she does anything else worthwhile, she'll stay as topenga) my grade: deye candy: kati lohmann gets topless; boti bliss relies on a body double (booooo!!!)

having been a godzilla fan for many years, gamera was to me a cheap knockoff to capitalize on the success of toho's #1 kaiju star. attack of the monsters was for me at the time (1975) an almost painful viewing experience.last weekend, i attended the annual godzilla fest, known as g-fest, where carl craig, one of the stars of gamera vs. viras, made an appearance. of course, they featured this movie. it was one of the most hilarious bad movies ever made. of course, you have to be in the right frame of mind to watch it. in one scene, for example, the boy scouts held prisoner on board the alien space craft manage to escape by distracting the not-too-bright aliens. when they realize they"ve been duped, one of them says, "that's funny...i think those kids lied to us." not even plan nine from outer space can boast that kind of dialog.this may not be godzilla or even gamera 3, but this one is a decent enough time waster, if you watch it in the right frame of mind.however, if you want top quality kaiju entertainment, check out the recently released gamera 3.rating: **1/2 out of *****

before i speak my piece, i would like to make a few things clear: 1)i am a chick who's not into chick flicks ("kate&leopold" and "someone like you" are extreme exceptions- hugh jackman's ass). 2)i only picked this one up because i am a fichtner fangirl who looked forward to see him in a bathtub. 3)i am not a demi fan, though i think her performances in "immortal" and "a few good men" were sublime and have earned places in my vid library- also i think she's a little crazy (no way is she not still sleeping w/brucie).if this is a character study of an unfulfilled woman living dual lives of independence and happiness, then i'd say we have one narcoleptic melodrama. marty: literary agent. makes 6-figure salary. lives in an upscale manhattan penthouse. easy for her to read several hundred manuscripts and fall asleep at her desk for some highly suggested nocturnal escapism. or perhaps stepping through an interdiemsional portal? she has the career, the looks, a cool car, a great pad, now where are the man and kids? in steps our boy aaron- some real escapism. what are architects? they're artists who can do math, dreamers that make real money. aaron gives marty the dream of security and fills a void where she, obviously has no self confidence.on the other side of the coin, there's marie, still living out her schoolgirl fantasies while she muddles through motherhood. her children are her career and life. but what about marie, does she only exist through her children? in waltzes william, a parisian stranger who helps her focus on the one thing she has lost touch with: herself.a supposed journey of self-discovery and late a coming of age thrown in some with angst and some resentment to marty/marie's own mother. this gets a 3/10. all i could say is thank god for the bpl multimedia division, i wouldn't waste my $2.99 at blockbuster on this, put it toward a harlequin blaze title.

i went to see "passion of mind" because i usually get a kick out of the genre of alternate reality romances, i.e. "sliding doors," "me, myself, i," etc. but this was the worst one i've ever seen! i had to force myself to sit through it. i didn't even stay through the credits which is unheard of for me.the magical realism was completely missing because demi moore was grim and the lovers she was two-timing were guys who usually play villains, though each was kind of sexy and appealing.there was actually a psychological explanation provided for the dual lives, with a distasteful frisson of the elektra complex; maybe the magic shouldn't be explained for this genre to work.(originally written 5/28/2000)

i had the misfortune to catch this on a flight recently. i had the bigger misfortune of having it played on my return flight as well. obviously demi's attempt to get some "arty" cred, the movie is a shambles because of her lousy acting ability. a better actress might have made this work, but a simple look at the face of moore shows the emptiness within. at least she's not ruining american literature this time out.

this movie defines the word "confused". all the actors stay true to the script. more's the pity, because the acting is fine, but the script is a confused pastiche of pseudo-psycho-analytic random ideas. the pacing is mind-numbingly slow, and the soft-focus-lens cinematography gets on the nerves quickly. i give it 4 out of 10.

enough talent and sincerity went into making this film that i wish it turned out better. everyone is clearly doing their best to be true to an intriguing premise, but it's too deep a vision, too involved attempt at disentangling mental delusion to survive a transition to the screen. it is an attempt to capture the dimensionality of gossamer patterns on celluloid -- the result is muddled and slow. i give it a 10 for effort, but a 5 overall.

this film was a mexican made horror film from the late 60s. it's not that good, but really not so bad either. there is plenty of schlock and it is padded pretty heavily with nudity and violence, but it had a plot and at least tried to keep to it (even if the plot was the same damn frankenstein inspired "don't tamper in god's domain" b-movie fare). there was some padding mixed in with the female wrestling, but it was made in mexico and wrestling does seem to be popular in mexico.the plot is that a doctor wants to save his son, who is dying from leukemia. the other doctors have given no hope for the poor guy, but dad has the idea of transplanting a gorilla's heart for his son's to save his life (i don't know, i'm a lawyer not a doctor). the transplant works, but sonny-boy ends up becoming a man-ape who terrorizes nude women and kills anyone who gets in his path. there's also a subplot involving a cop and his girlfriend who is a wrestler (this really didn't add too much, but if they wanted to throw in some masked female wrestlers here's a good reason to do so).the film was kind of cheap, but not too bad for a b-movie of the day. the plot was basically just recycled and there were a few things that weren't tied in that well. however, this film is kind of fun in its own way (i don't know why, maybe because it's a mexican horror film and sticks out in my normal bad movie diet). i guess it may be because it's a mix and mash of some very weird things.watch it if you like cheesy foreign films, nudity, and female wrestlers.

mmmm, a previous summary says "if you like aliens and predator you will enjoy this film" i could not disagree more, this film pays no respect to its weighty lineage and has reduced two of the best loved sci fi strands to little more than a teen horror slasher movie, it has none of the tension or foreboding present in previous alien or predator movies and there is no discernible lead character, i really did not care about any of the characters and i positively yearned to see the stereotypical cast die as soon as possible in the vain hope something better would replace them, it really takes super human incompetence to have two of the most fearsome creatures ever invented positively fail to make a gripping thrilling movie, only watch this if you want to see how not to do it.

if you like me enjoy films with plots and convincing actors then alien vs predator- requiem is probably not the way to go. in summary, alien lands in typical american town, predator lands in american town, both have a bit of a fight, us government blows up town, some people get away.....i'm sorry i think i might have spoilt the ending. its easy to criticise someone who's being critical; people cry out, i bet you couldn't do any better! i bet i could ! having made this film,watched it and then turned to congratulate each other with a pat on the back and a job well done; there must surely have been the spectre of lunacy in the room.

holy crap, the beginning picked up where the first one left off (good start). then it goes downhill from there. you it looked like as if you were watching tv and you keep on switching between this teenage soap opera, a predator movie, and some crappy detective show. the characters that are introduced in the first ten minutes don't have anything to do with each other until the final 45 minutes or so (the characters of the teenage soap opera and the actual alien story).then for the end the producers were quickly running out of money and decided to end the movie so they decided to drop a nuke on the city.p.s- what the crap is the deal with the cameras being so zoomed in you can't tell what's going on? seriously, movie makers, do a good job with fight scenes and make it to where we can see the fight.

where to start?? i think only three other films have led me to post a review on imdb, and all of those were positive. as for this..?mind-blowingly, hideously, tragically, embarrassingly, catastrophically, stupidly, irritatingly, completely and utterly beyond awful.i am stunned this got made, never mind given a theatrical release. i think i am literally in shock.i'm no "snob". i didn't expect beautiful film-making or intense character-depth, but this is truly beyond a joke. we simply must demand more from the films we see.avoid. like the black death.

this is the worst movie i've ever seen, and it takes the price of the rotten movie of 2007 (which is made by me), anyway this movie misses every single ingredients of a good movie, i mean come on the actors had a bad performance, the story is just crap. i'm really, really disappointed they could have done better stuff, than this piece of junk. i've just wasted my time and my money on this movie. i wish that the production company could give back my money. anyhow i'd high expectations on this movie, and i've got disappointed. i don't recommend anybody to watch this. so if u wanna waste ur money on something do it on some thing else than this piece of junk.

if you are a fan of either of the two origin franchises (aliens & predator...duh...and even if you liked or disliked avp flick in 06) you will hate this movie. the innumerable plot holes, flakey and unbelievable human characters, terrible special effects and even worse directing and fight scenes make this one of worse films i've ever seen.***spolier*** one of the hundred huge plot holes included the pred/alien hybrid going from chest burster, to full-grown bad-ass in seconds (it takes off on an onboard predator-ship killing spree and wipes out a ship of preds before the ship even breaks earth orbit.) as if. in the first avp we saw a ship of sr. pred hunters drop off three juveniles hunters going on an "earning their stripes" hunting party, and then in the end saw them picking up the "honored body" of the juvenile that was left over at the end of the flick. are we expected to believe that the single chest burster hybrid killed all these sr. hunters before the ship even broke orbit? also, (and this was extremely cheap production value on the director/producer's parts) jars and jars and jars of face-huggers somehow magically appeared aboard the pred ship, even though the entire temple complex and queen alien were destroyed in the avp flick. these face-huggers end up playing an intregal part in movie...of course. and how about all these face huggers becoming full-grown aliens in a days time? what a joke. although there were many many more plot holes, i don't think imdb would appreciate me filling up their servers by writing them here.on the flakey and unbelievable characters, well, where should i go boys and girls? where to start...almost all of these goof balls are cliché people from other films or tv shows. the town bad-boy who left to avoid jail time but shows up just on the day everything happens to save the day??? where did i see that? oh yeah, last season on jericho!!! then there's the 20-something town sheriff (a former trouble maker himself) who was best-friends at one-time with the bad-boy. where did we see that? oh yeah, jericho and walking tall! then there's the generic soldier (with no rank) coming home from some generic war-front that isn't met like a long-missed loved one and hero at the airport or bus station, but at her own front door by her daughter and husband. and who is this soldier? what did she do in the army/air force/marines/navy/coast guard? we don't know because the movie never tells us. but ... dunh, dunh, dunh...she was some kind of soldier/airman/marine/sailor/coasty that knows how to drive a stryker infantry vehicle and ...magically... a helicopter!!! this character is just a generic copy of every "coming home" service person...except that she brings home a set of night vision goggles to her daughter that cost several hundred dollars. these are things soldiers have to sign for and don't just "bring home." ugh!the special effects and fight scenes are what pi-sed me off the worst though. these are the things i enjoyed the most in the first movie...watching preds and aliens go at it! the way this was filmed though, the action sequences were so dark and filmed so close up that you couldn't tell what was going on. you couldn't see who was doing what and what was going on as they were fighting it out. all in all, these hundreds of items are going to kill this franchise and the fanchise. no one is going to care anymore about seeing their favorite sci-fi movie monsters, and can only guess that the series will go down from here as producers won't like dump millions of dollars more on a sequel.

i am not even willing to vote a single star for this crap but imdb does't have zero as rating option... worst movie i have ever watched.. story of the movie 1. predator ship crashes on earth 2. one alien and some face huggers are released and they start killing humans. 3. one predator arrives on earth and he starts killing aliens and humans. 4. then one human jet drops a bomb and kills human, aliens and predator. 5. some humans find the shoulder canon of the predator. 6. the end directors should consider refunding money back to the viewers. if still you want to watch this movie, download from some torrent site and say thanks to me for saving you money.. all the movie has been filmed in some dark corner of the earth, you see just dark shadows even in action scenes.. too much violence.. i didn't expect it from a fox movie

anyone who watched "alien vs predator" must've known that the conventions of the "alien quadrilogy" were not exactly adapted for the film. amongst some of the unusual elements, the rapid growth of the aliens over seemingly a matter of minutes, aliens with extremely long tails, and so on. however the idea of the predator species providing the impetus of city and temple building to create a hunt for would be warriors sounded so appealing that i couldn't resist.i had hoped the end of the film would not be the impetus of this sequel, and unfortunately i was wrong. for those who forgot how the first film ended, the dead predator had an alien burst through his chest which carried the traits of both species'.for this film, i'm going to just go through a list of "good" and "bad" traits.the good: lots of gorgeous people, especially the men. the bad: lots of gorgeous people get munched by both the mutant predator/alien, and the predator.the good: an interesting idea of the predator planet. the bad: an inconsistent scale of a town. its a small town without many opportunities, but with a very sophisticated (read: big city) sewer system, and homeless. is it a small town, or a city? the police force is one sheriff and three deputies, or so i counted.the good: um.... the bad: why do these mutant aliens/predators grow so fast? in a matter of five minutes, they seem to grow to their full size. i mean, c'mon...what are these things...chia pet aliens??? and while we're on this subject, why is it that an alien inside a predator's body mutates, but an alien in a human's body doesn't? does that make sense?the good: still thinking... the bad: why would only one predator come? and why does it pour acid over all the remnants of the "aliens," but it decides to murder a cute deputy, and then skin him and hang him upside down. i mean, so much for being incognito!the good: ah...i'm stuck. i guess there's lots of loud sounds! the bad: how do these mutated alien/predators procreate? apparently they find a pregnant woman and in a kiss type of motion, they deposit several offspring into the woman's body. yeah, just what you'd like to see, eh? pregnant women having their bodies explode into mutant aliens- as if the previous way wasn't gross enough!!!. i mean, there isn't even an alien queen.the good: did i say that the guys in this movie are gorgeous? the bad: when a nuclear device blows apart buildings, how does a helicopter manage to survive the blast? and how tacky is it for one of the passengers to mockingly chide the pilot "i told you not to crash!" i mean, given the nuclear fallout, when he wakes up in the morning, he'll have no hair left!!!i could go on and on, but i think you get the message. mutated alien/predator bursts through dead predator's body, grows over the matter of a couple of minutes, kills all the predators and manages to get crashed on earth. more mutant alien/predators are created, while one measly predator comes to earth to destroy this new mutant species. predator kills humans. mutant alien/predators kill humans. humans kill humans. sucks to be a human in this movie, eh?if you're impressed by lots of bangs and bumps, you'll love this movie.if you liked the first, i suggest you skip this sequel.

avp2 is an awful movie. the dialogue was pointless, the acting was pathetic, it had virtually no story line and you can't really tell what the hell is going on half the time due to the continuity errors and plot holes.but! you will love it anyway. because it pushes the boundaries on gore, violence, death, destruction and chaos. they even kill children, newborns and unborn babies in this movie. you will be sitting there thinking "oh my god, that is disgusting" and they surprise you by killing the 'sexy chick who always makes it out alive' when the predator and aliens are fighting in the hospital.it's like the movie industry has said "we know what we did in the first alien vs. predator movie was was bad, so we're doing it again but this time we're getting help from psychopaths with vivid imaginations" it's predicable, moronic and down right pointless....but you will be thinking about it for a while after you see it.

i loved the blood and gore. the kind of violence is what alien and predator movies are about which is no one is spared. this truly answers the question of how it would be like if aliens were on earth. the answer to that is simple. we are screwed. the effects were beautiful. how ever there are some real problems with it.1) the acting was horrible on the part of the human characters side witch almost put me to sleep because of how dry and boring it was which really interrupted the flow of the movie and was very annoying. the writers could have done sooooooo much better. the good part was the alien and predator acting which i thought was done very well for the most part.2) the size of the predator ship was much smaller then how it was in the first avp movie. this i scratched my head on 3) predators having their mask on while still in the ship. this upset people and i cant understand why. its not a plot hole like most people make it to be. so i say to you people calm the hell down. its no big deal. if it will make you feel better, remember, they did have face-hugger's on bored in storage so that could be a good reason why.4) predator firing its plasma caster inside the ship. i thought that was rather stupid on the predators part. but then i began to think if it was a younger predator that panicked.5)the hunter and his son almost instantly arriving at the crash site after it fell several miles away. at least they didn't bore us by showing them run through the woods for 30 min. so be happy about that.6) why did only one predator go? i thought this was odd. but then i thought that it was because he thought it was only one predalien that he was dealing with and not an outbreak.7) why didn't the predators in the ship self destruct? well if people were paying attention one did, but he was killed before he could completely activate it.8) the unlimited blue melting goo. i thought that was rather dumb.9) predator hiding evidence with the goo but skins a cop. that was also dumb.10) the black out. well come on people, an alien and pred did fight it out at a power station.11) predalien being half face-hugger/queen. this really ticked me off. i am an alien and pred fanatic. i know for a fact that aliens do not do that!! just like they don't give birth like a human does like they showed in alien4!! out of all the comics, games, books, and the movies 1,2, and 3, clearly shows their behavior. they need a queen to lay eggs, the eggs hatch into face-hugger's, face-hugger's infect host, the parasite pops out and kills host and grows into a drone if it infects a human, a predalien with a predator, and runner with any kind of four legged animal. and then after living for years upon years then they molt into a preatorian (a mini me queen that does not lay eggs) i can go on and on but i wont. but that scene alone nearly ruined the movie for me. if the directors are smart they would go back and edit that by making a face hugger infecting the pregnant women.any way if you are going to see this movie, just go see it for the aliens and predators. and when the scene comes up where the predalin infects that pregnant women... close your eyes so you don't have to see that insult to the alien and pred universe.

this movie made me watch paul w.s. anderson's avp1 and enjoy it! i am not even going to dream of comparing requiem to any of the alien or predator series' movies,this is a horrible teenage b-horror footage set in an american small town no one cares about.avp1 at least had heaps of handcrafted art carved into the movie sets,it had bags of eye-candy not previously seen in any of the original movies - but was ruined by unconvincing characters/acting.requiem takes bad acting to the lowest imaginable level,and it also lacks in every other department just as much...it's a sacrilege to include alien and predator suits in this kind of rubbish.

ed wood is rolling over in his grave. he could have made a hundred cult classics for the price of this waste-hole. the worst script in memory (it makes "x-men 3" sparkle like "citizen kane"); the most amateur directing; pre-k cinematography; the cheesiest "special effects" (i'm talking about "friday the 13th" sequel territory); and throw in a pointless, revolting, deeply disturbed, maternity ward sequence. the lack of any talent or sensibility that put this garbage on-screen is astounding. that the "industry" might reward anyone involved in this celluloid cess-pool with future projects ought to be cause for serious alarm.

my qualifications for this review? i own all the alien and predator movies & i have and have read almost all the books i can find that are related to this series.i can safely say, this movie is a stinker. save your money & don't waste your time. if you like mindless action, mindless gore, no plot to speak of & like being taken by hollywood, see the movie.if you are a serious alien series fan, send a message to the over stuffed, over paid suits in hollywood & 20th century fox & don't give them a penny.this movie has so many plot holes in it you could sieve pasta through it. read the other negative reviews to get the big picture, it has all be said accurately, so i don't have to repeat them.the characters in this movie are cardboard. you want them all dead. and, the movie doesn't disappoint, almost all of them die. even the hot, bubble headed blond. do you feel sorry for her? nope. no plot, no character development....who cares. the predators are now idiots too. they scan everything but their own dead warrior. they are suppose to be a high technology society, right? in the predator movie, they scanned the soldiers and the girl to determine who was armed. trophy kills. in avp, they scanned charles weyland and let him go because he had cancer. major plot hole!also, the r rating is because they have kids in the movie that get a face hugger, lots of gore and violence and there is one hospital scene where a very large pregnant women is injected with chest bursters. she is implanted by the hybrid alien with 4 or 5 eggs in a mouth-to-mouth love scene-orgy and they all hatch in, say, 30 seconds. sensational gore a plenty, nothing more. these scenes are laughable, not serious. it is almost like the violence happens and the alien looks at the camera and waits for applause, a thumbs up or a nod of some sort.the aliens in this movie are all on performance enhancing drugs. they develop fast and spread quickly all over the town, tons of them, everywhere in record spawn time. pathetic because it does not stick to the series story line and adds nothing to the aliens, aliens predator continuity.i have noticed the positive reviews are written by people who love the gore. laughable. as a movie, as a continuation of the aliens franchise and the development of the aliens vs predator franchise, this movie is a cheesecake cliché at best. if you have faithfully followed this series, all the rules are broken and the aliens and predators are reduced to comic book characters.there is not one fantastic, memorable action scene. there are almost no special effects worth remembering. there are no brand name actors. the plot is as thin as onion paper that ultimately ends with a, "we have two choices to get out of this mess...the hospital or the center of town!". i just about wet myself. the center of town means everyone is going to get nuked by big brother who somehow knows the town has been infested because they have an awac in the air that can see the infestation on a radar screen in special effects red spots. i just about fell out of my chair. special effects red spot alien radar on an awac over middle america. i am splitting my gut laughing.having to get to the helicopter pad made me choke on my popcorn. has anyone played a game called zombies!? you have to get your playing pieces to the helicopter pad to win. i almost wet myself laughing.the ending is enough to make you shake your head in wonderment. who did 20th century fox hire to write this script!? oh, oh, ask me.... a grade 5 student. there really can't be any other answer. oh, yes there can be another answer... low budget cheesecake sci-fi.the ending? "col. stevens takes the predator pulse rifle to ms. yutani (francoise yip). she tells him that the earth is not ready for the technology it represents. col. stevens knows yutani doesn't want the technology to use on earth." you are kidding me, right? ms. yutani? who is ms yutani? (forshadow:weyland-yutani: the corporation) she is in the movie exactly 2 seconds and yet, in her infinite far east wisdom, she says the world is not ready for the technology. seriously??!! the brothers dweebs (strause) as directors? who is responsible for this hemorrhage-abortion of a movie? they are the doug and bob mckenzie of directors and yet fox entrusted the flailing alien franchise to them. they are touted as special effects experts and yet the movie is all low budget special effects. hmmm, i see a pattern. laughable.this movie is only made to empty your wallet. it serves no other purpose. it has no plot. it has no main characters worth mentioning. it is disjointed. it does not adhere to any of the character principles established in previous movies. it does nothing to advance the franchise. the special effects are lame, minimal and low budget. and, it has no ending to speak of. it is low budget and strictly designed to take your hard earned money. nothing more.save your money. either watch it on tv where it will very quickly end up. buy a bootleg or miss this bleeding ulcer altogether. there is a reason why fox did not preview this movie to the critics. the critics would have eaten this mess alive and no one would have gone to the theaters to see it. jr giger, the original creator, is at this very moment, leaning over a toilet spilling his lunch.20th century fox, this movie is a stinker. it is as bad or worse than alien 3. you insult us. flush now...

when i saw alien vs. predator a few years ago, i have to say as stupid as a sequel it was, it was still somewhat enjoyable. now, there are unfortunately a shortage of good movies out in the theater lately, so my boyfriend and i decided to just go ahead and see what avpr: aliens vs predator - requiem was about. so we saw it a couple nights ago and i have to say that there was absolutely nothing thrilling about this horror sequel. it took a completely different turn from the first avp movie, it's not a bad idea that they took alien and predator and put them in the up class suburbs, but from the idea of the first one explaining their reasons for existing, this was just an average and predictable horror sequel. not to mention a story that keeps introducing new characters every scene where i wasn't sure who to keep in mind on who was the main character and why, so i couldn't really keep up with the story.from what i've gathered, of course the predator and the alien are up in space having to deal with the stuff of typical sit com neighbors, they're just beating the lights out of each other and they decide to why not? go ahead and take it out on some earthlings. so they crash and alien is taking over the suburbia utopia. but teenagers, including a troubled couple who look like ken and barbie, a female marine and her daughter, among others, are going to make sure to kick some space butt, that is if the predator doesn't get there first. because he is ticked off at the alien, i guess for starting the party without him, lol, just kidding, actually for killing some of his friends.avpr: aliens vs predator - requiem isn't the worst movie by any standards, it's still pretty cool with a lot of the visual effects and the fight sequences between alien and predator are so cool to watch. like the first sequel of alien vs. predator, the cast is the thing that ruins the film and just seems like they were not well developed, i know it's horror, but the original alien and predator films had characters, that you cared about and wanted to win. but it was a semi-decent sequel that i would say is worth a look for some fun, especially for ken and barbie's sake.4/10

turd pie:* take x2 franchises * par-boil for 5 mins * stir in mixed cardboard characters (non actors work best) * add 2 tons of clichés then bake in your plot-hole microwave until bored. * serve with a sprinkling of dawson's crack (not a typo)voila! - money spinning brain rot for the emo/world of warcraft generation looking for the keys in drain was the best bit (?) aside from the first 5 mins, its one of the worst films ever made. utter, utter, nonsense.

this film and the 1st avp film both all over the whole aliens and predator franchise.they are awful films, badly acted, badly scripted and terribly directed. they just seem like someones desperate attempt to make money off of the good name of the original aliens and predator films but instead of delivering a well thought out, quality production, they came up with the predaturd.the original alien/aliens/predator/predator 2 films were great, they redefined the horror/thriller genre by inventing these insane (and yet still believable) creatures who took the role of the 'serial killer', as opposed to a human. these films are just milking the franchise and do nothing but darken its name.the aliens vs predator comic books were brilliant and had a great story. they were true to the alien/predator mythology, didn't crap all over the original stories etc... why didn't they make the comic book into a great film? because hollywood are idiots, thats why.

if only i had read the review by alex sander (sic) on here rather than looking at the rating of over 6 from a select choice of the ignorant viewing public i would not have seen this desecration. alien was a fantastic, dramatic and well made horror/sci-fi. predator was a great sci-fi/action mess-about. i do really have only myself to blame though as i saw 'alien versus predator'. it too has an average grading of over 6 stars from the connoisseurs of film that frequent this site.stop reading now if you have any fear of this ever so suspense ridden plot being ruined for you.right from the beginning this film was ridiculous. no explanation was offered for the predator ship overrun/not overrun by aliens. ok so maybe they were again going to throw aliens down to earth to hunt them and something went wrong but how did this result in an alien/predator hybrid and why did the rest of the crew not realise sooner despite their great technology? the start was actually the most coherent and interesting part of the film because we had some idea of who was who or what was what and perhaps why. from then on it gets really ridiculous. i always leave my disbelief strictly suspended above the door of the screen before entering and collect it on the way out. i couldn't here.a father and son are hunting in the woods. the damaged ship crash lands to (from the view given) i would calculate at the very least 10 odd miles away through thick woodland. the man and boy track there alone and find the ship and get face hugged. even at this point you feel very little for them mainly because the face huggers are almost comical rather than scary in their movement and actions and the father seems like such an irresponsible, dumb redneck muppet.an edgy, thriller-type scenario is introduced with an ex-con returning to the town near the crash site to be met by his somewhat emotionless, dull now cop friend from the bus. when i say introduced i mean a feeble attempt with crap actors and no feeling is played out. a slasher/horror element is then introduced with a sexy girl and the usual supposedly nerdy or somehow undesirable cute guy who gets beaten up by the over protective, crazy, nasty jock type (american sportsman not a scottish man). oh the cute/not cute boy is the ex-con's brother by the way. yes they're clever these director brothers whose name i will research in order to avoid any other shite they put out again. then a modern role reversal oh so boring attempt at pc, ripley credential type character introduction comes with a female soldier returning home to her husband and child.guess what happens next? i won't tell you much more about the actual (smiles sadly to himself about the demise of storytelling in the large majority of recent films) plot just in case you have got this far and are not the brightest star in the alien-ridden universe.the predator is stupid for the reasons stated by the previous poster whose post i read too late. the aliens are boring. the predator-alien is ridiculous. the action is at times exploitative, gratuitous, disgusting nonsense. the hospital scene with the pregnant mothers?!?! oh i was shocked alright. shocked at how low some people will go to get what? a scare? some shock? to titillate the perverse? what? if you really wanted to shock, titillate and scare people who are not pregnant or expecting fathers or who have no souls why not just have the alien/predator shagging the saucy women and teenage girls rather than killing them? the characters have no depth and neither does the plot. it's filmed and paced badly. it's acted by disinterested people not that i can blame them. it further tarnishes two rather interesting and good sets of sci-fi characters. this film was rubbish and if you gain enjoyment from it i really have to worry about you. if you haven't seen it then well please make your own decision.ps did i even mention the way that trained soldiers are all killed in about 20 seconds while amateur civilians survive throughout?

starting where the last avp left off, an alien "chestburster" emerges from a dead predator on a predator spaceship, and causes the predator space ship to crash into modern day gunnison colorado, where it breeds several more aliens which start to cause havoc. the predator race sends down a lone highly experienced and armed predator to "clean up the mess". our human characters are caught in the middle of the intergalactic battle.the biggest problem with this movie is the pacing. this movie moves along way too fast. the opening credits have only just rolled and already the predator ship crashes into the earth after the alien grows to full hight, a hunter and son character are introduced but before we even get to learn their names they are both killed, then we see the predator home-world and the lead predator flies off to fight the alien infestation, and all this happens within the first five minutes. this unnatural pace does not let up for the entire movie; the national guard comes into town but within two minutes are all killed without even getting a good look at a single ones face, the manager of a pizza store gets one scene of character development only to be killed off the very next time we see him once again without even learning his name, random hobos, a coffee shop waitress and chef are killed again without learning their names. one moment our main characters are at home, the next running around town, the next in a gun store , the next in an apc, and this random set jumping over and over just doesn't ever let up leaving the audience no time to settle in leaving them grasping for straws.another problem is the settings and time frame. the movie is set in modern day gunnison colorado. every other alien and predator movie was shot in enthralling settings, such as industrial space ships, guerrilla war zone rainforest's, alien planets, and underground labyrinths. now comes along avp-r, set in a small modern day american town, with set "highlights" including a sporting goods store, parking lots, pizza shops, and little girl's bedrooms. i mean, were they actually trying to make the movie look as dull, drab and uninteresting as possible?! it's hard to perceive these monsters as frightening creatures when they are standing next to a shelf full of reeboks, or hiding in the bushes outside little girls bedrooms.continuity is a big issue with this film. the alien series was set in the future, no human had even heard of an alien before the first film, and the aliens not only had never been to earth, but if they ever did reach earth, humanity would be destroyed. this movie ruins that entire concept by being set in modern day, with average joes seeing the aliens all over the place, and by the end of the movie, humanity is not destroyed, not even suffering what could be considered minor losses. it pisses all over that entire concept of the other movies. attempts to maintain continuity are made with massive deus ex machina's. the predator just happens to carry around a bottle of unlimited magic blue liquid that's just to melt away any bodies with just a single drop, the army at the end of the movie just happens to go to overly drastic measures and drop a nuclear warhead that just conveniently erases all evidence of the aliens existence despite the fact there were many survivors of the incident who are witnesses, and many more bad attempts are made at filling up impossible to cover plot holes.also, for a "verses" movie, it has unrelenting bias in favor of the predators. for the majority of the film, a lone predator manages to kill dozens if not tens of dozens of aliens, all at mêlée range while barely gaining a single scratch, while the aliens just get slaughtered left right and center like clay pigeons, merely waiting their turn to be killed by the predator without putting forth any effort to defend their selves. this movie should not be called "alien vs. predator", as much as it should be "predator massacres aliens". i mean, how can you have two species battle it out with suspense and tension, when one is portrayed as being vastly superior to the other? the characters in this film are amongst the biggest flaws. not only do they pale in comparison to the characters from the previous alien and predator movies, but even as a stand alone movie they are bland, dreary, and even at times cringe worthy. the characters in this movie consist of i kid you not, horny couples wanting to get laid, pizza delivery boys, blonde bimbos, high school bullies, children, and a blatant copy and paste job ripping off ripley and newt; the worst and most cliché possible ideas for characters. not only that, but all of the aforementioned characters are acted by teenagers. while the casting of teenagers is an obvious attempt to pull in younger audiences, its only effect is to make the movie look and feel like a typical teenybopper slasher-porn movie, with actors who are too young to have learned how to give a convincing performance, with them mostly having completely blank facial expressions delivering monotone dialog. not only this, but these characters do some of the most cinematically retarded things ever, such as using predator guns, commenting the powers out when it has been for hours, following dumb plans to get out of town rather than just walking out of town somewhat quickly, and just so many other idiocies that the movie actually had the audience in my theater sighing out of frustration.in the end this movie is just a horrible b movie, something deserving of the direct to dvd category. the fact this movie was a theatrical release astonishes me, as every part of the movie just ranks of amateur work.

with this movie i was really hoping that the idea was to make up for the hashed together ineptitude of the first avp, and yet to my horror: requiem is far worse than i could have imagined.my hopes were up in the opening moments of the film inside the predator ship, and i almost breathed a sigh of relief when we finally saw the predator home world (a throwaway digital matte painting, but still nice to finally see it) and then of course, the humans (if such poorly written characters can be referred to as such) are introduced...one must wonder why it seems to be impossible for fox to make a good film out of aliens and predators. at the very least the supposed filmmakers could have done their homework.characters are set up in the same manner in which we would expect from the worst friday the 13th sequel. the pizza delivery scene was cringe inducing as was every other scene of character interaction that followed it. bimbos and teen non actors do not make for a real film, they make for a cheap flick, and alien 1-3 and the predator movies were good because they were produced above the concept (remember that the 1st alien is a "b" movie done as an "a" movie) the strause brothers really missed an opportunity, that could have been rectified by simply knowing their alien+predator roots: in both the alien and predator films we are introduced to characters that are part of a larger group (alien: refinery workers, aliens: marines, alien 3: convicts and in the predator films we generally follow a main hero part of a unit; predator, arnold--special forces, predator 2: danny glover, police) and it's easy to see where the filmmakers of both franchises started to go wrong: in alien ressurrection we have pirates...or something, avp we have...explorers?...with guns?? and of course in avp-r we have teen slasher clichés. what is there to identify with here? in concept the idea of a convict returning to a small town and a war vet returning seemed a set up for a first blood type of action hero, but like many things it was never paid off.the film-making is equally devoid of rhyme of reason. there is no sense of forward momentum to the action, just small sequences that build the most minuscule levels of tension or interest only to cut away just when they're getting interesting...taking the audience out of the movie at every turn. the action scenes themselves, though much ballyhooed in the trailers, are so darkly lit, it is literally impossible to tell what is going on during the fight scenes when they finally occur. basically, the movie is hindered from many levels. bad actors combined with poor direction and an atrocious screenplay (which as a screenwriter myself i noticed, seemed to hit every wrong note and cliché that only the most untalented writer devoid of ideas could have hashed together) the writing, if it can be called that, is not even direct to video quality, nor does it demonstrate a shred of respect for the established lore of the previous entries in the series. why does the predalien all the sudden have the ability to shoot alien embryos down a pregnant woman's throat to use her as an incubator for chestbursters? more than likely because the brain dead screenwriter needed a way to have more aliens for the predator to fight (and given the accelerated growth time even more so than the first avp: as quickly as possible. why must meaningless small talk between cardboard cutouts on sticks (meaning the supposed characters)substitute for real character development? (remember a character is defined by what they do, not say). why is the sheriff leading civilians to a cache of guns? (isn't he an officer of the law?) how does the bimbo of all people know where they are? why does the predalien wait for the predator to very slowly remove his mask before it attacks? why are the aliens still falling into that nasty series-post-alien 3 habit of hissing all the time to let their prey know to run? how on earth did this series devolve to a character saying "people are dying...we need guns!" (how this writer even works is beyond me, and reflects badly on fox's already destroyed artistic reputation. it's like everyone involved in the making of this film suffered from a mental impairment or really are that inept at every level of the film-making process. the effects are pretty lousy this time around. the aliens look like men in suits and adi is just getting lazy with their creature design. the aliens look like modified leftovers from alien resurrection, with that same bulky musculature around the arms as if they did not learn from that movie that it was not a good design, nor a good one to recycle. again, everything is shrouded in such a state of darkness not to create mystery or atmosphere, but simply to hide how bad the creatures look. and just like in avp, stan winston is sorely missed when the fake looking predator face is revealed.there are too many faults to list so i will just say this: do not waste your money on this movie. fox is beyond caring about the fans, as this cheap and trashy film is clearly evidence of. i felt bad having taken my girlfriend to see it (though it was free) and apologized to her profusely after. this is one die-hard fan who is done with the franchise.note to fox: what we really wanted wasn't a mindless slasher flick, it was a film adaptation of the original darkhorse comicbook, which was better than anything you've produced for this franchise post 1993.signing off.

i was only fourteen when i first saw the alien movies and i immediately came to like it. original, terrifying and classic. sigourney weaver was the perfect choice for the female hero character and she would have deserved a statuette for her act. in 1979 something everlasting was born than the immortal series continued with a nothing less legendary movie than the first. alien3 was a different point of view but i think this part was the most stressful and unique of all, this was my favourite. unfortunately the last one was a failure in many ways. it was strained, illogical with full of meaningless massacres. i didn't like it at all, but i never thought that a worse part would ever be made in the future. well as it turned out in 2004 i was wrong. alien vs. predator was a bad break, and it should have been directed by a more talented director or should have never been made at all. but when i saw alien vs predator requiem i was totally shocked moreover devastated. when i sat down and decided to watch it with full of doubt, even than i had never thought that such a bad movie could be made. without a screenplay, without a director and without actors i don't understand how can a film be made. because this film misses these three terms. what you get is a nice massacre show without a story but with a lot of annoying and boring dialogues. waste of money and waste of time. this movie is rather impudence, than honor to the fans of the both sides (alien/predator). shame!

i'm sorry to say that this movies was one of the biggest disappointments of the year. following one of the biggest disappointments in movie monster match up history you would think that they would learn from the mistakes of the previous incarnation. the sequel falls into many of the same traps, the plot line was completely forced, the dialog was so bad that the film might be better on mute, and the action was contrived and far from the heart pounding brilliance of each monsters original films. the best part of avp-requiem is in fact the trailer, which as you go through the movie end up realizing that almost every single death and every really cool shot in the movie was already shown in the trailer which leaves little to be revealed and little to be excited about. i gave the movie an extra star for letting see the extra hot female in the almost nude. the movie played out like a color-by-number sci-fi monster fest which also played into the fact that nothing was a surprise when it happened, because you'd seen it a thousand times before. the main failing with both these movies is that the creators thought that setting the films in our time would make us be interested in the story more as if it may one day happen to us. but what drew people in when they released the arcade game back in the day was that it kinda took place within an over the top futuristic version of the alien trilogy time line which allowed more of a suspension of disbelief. this is where the future movies need to draw inspiration from. because to be honest, seeing a waitress killed by the alien we all have feared since childhood just really doesn't do it for us. lets take the series back to its roots. learn from the former masters and don't mess with a winning formula by trying to make a 'bold new vision' we liked the originals for a reason, we want to see that again. lastly, the ending is the real wtf moment of the whole film, *spoiler* after the big climax, the survivors are ambushed by special-ops soldiers who justify their horrific actions by saying 'we were following orders' and then turn on a dime and start acting all nice and are turned into saviors. then after the long pull back with one of the survivors looking ominously into the heavens, we cut to the most bizarre cliffhanger i've ever seen, with characters you never saw in the rest of the movie (save the government dude) then with all the subtlety of a punch to the face they reveal that there will be yet another film with the hint of a plot line that would make a sci-fi channel original movie blush and turn up its nose. so, in summation, if you have to choose between this movie and doing any other activity on the face of the earth, skip the movie and do the other thing instead.

there was a time when the alien series was a success with even the third installment, alien 3, showing promise under the guild of a fresh and young david fincher. the first predator was a box office hit mainly due to its story, "in peak" star arnold schwarzenegger and director john mctiernan (die hard). the films alien, aliens, alien 3 and predator were all highly successful and created massive followings among general film fans and science fiction fans alike. arguably predator 2 and alien resurrection should have signaled the end for both franchises, but studios were undeterred and saw the opportunity to pander to the rumours among fans and combine the two. step in paul w.s anderson, alien vs predator, and now the brothers strauss (visual effects graduates, not even directors or writers). the problem was that by allowing such profound and revolutionary creations of the sci-fi genre to fall into the hands of firstly a mediocre director and now directorial newbie's has led to nothing more than profanity, epitomised by incompetence. upon witnessing alien vs predator requiem (avpr) die-hard fans will feel sick to their stomachs that this series could have got any worse.one example of the cinematic deterioration of this franchise is in the opening scene and is likely to cause nausea among fans. the film begins with an alien making its way onto the predator ship, spurting from the predators chest, growing in to a full grown predalien and bringing down the predator craft (which now seems to have far less predators on it than it did at the end of alien vs predator) and all this occurs with the ship still in earths atmosphere. once the ship has crashed avpr quickly resorts to cheap plot methods and basic narrative conventions, it makes no venture at utilizing any of the twists or subversions served up in the two original films. the wearisome plot progresses with tedious pace, punctuated only by the near rousing conflicts of alien and predator and when that runs the risk of boring us we are treated to either an alluring blonde in a bikini or rapid gunfire. avpr is plagued by an endless array of continuity errors and plot holes with little or no narrative elucidation i.e. members of the public outwitting an elite military unit or the predator not adhering to laws established in previous editions. this is a film that has a complete disregard for its predecessors, it breaks some of the most fundamental rules of a sequel and in doing so one gets the feeling that it is trying to set itself up as a stand alone feature. independently the film has no heart, no conviction and no soul and with reference to the other films lacks even the most basic continuity. this is exemplified by the over arching narrative of the film as it undermines the basic premise of the first alien. because if the species had been encountered before then those in the first alien film would have been more proficient and not so ill prepared when encountering them.on a cinematic note the film is close to being dire, i felt urged at some points to shine a torch at the screen, the lighting was so bad. through utilizing such gloomy and dark effects the audience may feel as though they are being cheated out of some the action  which is ironically its purpose and also indicates the films lack of budget. as with all science fiction one scene normally surfaces as being the most memorable, in this instance it is probably the hospital impregnation scene as it ever so tenuously draws on the themes of the original alien by literalizing it. the directing is poor, performances weak and the script rotten. avpr is the product of a conveyor belt system of film-making in which ideas and techniques are assembled by ineffective people and then the finished product distributed among cinemas. this is personified by the absence of gory death scenes and drawn out blood battles because the certification will not allow it  a lower certification achieving a larger target audience. avpr was purely a business venture and nothing more.

susan slept here turned out to be dick powell's swan song as a performer on the big screen. of course he directed some more films and appeared frequently on television until he died. it's a pity he didn't go out with his performance in the bad and the beautiful.frank tashlin has done so many better films, i'm still not sure whatever possessed him to do this one. the premise is absolutely laughable. dick powell is a screenwriter who's looking to do more serious stuff than the fluff he's been writing. he had an idea for a film on juvenile delinquency so two friendly cops in herb vigran and horace mcmahon deposit 17 year old debbie reynolds on his doorstep. she's not a really bad kid and they don't want to put her in the system. so they give her to dick powell at christmas time.i mean is there anyone out there who doesn't see a problem? the term jailbait comes immediately to mind. additionally powell has a girlfriend, the young and sexy anne francis. why debbie reynolds is any competition here is beyond me.susan slept here got one oscar nomination. the song hold my hand, sung by don cornell in the background, was nominated for best song, but lost to secret love. powell and reynolds do have some funny moments together and alvy moore as powell's factotum and les tremayne as his lawyer also get a few laughs. but it's not enough.

this movie is simply rubbish. i have to say i am an expert of rubbish movies. i reserve the "1" rating for movies that are rubbish but funny, but this film is just tedious and certainly not crappy in a funny way but crappy in a crappy way. it gets a "2" so those of you out there can distinguish between the ones that will make you laugh and the ones that will make you fall asleep. there are scenes in this movie where the actors are looking at something, their expressions are of amazement and there wide eyes and slack jaws tell the audience that what they are looking at is going to be profoundly amazing, this simply isn't it's just a cupboard or even more desert. it has to be pretty god damn awful for me to walk out, let me tell you, i walked out and so did quite a few people.

if you suffer from insomnia then radiant would be the best way to send you into a 7-year coma. the film is so preposterously overwrought and mundane that it's hard to imagine that director steve mahone could overlook such obvious dullness.the story has an exiled doctor (who we never get to see) move out into the desert to create a vaccine that will cure all diseases by filling the hosts full of antibodies that can combat any infection (yes, just like that episode of futurama). the vaccines don't work and the human guinea pigs become infected with a virus that kills within 48 hours.not wanting to be caught by the government guys in masks the group head into the desert for cover, hoping that the sunshine will kill the virus. all of this is narrated by michael, the only one of the quartet immune to the infection. and it's the most boring narration ever. they could have cast someone with an interesting voice but instead we get someone with less vocal personality than clive owen.on top of this the editor insists on fade-cutting more than half the movie, giving it a weird dream-like feel and increasing the audiences desire to go to sleep. it's no surprise that half of the audience walked out of this, i was not one of them for some reason. but i bloody well should have.the ending is supposed to be shocking and clever and foreboding. but it's plain and simply not. a relief yes, but not dramatic in the slightest.the utter cheapness of this production and muffled sound that renders a lot of the dialogue unintelligible cripples what could have been an interesting sci-fi story if it had better actors, cooler locations and a sense of urgency. as it is, radiant is a snoozefest.

well........how and where do i start to describe this utter nonsense? imagine the morals of a cheesy hollywood western, throw in a lavish helping of the most trite soap opera storyline, and try to dupe the kids into thinking its cool by dressing it up to be about something 'contemporary'. this film is all package and absolutely no substance.it starts with promise......young men dreaming of becoming rockstars and engaging in the kind of excessive hero-worship everyone can laugh at. after that, it all goes downhill.....quicker than a bobsleigh with no brakes. the scene involving the first gig with steel dragon is one of the most pathetic pieces of 'cine kitsch' i have seen in a long time. the singer appears on stage for his debut and falls down some stairs.....will he get up and sing???......or will he stay there on the floor and not sing......who cares by now?? it gets worse, but i don't want to bore myself by having to remember it in all its excruciating detail. if you watch it after this review, its your own fault!

this is the movie that is somewhat based on the exit of rob halford from british metal gods 'judas priest' and how the band replaced him with ripper owens, who used to front a priest tribute band. originally titled metal god this movie could have been something great. instead, someone in an office somewhere who knows little to nothing about metal music decided to water it down. from the title change of metal god to the 'safe' middle of the road 'rock star' to the lame soundtrack this movie plays out badly. having spent most of my life in a professional metal band i was really looking forward to seeing this, i was very let down by several points of the film. the soundtrack is very not metal for one, and the ending of the movie is lame as well. the movie does have a few bright spots in the writing and acting but as a whole, it fails in the end because...1)a movie based on a metal band should have a metal soundtrack. 2)there is nothing metal about marky mark or jennifer aniston. if bon jovi, warrant, def leppard and poison are your idea of 'heavy metal' go see this movie. if iron maiden, judas priest, dio & black sabbath are your idea of metal see this movie for a good laugh.

i don't know any idiotic rock'n'roll cliché not used in this movie. ouffcourz , rock enroll life is only sex drugs and parties and tons of supermodels trying to ride with you. say it to stupid young boys. the filmmakers seemed to have read too much guns'n'roses or motley crue stories. i have seen everyday life of usual rock band closely and there are nothing to do with reality in this movie. if you are successful enough your life is touring touring touring. its means that you are mostly in a bus and trying to sleep. just sleep. because you must be fresh, sober and clean in evenings. after live you have a little time to discharge your stage excitement. then you have a bit time to have fun. but its not any luxury or dream. artistically this film was zero. stupid characters and idiotic dialogs. the ending of movie was funny -- main character left heavy metal band and formed a grunge band! yeah, what a moral. real 90s.

no emotion. bad music (and i am a reformed eighties metal guy, so i would be vulnerable to some good stuff.) everything is half done. the brother is a parody, there is nothing to hold us in except to see what horror from the eighties they'll pull up next. the tour manager tries to bring a humanity to the thing but isn't given enough time. wahlberg is okay and aniston is slumming. we know she didn't need the money. is this the only role she could fit into her summer break? surely she must slap her forehead every time it pops up on vh1--which is only slightly less often than ozzy does. it barely qualifies as a tv movie. it's just hard to believe that it was actually released theatrically.

here is another great film critics will love. the problem is that it is not a very good movie.the films premise is simple. nine convicts escape a prison after the tenth one goes crazy and tells them where the treasure is.the first half has a lot of slapstick some of it very broad while the second half is a character driven descent into fantasy and melancholy.the two halves simply don't mix. individual scenes do work very well (the guys crashing a friends house who has a new filipino bride is hilarious while a later scene with the big guy working in the restaurant tugs at the heartstrings.) they simply don't mesh with each other.the movie as well is missing entire set-ups. one scene shows the guys desperately looking for change under a deserted vending machine to buy a snack. the very next scene has the whole crew in drag sitting down in a restaurant. where did they get the dresses and wigs? (the crew includes both the big guy and a midget) how did they get all the clothes and money to buy the meal? and most puzzling is why are they in drag? they are clearly guys in drag and lets face it is there anything more memorable to witnesses than a big guy and a dwarf eating a meal dressed as women? i mention the big guy and the dwarf because besides the old guy everyone else seems to blend into each other. (in fact they wear matching white jumpsuits throughout most of the movie) the movie has very little character development in the first half and as a result the second half really lacks an emotional punch. as we are often trying to figure out who is who in their individual payoff scenes.speaking of a drag the second half has all those wonderful sweeping camera shots and big emotional moments and great symbolism that makes a great film. it is also excruciatingly slow which makes for a boring movie.9 souls is a big disappointment, the reviews gush about a great film and it's in there somewhere, good luck finding it yourself.

the idea of nine stupid prisoners escaping and going on a road trip sounds pretty good for a movie. especially because it's meant to be funny and i guess heart-warming in some weird way. the problem is, the movie was very rarely funny and often just seemed pointless and needlessly gross. it was as if jokes or interesting scenes were being set up again and again but no one bothered finishing any of them--there was just no payoff. also, the movie was just brainless and had the crooks meandering across japan even though they left so many crime victims alive that it's impossible to believe they wouldn't have been caught almost immediately--especially since they continued to keep using the same stolen camper for days on end. and as far as being gross goes, i just didn't need to see scene after scene after scene of guys peeing along the side of the road. plus, believe it or not, there is a scene where four of the guys are out raping sheep!all in all, i really hated this movie. and it's a shame, as i almost always love japanese films--just not poorly made and uninteresting ones like this one.

now that's it's 2008, who really has a care in the world about a guy like db sweeney, even back then he wasn't a big deal.two tickets to paradise is an outlined story that's well and true where three friends hit the road under each of their personal circumstances. again, a proved plot. the problem with this film, other than it's 'so bad it's compelling' title, is the script.cliché after cliché three guys do the same things you've seen in every other road movie... and blow up vanna white's house.john c. mcginley's acting job is superb, especially compared to that of the late db sweeney's. (his career is dead, hence the late. though i hear he's moving to tv, good for him). also, john c likely has the least awful character in the film.the score is so generic it actually feels like you're watching a third rate film from 1993, or jeff anderson's movie now you know (also set me back a few years, but at least that was more entertaining.) i mean, yah, i guess i enjoyed parts of it. but, the nerdy guy is annoying, db tries to be this cool failed guitar player (with some rough influences, like some of the worst of classic rock) who has some strange relationship with a stripper, and john c is a gambler who's wife and kid leave him after the death of his father as well as a visit from one of his bookie's henchmen.i keep thinking up ways to make this movie better. but i think burning the script would have been a healthy start.but, as i've hinted this whole time, it's not the worst movie ever. and any chance i have to see mcginley in a starring role, i'll take it. hopefully he starts getting some better projects.

critics love this movie. i personally found it senseless and tasteless. this is the millionth time i've fallen into the "critics love it" trap and came out wishing someone would throw boiling hot water on my testicles because it was less painful than watching the movie. there are many scenes that are completely unnecessary. a warning to animal lovers: don't see this movie if you don't want to see sheep killed and molested.if you want to see a good asian film, see afrika. if you want to see a film about escaped convicts, see the gene wilder/richard pryor classic stir crazy. avoid 9 souls like the plague.

starring: james belushi; peter dinklage; alex neuberger and jason lee underdog is a true hero's tale. here is the story of shoeshine, a regular, playful little beagle. when he is dog napped by a megalomaniac midget hell-bent on destruction, something freaky happens.our quirky little neighborhood pooch gains extraordinary powers. he can run as fast a cheetah; fly as fast a superhero and has the power of thunder. he is no longer shoeshine; he is underdog  the best crime-fighter in the animal kingdom. the city cannot sleep until underdog rids it of the evil midget dr. simon barsinister and his cronies.if you fancy some really light-hearted entertainment with all the clichés of superhero action flicks, then this one is for you. as for quality entertainment, this one is strictly for the juniors. those of you hoping to enjoy the comedy of the fast-fading star -james belushi - a word of caution: this is not one of his finer works.

jason lee does well to give this doggy movie fleeting promise, but it's not enough to distinguish it from any other bland family comedythis live-action, cg-enhanced adventure sees a shamed police dog (jason lee) transformed into a super-dog via an accident in the lab of scheming scientist dr. simon barsinister (peter dinklage). underdog sets about saving the city while attempting to keep his identity secret - a challenge given that he can both talk and fly.the odd gag raises a smile, but underdog's human sidekicks (james belushi and alex neuberger as father and son) are as dull as the predictable storyline. one for kids too young to have seen superman. or spider-man. or even shaggy dog

i didn't like underdog!i mean it was really unnecessary and needed a big face lift and then it would have been maybe passable but for the main part i didn't like it.this wasn't like any other kid movie its one of those movies that wanted parents(who grew up watching the cartoon)to come with there kids to come see this,i am neither of them so the film didn't appeal to me in the slightest.i had some problems with it like i don't think jason lee was the right voice for underdog it made it him sound sloppy and really unintelligent.then it was really predictable which makes you feel tired and mad.the humor was really what made me mad it was just to unfunny and somewhat pathetic.the one thing that bothered me the most thought was how almost everything out of underdog's mouth was sarcastic or rude.the acting was passable but needed a little improvement.if you have kids they might enjoy it, but if your not a kid by all means see it you might like it unlike me. 3.4 stars out of 10

story of the creation of underdog and adventures battling simon bar sinister in a live action format. first we have showshine picked up off the street and brought to a science experiment lab where simon bar sinister works. he fights back when sinister tries to inject him with a chemical and accident occurs, he gets superpowers and the lab blows up wounding sinister. on the street shoeshine runs afoul of riff raff, another dog and gets picked up by jim belushi who was a guard at the lab. belushi's son discovers that shoeshine has all these powers and eventually shoeshine becomes underdog, who will once again battle sinister.once you decided that under dog was going to be a real dog you've sort of limited yourself as to whether the film was going to work or not. for me the film half works and half doesn't. the part that doesn't is all of the stuff where you see shoeshine, the dog, as a dog with his master. some of the repartee is funny, but it just drags on and on as we get introduced to sweet polly and her mistress and we go through all the typical lets see what you can do stuff. its a deadly 20 or 25 minutes and effectively kills the film. its painfully dull and feels like it takes forever to get through it, which considering the film is say 75 minutes sans credits, is something you don't want to do.the parts that are good are anything with simon bar sinister (peter dinklage is a blast) and anything where underdog goes into action. some how somewhere they managed to find a way to be both twistedly true to the spirit of the cartoon and to update it. of course i could be wrong since the middle section is so dull, but i think not, since i do look forward to catching the end of this again on cable.as a whole its probably as awful as some people have said, but if you can wait for cable where you can stumble on the good parts, this is an okay cartoon to film adaption. (but wait for cable-really)

you have to acknowledge cimino's contribution to cinema. he gave us both the most over-rated film in history (the deer hunter) and the worst film in history (heaven's gate). and before you start with the 'it's bad but not the worst ever' let me explain. for 20+ years i listened to the critics and avoided "heaven's gate"-actually this was not hard because you are hardly bombarded with opportunities to view this film. then a few days after seeing the 'final cut: the making and unmaking of heaven's gate' documentary i stumbled on a used $9.99 dvd of the long version. my advice after 229 minutes is to seek out the most negative review ever written about this film (you will find a wide selection), and imagine that the reviewer is cimino's devoted mother and that she is doing everything she can to put a positive slant on her dear son's movie. then you will have an idea of just how big a mess cimino made.while pretty much everything is wrong with this film, what ultimately tips the scale to make it the worse ever (and a classic 'less than zero' example) is its shameless distortion of history. although the cattlemen's association did send a group of regulators/gunmen to johnson county and did have a list of targeted names, the actual facts of an interesting historical event are hopelessly exaggerated. on the morning of april 9, 1892, nick ray and nate champion were besieged and eventually killed by an army of about 50 cattlemen and texas hired guns who had come to johnson county to clean out "rustlers." the citizens of the county then besieged the regulators who finally were arrested (or rescued) by the army. women did not actively participate in the fighting and aside from ray and champion there were minimal casualties. after all, these were sieges not assaults-and there were not wagons of immigrants riding in circles around the encampment of regulations (early westerns to the contrary this was a film making device and not an actual tactic of the indians). and weeks prior to the arrival of the regulators a number of johnson county residents were hanged without trial including jim averell, the keeper of a modest road ranch, and his wife ella watson (who cimino resurrects as his two leads and he even shows averell living to a ripe old age). there is no movie-making sin greater than fictionalizing history, if you are going to play fast and loose with historical facts, then change the names and locations to protect the unsuspecting audience members who might go away from a film believing what they saw actually happened. fortunately so few people saw this film that the damage was minimal. perhaps it is harsh to blame cimino for his distortion of history. he could probably escape blame anyway with an insanity defense-the film provides plenty of support. if cimino was insane during the production of heaven's gate it would explain a lot of things. but my vote goes to 'lack of directing talent' instead of insanity.there are some good things about heaven's gate. you can actually see on the screen where some of the huge budget went; expensive sets-beautiful epic camera shots-artful dance sequences. isabelle huppert (a strange casting choice that actually worked) gives an agreeable and likable performance although most of her scenes are extremely boring (that tends to happen when the director forgets to give the viewer any reason to care about the characters). the dialogue is generally solid if rather ordinary.but don't fall for the crap that this film experiments with storytelling by intermixing carefully crafted moments of character interaction with textured pageant-like explosions of communal action. this implies that there was a method to cimino madness. 'experiments' is another word for when a filmmaker gets so lost in his project that a coherent story is no longer possible. the simple fact is that there is no evidence cimino storyboarded a single scene or made any attempt at control or organization. what it looks like is that he just turned his dp loose to stage action and to get an endless selection of colorful shots-1.5 million feet of loosely staged scenes. then he tried (without success) to pare this down and fit everything together in post-production. the final battle scene is genuinely hilarious as babushka wearing townswomen (perhaps borrowed from a 'fiddler on the roof' touring company) throw countless sticks of dynamite at the regulators. unfortunately each explosive falls just short of the target and explodes harmlessly. after you see this happen 50-60 times you can relate to the woman (the one who looks like something out of 'the grapes of wrath') who puts a huge gun in her mouth and pulls the trigger. this is probably what cimino's mother did after writing that review.so believe what you have been hearing about this film since 1980. it is a sloppy, disconnected, poorly paced, and historically distorted mess. of value only as a 'how not to make a film' example for film historians and as a source of amusement to those knowledgeable about the actual history of the american west.

i watched this last nite with an open mind. sorry to say it is still bad. first, the movie is too noisey and you can't hear what people are saying. the accents are bad especially richard masur. what is the french chick doing in this film ??? miscasting at its worst. walken's makeup is strange. the harvard scene is useless and not needed. kristoferson's character is unlikeable and i wanted him to get killed and go away. meanwhile, the walken character gets killed too early and easily ( despite the makeup). the settlers are all stupid. get organized you bunch of hicks, people are coming to kill you !!!!! john hurts character provides some humor buts thats all.i have nothing good to say about this excessive piece of crap. the only good thing is it ruined the director's career and killed united artists.still crap after all these years.

i have just recently seen heaven's gate. after i watched this 3 hr 40 min epic western that's not a western, i read the book by steven bach. after considering all events and the movie itself, i still think this movie is a complete waste of time. i believe that when someone tells you to watch it, they are, in fact, trying to bore you to death. if for some reason you can enjoy this self indulgent over thought truely bad movie, i have to ask why. though this isn't a reason to hate it, it is historically way off. it pretends to be about a situation that happened in wyoming called the johnson county war. simply, the cattle barrons of the time wanted to kill all cattle thieves and claimed they were all immagrants. you find that you simply do not care about these people and hope they all get killed because at least then, something would happen. everybody in the movie talks about things that happen, and it is never shown. after you sit though this giant waste of time you wonder how someone could actually make a 4 hr epic in which nothing happens. oh and by the way the johnson county war was not a war, it never happened. the johnson county war, in fact, was called that because it almost happened, in actual fact, 2 people died. i can't warn you enough off this movie. however, if you're like me the, the idea of watching a movie that ruined careers and put united artists on the "for sale" lot, sounds like an interesting case to study, then by all means, watch this terrible, narsisistic, movie with no sub-text, and a lot of photography.(which is lovely sometimes)

the film, heaven's gate, was a good view, although still tedious at over 4 hours. but the film took great license - as usual with hollywood. james averill (chris christopherson), and "elle" were actually married in real life. their main contribution to the johnson county war, was to start it by being hanged. well, by starting it, i mean it came at the beginning, not the end. here's the real scenario: james averill and ellen watson were secretly married because one homestead could be given to each family. by filing as single individuals, they could get two homesteads. they chose homesites on crazy woman creek actually controlling the water above the land held by a powerful member of the cattleman's association. he offered to buy them out repeatedly, which they refused.although characterized in real life as the owner of a brothel (cattle kate), and a prostitute herself (and also in the film), there is no real evidence that was true. it is known that she bought many head of sick cattle, nursed them back to life, and was later accused by the cattleman's association of receiving the cattle in trade for "lewd acts'. in the end, she was accused of rustling - an act almost certainly untrue. so much for this part of the myth of the "american west", which is a gooble-de-gook of myths spanning a time period of about one hundred years.in real life, she and jim averill were surprised one day by several members of the cattleman's association, taken in hand, and promptly hanged. those perpetrating the injustice were never brought to trial. but that was the first link that led to the murder of nate champion, and the start of the johnson county war.quite different from the hollywood version which shows her shot at the end. other than that, i think the main problem with the film was the editor, who could have made the action a faster pace by more skillful editing.

the operative rule in the making of this film seems to have been "never make a 1 minute scene when you can make it a 10 minute scene." this was a principle set right from the start with an interminably long portrayal of the graduation of the harvard class of 1870. the point of that scene, i suppose, was to introduce some of the primary figures in the story and give a bit of their background - which is somewhat effective when comparing the idealism of the harvard graduation ceremony to the realism of life in johnson county, wyoming, but it just keeps going and going, and that sets the stage for a film that features repeated stretches of mind-numbing nothingness, made even worse by the fact that i found a significant amount of the dialogue to be almost incoherent. in the end, i couldn't even watch this in one sitting. i got through about half of it and had to set it aside for a couple of days before i could drag myself back to see how it turned out.my reaction to this movie in many ways is a shame, because there are positives here. the performances are generally of a high calibre, especially from kris kristofersson as averill, christopher walken as champion and isabelle huppert as ella. the basic story - interspersed as it is around that ever-present mind-numbing nothingness - is potentially interesting, focusing on the efforts of immigrants to establish themselves in johnson county and a local cattle company's efforts to stop them by killing a number of them in collaboration with the government and the military. there's also some absolutely breathtaking scenery shots. having said that, the whole thing could frankly have been done in half the time - and should have been. in the end, all those potential positives are washed out by - again - the mind-numbing nothingness that the movie seems to revolve around. seriously - 2/10.

the director spent a lot of time making the scenes look real right down to the historical photos and all the sounds of the old west bustle. too bad the producers and writer/director, michael cimino, spent zero time on any of the historical facts of what the johnson county war was really about. a lot of the war was over how public lands should be used for grazing. the cattlemen didn't want the poor sheep herders on the land to compete for forage on this cold, windswept plateau. the entire epic makes no mention of grazing sheep which was one of the most important reasons for the war.the worst scene is the battle between the peasants and the hired killers. the peasants are shown circling the gunmen like a bunch of indians would do in much earlier hollywood movies. the true fact is that johnson county sheriff william (red) angus, with a posse of 200 to 300 men, intercepted the gunmen and trapped them in a barn at the ta ranch. i doubt any women took part in the siege. ellen (ella also known as cattle kate) watson and her second husband, james averell, were hanged by a lynch mob about three years before the johnson county invasion. ella was never a prostitute. this was a canard spread by the wyoming stock growers association (wsga) in order to discredit her. the fact that the plot makes her out to be a brothel madam only serves the interests of the wsga.i object to the use of names of real people in a plot that is so obviously fiction. there is no fact in the events, time lines, or backgrounds of the characters. why michael cimino would use real names of people who were loosely connected with the johnson county war (and events leading up to it) is beyond me.the movie could have been much more interesting if it had dwelt on the political ramifications of the federal government intervention in a state government's affairs and what happened after the wsga gunmen were saved by the calvary. some effort was made to prosecute the cattlemen who were responsible by the johnson county attorney. but since johnson county could not afford the court costs and the governor of wyoming, amos w. barber, backed the wsga, the charges were eventually dropped.overall i think the movie was just an excuse to show isabelle huppert naked for much of the three and 3/4 hours of running time on the dvd version.

now infamous western that was (at its time) the biggest budgeted disaster in hollywood history. i was "lucky" enough to see the full 220 minute version at a theatre in 1990. it was truly staggering how bad the film was!they had a great cast, a story based on a true incident (a fight between foreigners and americans in the 1800s), magnificent scenery...so what went wrong? three words--director michael cimino. he was so full of himself after "the deer hunter" he went out and made this god awful western. he's not totally to blame. his previous film "the deer hunter" was considered a masterpiece and united artists gave him free reign to do anything. they let him all alone...and everything went wrong. the cost went barreling out of control and cimino insisted on redoing sequences again and again until they were perfect.first off, the sound is horrible. entire sequences go by and you can't make out a word the characters are saying. for instance, jeff bridges' character is introduced during a dance sequence, but i still have no idea who he was! the dialogue in his introductory scene is incomprehensible! that's the director's fault--he should have made sure the dialogue could be heard. some scenes are shot with so much dust flying around you can barely make out what's going on. the story line doesn't make a whole lot of sense and cimino took great liberties with the facts--in the real story only one person was killed--cimino turns it into a massacre. there is some admittedly beautiful sequences here totally destroyed by lack of story and incomprehensible dialogue. also the bad sound was not the fault of the theatre--all the prints sound that way.this garbage effectively closed down united artists and was the end of cimino's career. a textbook example of a director so full of himself he doesn't realize what he's doing. jeff bridges has said this is the worst movie he ever did. this is from a guy who made "tron"! a definite must-miss.there is a pretty good book called "the final cut" which details the whole disaster. this gets a 1. i wish imdb had negative numbers--this deserves it!

this is the movie that, pretty much, sounded the death knell for the auteur in hollywood. at over 40 million bucks, heaven's gate is so poorly conceived and executed it would take a lifetime to break down every area of failure. what really galls me the most about it is that technically it's very bad, an unforgivable sin for the money that went into it. john hurt's commencement speech at harvard is inaudible, as is a conversation between kris kristofferson and richard masur at the train station. some people seem to think cimino intended this as a "style". he didn't. it's just bad sound recording. the characters are not particularly well-drawn, except for the four or five leads; in the climactic battle scene, it's difficult to tell who's the bad guys and who's the good guys. even on that level, it's impossible to enjoy the movie. the casting of isabelle huppert as the town madam is a joke, her french accent renders the whole character a fraud. the acting is generally stiff, without any range or depth of feeling; even christopher walken is bad. john hurt's character is the only one with any swagger or vitality (although hurt, in his 40s, playing a fresh-faced harvard grad with bags under his eyes is patently ridiculous).  i guess to say that it's overlong is overkill. the roller-skating sequence could have been easily cut, the cockfight scene is rapidly becoming a movie cliche, and the final scene on board the ocean liner is right out the twilight zone. having rod serling appear before the camera at the end to explain what we just watched would have been the perfect finale. actually, those scenes in and of themselves are not bad, but cimino has not earned the right to include them, because what he's given us as the "meat" of the picture is so incompetently bad. the editing is poor, especially in the grand battle climax. at one point, the same explosion with the same wagon wheel flying from the blast is used three different times. i wish could i say something- anything- nice about this movie: a great scene, a great performance, even one memorable line of dialogue, but i can't. it is all just one big unholy mess. about the only thing i did like was the cinematography and the montana locations, which are stunning. even cimino couldn't screw that up. this is a long, boring, bad movie by all standards. and the people who say that it gets bashed only because of the cost overruns are just kidding themselves. 1/2 * out of 4

let's see. what annoyed me most? the extra long dance scene in the beginning watching people twirling around so much i got dizzy... without even showing where the music was coming from... all part of a college graduation that had nothing to do with the rest of the film. or perhaps it was the fact that each scene lasted about fifteen minutes longer than they had to. what a drag this film is. and the most annoying aspect is the bad guys are so bad, so obviously horrible that it seems as if the director were making this film for second graders. "these people are bad... these people are good". whenever a movie has its agenda-heart on its sleeve i am beside myself. there's a scene in a rollerskating rink that seems totally out of place. long drawn-out love scenes with the main character and a russian prostitute that seems more like a rock star and his sexy groupie. john hurt's character, who is part of the overlong beginning scene, drinks and disagrees with the overdone villains. his death scene could very well be the stupidest in history. and i hear everyone, even the haters of this film, talk about how gorgeous the cinematography is. i think it looks washed-out. watch "days of heaven" if you want to see gorgeous backyards. this movie is even worse than the anti- hype. it's pointless. the epilogue, showing the main character in a yacht, was almost as dumb as the prologue. the battle scenes are tedious and dizzying. this movie is really bad. avoid it unless you love bad movies, because this is the king of them.

the recent death of stephen bach, one of the producers of heaven's gate, has raised the specter of at least a partial resurrection of the reputation of the cursed film. moreover the original release, the "long version" was recently shown on tcm exposing the film, in ail probability, to its largest audience ever. i saw the film when it first came out at a packed screening in a 3rd avenue cinema across the street from bloomingdales. i think it was released on a friday and withdrawn on the following wednesday. maybe that wasn't a fair release but it was and is a terrible film. seeing the full-length version recently confirmed that judgment and with some thirty years more experience watching and writing about films i am better able to articulate why.first there is the dreaded phrase "mise-en-scene" whose definition is at the same time so simple yet so amorphous that it puzzles even after being defined. basically it's everything that happens in front of a camera. for example, a crowd extra will be given a piece of action, say just walking by on the sidewalk and a spot to start from. when the assistant director yells action the extra will go through their action. if there's another take the extra will return to the start spot and go again on "action". all of the extras do this. then say a cab drives up to the sidewalk and the star gets out and embraces another principal while all the while the crowd extras are doing their thing. this is mise-en-scene. in the theatre they call it blocking but cinema is far more multi-dimensional.the importance of defining mise-en-scene is because when the french critics developed their theory of the auteur the opposite of an auteur was a métier-en-scene, even more derogatorily referred to as a "traffic cop". an auteur was intimately involved in the meaning of a film and through the director's body of work a theme or themes discerned. the metier-en-scene was basically a company man rendering in film what had been handed to him on paper. it is the difference between say john ford and sam wood.the second point is how the director, michael cimino, got into the position of directing films. cimino first gained prominence directing the first million-dollar tv commercial. this depicted a chevrolet floating down the grand canal in venice. this commercial never appears on any lists of greatest tv commercials of all time and is notable solely because of how expensive it was and how utterly exaggerated it was. the effect is like that of a three year old girl brought out to entertain company who gets her biggest response when she flings her dress over her head. cute for a three year old, embarrassing for a thirty year old. so cimino was praised early on for spending a huge amount of money for some over-the-top image and so he learned.his first film, thunderbolt and lightfoot (1974) has a scene where clint eastwood and jeff bridges are passengers in a lunatic's car that drives back and forth, back and forth, until it drives off the road and the driver opens the trunk full of rabbits which he proceeds to shoot one by one. i had the feeling that if the producer, eastwood, hadn't stepped in, that the scene would have lasted until every rabbit had been killed.which brings us to heaven's gate. i guess if one watches the film on a dvd in snatches like a mini-series it can be impressive. this is because scenes are directed with such a dense mise-en-scene that each scene is like an encyclopedia it's just plain exhausting to sit through nearly four hours of this. its like sex, at some point it just becomes a whipping. there is the opening 40 minutes, which takes place at harvard. brilliantly photographed at oxford, it is something of a non-sequitur. i personally favor the artistic way of unfolding a story as opposed to the more commercial _"now i'm gonna tell you what i'm gonna tell you" of most films. however the whole preface adds up to only one line- kris kristofferson and john hurt went to harvard together. now twenty years later all of that time, money and effort, not to mention all of the audiences' attention and energy just to deliver this almost useless piece of information.then there's the scene in the street between kristofferson and masur which just goes on and on with a populated city of background extras and horse drawn vehicles in the background in continuous motion to deliver a tiny bit of expositional information. it's just so exhausting. there is just one scene after another like this. it's like trying to eat a thirty- pound pizza. then there are these long conversations of inconsequential details and unintelligible, witless dialogue, which go on and on and are exhausting and boring. of course any single scene excerpted looks brilliant. overall it's a rich piece to spin praiseworthy articles about. seen in snatches with the possibility of fast-forwarding through the boring bits or turning it off if feeling mise-en-scene whipped, it's basically painless. but don't let anybody tell you it's a good film. when i saw it in 1980 there was a guy sitting in front of me who commented on the scene where kris kristofferson is on his horse and he turns one way and then the other and does this about six times. "that's symbolic," he said, "of he doesn't know which way to go." that is basically, at its kernel, the basis of every pro- heaven's gate critique.watch it, if you must, but be forewarned, this is not a film whose time has come, this is a stinker which will smell for all time. heaven's gate is historically inaccurate in the extreme. i recommend the book banditti of the plains by asa mercer on the johnson county war.

**warning - this review may contain spoilers ** the idea behind the character of danny (jet li) is a good one - young boy is taken by hoodlum and raised to behave like a vicious pitbull, controlled mainly by whether his collar is on or off his neck.however, the writer did not know how to deliver this idea within the constraints of believability.he has danny meeting a blind pianist, sam (morgan freeman), who has to be the most trusting fool a man ever was - along with his nit-wit, endlessly babbling, rather unattractive step-daughter, victoria (kerry condon). i was stunned, by the way, when i learned victoria was supposed to be 18 - she looked 25 or 30 to me.amazingly there is no romance between danny and victoria.when danny turns up again, wounded, what does sam do but take him straight home. danny is out for 2 days, but do these nit-wits take him to a hospital? nooooo. i don't know if they even called in a doctor.now danny is obviously not a mentally stable person, this is apparent from the get-go, yet sam takes him into his home, where both he and his step-daughter could have been seriously harmed or even killed by this rather strange, young man.why morgan freeman took this insipid role in this asinine film i can't even begin to guess. surely mr. freeman is not that desperate for a paycheck.then we have bob hoskins as bart, the gangster who "owns" danny - now you talk about a son of a gun that's hard to kill. the car bart is in gets riddled with bullets that would have rivaled bonnie and clyde's demise. we think he's dead, but no.then we have another car accident - and yet again, ol' bart escapes unscathed.in addition to that, we also have danny fighting half a dozen tough guys at a time, plus a scene where danny has decided he doesn't want to fight any more. i don't care how much a person doesn't want to fight, when it is down to the wire of you fight or you die, i think anyone would fight.as i said in the subject heading - this film is about 40 miles outside the boundary of reality as we have come to know it. it's not just a case of suspending belief - it's completely beyond that.furthermore i never did understand why danny's mother who turns out to be a nice lady, rather than the prostitute bart claimed she is, became mixed up with bart and his gang and got shot. maybe that was my fault, i got distracted right about the time that scene came on--but it seemed highly unlikely she and bart would have ever crossed paths.4 stars out of 10 - and that's being generous.

apart from the beautiful imagery thanks to new zealand cinematographer alun bollinger, this film is not worth seeing.the storyline is so fragmented and lost that it's hard to know what is going on at any given time, and just when you think you're following then the direction changes again, like a lost bi-polar puppy dog.the musical score is awful, relying too heavily on extremely emotive pieces that try to force the audience into feeling a certain way, as if the instruments were acting as an emotions queue sheet  'feel sad here'; 'feel shocked here'; 'feel scared here'. on top of that, the repetitive samples used over and over again leave the audience on the verge of laughter.gone are the days of silent film, where musical instruments were the sole portrayal of voice  but you wouldn't think so while watching river queen.the voice-over was so over-utilised that one has to wonder if this film really even needed any accompanying imagery. it could have easily been a radio play although even then it would be hard to follow the story.and the stolen ideas from jane campion's the piano are too obvious to overlook. not only are the beach and forest shots almost identical to those in the piano  perhaps some of this comes down to alun bollinger's camera work on the latter  but the voice-over feeling and levels too are strikingly close. and who could forget when holly hunter's character has her wings clipped, in the form of her index finger being cut off by sam neill. does it remind you of when wiremu has his 'trigger finger' amputated, and surprisingly too with an axe? i thought so.all in all i cannot recommend this film for viewing, unless you wear some ear-muffs and just go with the scenery in mind.

river queen's sound recordist should have been fired, in this day and age there is no excuse for poor recording on the set. mumbling voices was the end result, and the cinematography was average to fair at best. the story had potential and i feel sorry for the overseas actors who must have known they were on a turkey shoot while they were filming. its obvious that the movie was suffering from el cheapo budget syndrome, and the scene where temuera is procreating inside the house while a battle rages outside is just too stupid for words. i noticed a few shortcuts taken on the maori protocol side of things, but this was probably due to movie length time restraints etc. all in all i wasn't impressed with this movie, the whanganui river has many beautiful spots but this movie gives us a cold, drab and claustrophobic image, with none of the beauty. the movie needed more sunshine and better camera angles, less on screen confusion, better sound recording, and more thought needed to be put into what the movie goers would be seeing on the big screen. hats off to all involved though for completing what must have been a very difficult shoo. i have the utmost appreciation for anyone who can make a feature film, sadly i did not enjoy this one.

wow, i just got one watching this.how crappy post production is on this movie.i kid you not, i literally could've done a better job myself.all of post production is flawed, all of it. whoever cut this film should be banned from the film industry.that aside, the script was a trainwreck. absolute rubish.not to mention jack bauer and his patchy the pirate in spongebob accent. wtf is his character doing there? but to me, the biggest flaw of all was character development, intereaction, dynamics, dialogue. wow. i cant believe how bad it was.i give this movie a 2 out of 10. 1 for samantha, who is a great actress, too bad the production made everyone look like amateurs out there.the other 1 goes to cinematography, which was indeed good.other then that my friend, this is one bad movie.i don't even feel like making an elaborate post on this, it was just horrible production. poor actors, didn't know what they were getting into...

i watched the 219 minute version and have to say that dollar-for-dollar, it it probably one of the worst films ever. now i am not saying it's the worst film ever--but if you look at a ratio of cost over how much an average person would enjoy it, this is a very, very bad film.i would say that the single biggest factor making this a bad film is the writer/director, michael cimino. rarely can so much blame be placed on a single person. had he not been so self-indulgent, a film just as bad could have easily been made at about 90 minutes--saving the studio millions! the film begins with a completely unnecessary prologue that's supposed to be set at harvard. the scene is huge but completely without context. you have no idea exactly what is occurring nor do you know why the students (in particular, john hurt) are behaving so boorishly. i find it very hard to imagine a commencement going like this in 1870--and it looks a lot more like 1970. this is a half hour where you have no idea what is happening, who the characters are or their motivations. the next scene is 20 years later. inexplicably, the two harvard grads (hurt and kris kristofferson) are in wyoming. so, they went to the best school in america and now one is only a law man in the middle of no where and the other is....well, what is john hurt in the film?!?! he just appears here and there and seems to be either a jerk (the prologue) or a pathetic and pointless drunk who hangs out with murderers--even though he is apparently against them!? his entire character made no sense. they never explained why he was a brit living in the middle of nowhere (it was impossible to hide his accent), why he bothered to come along with the hired army if he was so against their wicked plan nor why he would risk his life for a cause he didn't believe in at all. as for kristofferson, his excellent acting and better defined character made his character more believable, though having him move to wyoming and risk his life for a prostitute made no sense at all.this brings up the worst aspect of heaven's gate. while the scenes are way too long and needed trimming, the worst part of the film is that the characters were like cardboard. john hurt (a wonderful actor with nothing to do in the film), jeff bridges and many other big names are there but you have no idea why. in fact, other than kristofferson, isabelle huppert (as a hooker with a heart of gold--quite the cliché) and perhaps christopher walken, everyone is completely one-dimensional. it's hard to imagine a movie this long where you don't know or understand the characters. much of the film also seems anachronistic. who would have thought to have a giant roller rink constructed in the middle of no where in 1890? i am sure that just getting the basic supplies in this region in the west would have been very, very difficult--and yet we are expected to believe that trains filled with roller skates and lumber arrived instead of food. maybe if they hadn't spent a bazillion dollars building and frequenting the roller rink, the farmers could have afforded to buy food and avoided this war over purloined cattle!!! and what's with the guy on roller skates with the fiddle? what did this have to do with a land war? the most obvious problem you are left with is that it's a film where very, very little actually happens until the big battle late in the film. there are lots of scenes of filth and flat nothingness. so much nothingness that by the time the battle occurs, many audience members would have left or are now so hostile to the film that it's inevitable that nothing could salvage the film.as for the final battle, it was done reasonably well but had problems. first, this minor skirmish on the prairie lasted longer than the d-day invasion!! second, while details of the actual events of the so-called "johnson county war" are a tad sketchy, we do know that the characters played by huppert and kristofferson never actually were there, as they'd both been hung before the battle. third, i can't believe that cimino actually killed animals throughout the film--especially during the final battle. while i am far from a bleeding heart about animal rights, his need to use animal guts and actually kill some of the horses is a low point in cinematic history. watching and knowing that some of the horses died to achieve cimino's "vision" for the film is very sad.finally, after the big battle, we have an epilogue. while it is blessedly short, it also seemed completely unnecessary and vague. we see kristofferson on a fancy yacht, so we can assume that he's finally putting some of that harvard education to work for himself. we also see a woman who appears to be one that kris looked at a couple times during the prologue. most importantly, nothing is said and you have no idea what the final outcome. i read up on it myself and found that the film often got the facts wrong.overall, to say the film is long and needed tons more editing was like saying wwii was a "minor tiff". well, i've certainly seen a lot worse, but if you factor in the cost of production, i truly think it might just be one of the worst films in history.finally, when a film has this much explicit nudity i warn parents. however, as no child could sit through this film (even with a promise of sex), the warning is not necessary.

this is by far one the most boring movies i've ever seen! and if you don't believe me go ahead and watch it for yourself.the movie starts of slow, the storyline makes no sense at all. people fighting doesn't make any sense. i could not make sense of what they were talking during the movie (in most cases i didn't even bother) it does nothing to keep you watching the movie, the only plus point would be the cinematography. new zealand looks awesome. everything else just plain sucks.the actors try their best to keep us awake, but unfortunately you will go to sleep instead.do us all a favor, even if this gets on "on demand", don't watch it!

for weeks i had been looking forward to seeing this movie only to find myself hugely disappointed after wards. in my opinion, the only good thing 'river queen' had going for it was the amazing scenery used as backgrounds. the story line was all over the place, samantha's character sarah was very difficult to understand and what on earth were all the many close ups of her face for? it brought absolutely nothing to the story-if there was one at all!a better actor for the part of boy could also have been selected, to me it sounded like he read his lines straight of the script while shooting his scenes.overall, a real shame as it could have been such a good movie.

wait... wait... wait... wait... wait... wait..... what!? this movie is terrible, absolutely terrible. 1. the only reason kiefer sutherland is on the cover is to sell it to kiefer fans, only to have their hearts broken. he kills one guy, gets shot, and dies before half the movie is over, not to mention he was only in the first 10 min and then disappeared until the point which he died...why put him on the cover if his character blows. 2. where are the epic battle scenes promised in the preview on the back cover? 3. it was way too confusing, i mean whats up with the girl? she had to narrate the movie to try to get our attention, she failed! 4. if kiefer dies in a movie..... it fails. now i am going to go watch 24..... this movie fails!

i was really looking forward to this movie but sadly it didn't live up to expectation.a good movie has the audience identifying/empathising/sympathising with the main actor. unfortunately this was very hard to do with samantha morton.the storyline seemed very disjointed and didn't flow as it should/could have done.keifer sutherland appeared to be little more than window dressing and made me wonder why he agreed to play what appeared to be a bit part. beautiful scenery and the acting of tem morrison and cliff curtis was about the only plus.maybe by being a kiwi i set the bar higher for locally made films. maybe the change of director/ supposedly hard to work with main actor has biased my opinion.maybe i'm just trying to make excuses for a movie which could have been great.a lot of maybes which still does not explain why this movie just lacked anything special.it could have been great, it wasn't.

a good example of reversed, politically correct racism where white men are presented as senseless brutes who're only there to be massacred and their aboriginal adversaries as noble heroes, superior both in their appearance and abilities. apart from making the story overally dull, this also prevents the neutral viewer to identify himself with one or the other side - it's just too simplifying. the repetitive score is incredibly annoying (as is the voice-over), the characters lack any depth and the viewer is soon lost between questions like "who is this character" and "what the hell is that supposed to mean". photography is wonderful, though, and on the whole there's a lot of atmosphere to it but nice shots of misty landscapes alone don't save this movie. the dvd box uses kiefer sutherland as an eye-catcher. in fact, his character could have been played by anyone else because it's basically just an empty shell (like most non-maori characters), and disappears anyway around halfway the film. but if you are eager to see jack bauer in a kilt, that's your kind of movie...

this was one of the dullest movies i have seen in some time. i'm in my late 40s, and watched it with my son-in-law (early 20s) and son (17). the scenery was beautiful, but the story was a bust. we watched about an hour of it and turned it off. i spent more time on my iphone during the hour that we watched it than i spent actually watching the movie. i gave it a 3 because i enjoyed the scenery and cinematography; otherwise i would have given it a 1. i'm sure there are people who are really into the "art" of it all who will find my review appalling but we're all entitled to our own opinions, right? i couldn't figure out if this was supposed to be a "chick flick" where the focus was on the mother, or if it was supposed to be a movie for guys, with the focus on battle and adventure. in my opinion, it didn't succeed in either.

with an interesting premise (in the conflicts between europeans and indigenous peoples sometimes the battle lines were not so clear), this should have been a good film. but the story is sabotaged by the director's overriding infatuation with his own cleverness twinned with a very poor script.yes, the natural setting is beautiful and, yes, the movie is authentic to its 19th century historical setting. but the filmmaker keeps gilding the lily over and over again, adding layer upon layer of over-the-top musical accompaniment, not to mention a completely unnecessary voice-over, to the soundtrack, that ultimately overwhelm the viewer and, by calling attention to themselves, take away from the story.to me, it was clear the director, with his microscopic closeups and the endless recurrence of the musical motif of "danny boy" (of all things!) was trying to make a new zealand version of an epic sergio leone film, something on the order of once upon a time in the west. but given the earnestness of the story (most of leone's westerns were tongue-in-cheek), not to mention that it's no longer 1968, he succeeds in making a parody of one.too bad.

the nest is really just another 'nature run amock' horror flick that fails because of the low budget. the acting is ok, and the setting is great, but somehow the whole film just seemed a bit dull to me. the gore effects are not the best i've seen but are fun in a cheesy sort of way. the roaches themselves are just regular cockroaches that bite people. the nest reminded me of a much better film called slugs. if you liked the nest then slugs is a must-see as it's ten times better. also worth noting is that lisa langlois who plays elizabeth was in another 'nature run amock' type film called deadly eyes (aka the rats), which is about killer rats as you may have guessed. if you enjoy these types of horror films then you may want to give this a watch, but you'd be far better off seeing slugs which is far more interesting and gory.

worst movie ever!! its not clever or funny or thought provoking. 84 minutes of bad actors doing their best with an awful script.acting was so bad that you can see the dead people breathing.maybe the writer/director combination believed they were quentin tarantino or something (you know make a movie about nothing still cool) but failed miserably.i hope the writer never makes another movie ever!! not everyone is born a writer, sometimes we need to count our losses and go back to being a bathroom attendant or whatever.please don't watch this movie, even on mute with the stereo going its still a painful 84 mins.

honestly, people who gave this movie a ten would have given 100 for pulp fiction. this is the level that we are dealing with here.the movie isn't bad but no way is it like "omg, the best movie since pulp fiction!". some people have incredibly low expectations for movies, even those of indie variety. personally, i found my interest in the movie waned after the half-hour mark. the plot defies logic and belief. you have got to hear the part about why the wife did what she did in order "to save her husband". yeah, right. i guarantee that you would walk out of the theatre thinking, "hmm, now that doesn't make sense at all." this is one movie in which you really need to suspend all logic and belief.those who said that the music score is good were probably listening to their mp3 players. it absolutely killed the movie in some parts.in conclusion, watch the movie only if you have nothing particular important to do. i give this a three because there is one long sex sequence in the motel which is decent.

i should've realised it was a sign of things to come when the trailer for this film bored me.having watched several "indie" films on the strength of the reviews on here, and subsequently finding that my view is completely opposite to those other reviewers, i began wondering if it's possible i am watching completely different films from these people, or are they perhaps friends/family etc of the film makers trying to 'big up' their work? hmmm.are you interested in seeing an amateur's homage to pulp fiction and 11:14, except done with worse actors, a silly score (undermines various scenes) and unbelievable jumps in logic? if not, then skip this film.here is my open letter to two of the players in this film.alfonso morgan, please, please, please, stop trying to 'be' samuel l jackon a la pulp fiction. no-one can do what he does as well as he does.director, please come up with something original. it does you a disservice to churn out this stuff pretending to be quentin tarantino.simply dire, and i really cannot see how anyone could say this is a good film. it is a disgrace that people have somehow managed to put a score of 8.5 on this, the same as films like pulp fiction or goodfellas. it is no-where near these movies; a 4 or 5 would be a more reasonable average rating, i give it a 3.

this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. thank god i saw it for free. i would have hated to waste my money on it.first off, there isn't a character in the movie that is in any way likable. michael caine comes close, but even he is pretty flawed. the rest of the "commandos" are made up of disgusting ex-cons. there are the two gay arabs, and three guys who try to rape a red cross nurse, and the "leader" who has no trouble sending his men off to get killed so he can escape.the "mission" is anything from suspenseful. they are to blow up a fuel dump. sounds exciting, right? well, the footage follows them through endless sandstorms and fixing flat tires. yes, you read that right. the "suspense" is whether they will run out of spare tires. we actually watch them change something like 12 flats on the way. that's how incredibly exciting this movie is.they get to the fuel dump to find that it is a decoy. so, nothing to blow up. and at this time, for some very convoluted reason, the british army decides that they don't need these guys anymore, and radios their whereabouts to the germans to kill them.so, now at least we'll have an exciting race to freedom? nope, instead, they decide to blow up a different fuel dump, to create a diversion. but, when they get into the place, they set off a trip wire, and the germans come to get them -- calling out their names over a loudspeaker.really weird. if the germans knew where they were and where they were going, why did they let them get all the way into the dump before springing the "trap?" instead, they wait until they get into the fuel depot, and set all of their charges. yeah. right. that would happen.so, they blow the dump, the leader sells out all of his men -- except for michael caine, since he's been offered $2000 to bring him back alive.ok... so, the men are all betrayed and killed, and michael caine and nigel davenport survive. the british troops come in with tanks, and they decide to go get rescued. since they are wearing german uniforms (they wore them to blow up the dump) they tie a white flag around a stick and walk out into the road.some british guy walks up behinds them and machine guns them to death. credits roll.yep. the two "heroes" of the movie die due to a random act of violence.it's almost like the movie suddenly ran out of budget and decided: "that's a wrap. kill them off and we'll go home." i wasted 2 hours of my life watching this tired, unimaginative and totally unrealistic movie that ended with a gracefulness of a bomb.

it's great to hear the 3 or so comments, that point out what 'footballers wives' signifies for women. the title alone, washes away any supposed equality women have in the media industry or society, reducing them to two dimensional cartoon caricatures of how men think women should behave . it is a post modern moronic farce. it might as well be called, 'footballers wifey who stays at home and knows her place'.on one hand, it could actually be some sort of parody on the u.k.'s, gutter trash press representation of celebrities and the role they have in maintaining a patriarchal society. so women can undermine stereotypes by acting like those stereotypes and own the image that has been created for them by mens desire. nah, that would be to ironic and clever. i also sound like i should be praising it.zoe lucker is simply too camp and over the top to be taken seriously. just like an even cheaper cruella de ville. she just needs some maniacal, condescending, yet at the same time, self appraising laugh to show off her true acting range. oh she does? right. anyway, it just about sums up whom this is aimed at. either 'clever clever' journo's, who think its an up-roaring send-up of vaudevillian proportions, or people who think its 'real'. "finest actors"? omg!! stop watching this afterbirth of a pantomime and get a life.its utterly sexist and is of such low quality, that maybe those who enjoy it think they are "in" on the "joke". do the actors really care or understand what they are communicating? its so demeaning to women and men. they are not all self centred, selfish, football loving materialistic jerks, who think women are nothing but another trophy to be put on display for the public. it's so humiliating. i am sure ms lucker would easily stand up to them in her "real" life, and twist them round her finger as so easily done in 'footballers wives' .but of course, its doesn't really matter. i mean its only a t.v. programme after all. so please let it stay axed. it's dreadful and will only be looked back on in the same disbelief that 'prisoner cell block h' was so fondly remembered for.how did it come to exist? it sure ain't subtle or complex. it could only come from the same mind set who read fhm magazine, and think its "alright" to look at soft-porn, and "do" as many women who bow to their "will" and chant patriotic and racist comments whenever "their" football team losses/wins. it's totally crass.

what was the aim here...i started to have a look at it but then i realized that it had no aim...poor acting...no action and no story..i ended up listening to it while i was surfing the web reading about david beckham's $250 million dollar us soccer galaxy contract. do not rent this don't borrow this not worth a down load i've seen so many films that i could sense that this was going to be crap from the get go.war films should be accurate and if possible have some artistic merit and actually not feel like christian melodrama...this film pales in comparison to any that i've seen before.i must say that iam truly disappointed at this film..

after watch this movie i was surprised that someone had like it!!!! i think this is the worst comedy i ever seen....ever!!!! if you think you had already seen the worst comedy made wait for watch this crap!!!! not funny at all( ok one or two laugh maybe.......but you have to be really high), the acting is terrible and the story doesn't exist. even if you like snowboarding ( and i really do) you will hate this movie. ok, ok you can see some nice babes , some nice snowboarding tricks and some beautiful mountains but that's all!!! watch a porno set in the mountains instead because the acting and the story line might be better!!!!! sometimes in imdb i read bad review about some movie and at the end they are not so awful....but this one, believe me,is pure trash!!!! don't waste your time and money in this one.

i guess if you like snow boarding you may get some enjoyment from watching some nice scenery and some nice tricks. but that is all the film has to offer. the story line is non-existent, and any jokes that may have been in the film were not funny, even on a sympathy level. i also disliked the characters, the main actor (adam grimes)tried his best, and for a comedy like this that doesn't have to be much, but when surrounded by so many other bad actors he had no hope of making this film good. but i shouldn't be too harsh on them, for all i know they might have great skill, but with a script that i could have written in ten minutes, what ever skills they had were ran and hid for fear of appearing in this film. my advise is don't watch it, i wish i never did!

on this quagmire of mediocrity? you are so much better than this.simply put, frostbite is worthless. bad acting (and i use that term loosely), minimalist "plot," sophomoric humor, and lackluster snowboarding. there's not even a sufficient display of feminine pulchritude to spark the prurient interest of socially inept, but red-blooded, males.top gun had spectacular flight sequences to goggle at. days of thunder had heart-pounding racing action. even point break had skydiving scenes to its credit. frostbite has none of these. it's not worth your time, my time, traci lords' time, carmen nicole's time, nor the time of anyone involved with this destruction of celluloid that would have been perfectly usable on something worthwhile had it not been wasted on this fodder for the recycling center.the world will be a better place when we forget that frostbite ever existed.

the book was one of stephen king's best. the movie was pure rubbish. it was painful to remain in the theater until the ending, which wasn't even the same as the book. i guess that this is the result when you try to cram 10 pages of story into every minute. there is no good reason to watch this movie.

needful things was one of my favorite stephen king books. but this movie is one of the worst book to film adaptations i have ever seen they changed so many things around that it made me sick. even the concept of the book being deception, things not always what they appear reminder throughout the book was not shown in the movie. althogh it was enjoyable as many stephen king films are, but as many stephen king films this one did not follow the book and became a piece of hollywood trailer trash. 2/10

reading the book i felt once again drawn into castle rock (needful things being the final part of the rock trilogy), and the plot was a variant on the "demon comes to small redneck village" type story king likes to tell. the characters were all described in loving detail, and it made both a good psychological and gory horror. the film on the other hand is awful. gone are the character interactions and clever plot, and replaced by a story that tries to be exciting but misses by a mile. if you haven't read the book then you might enjoy this, else avoid at all costs, as with most films of king's books.

** may contain spoilers ** horrible. just horrible. i loved stephen king's novel, and this is just a horrible adaptation of it. they change the ending. they change the plot. they changed alan pangborne's character from a grieving husband to a happy fiancé. if you are a fan of stephen king's novel, stay away. even if you are not, stay away.the book was awesomely dark, even for steve king. an 11 year old kills himself in the novel. a middle school principal is found with child pornography in the novel. this is nowhere near as good as the novel.this movie is my least favorite film of all time. i hate this film with a vengeance.

after the lush, inspiring aerial shot in fast motion in the opening of the movie, this slipped into utter boredom and a one tone note right till the end.where to begin, well i'll start with the characters. i really enjoyed them in the book, here they all were types and one dimensional morons that either had "victim" or "asshole" written on their foreheads from the get go. how any one didn't see through the store owner lealand gaunt (in a hammy and out of place performance by sydrow)is beyond me.this film lacks in thrills, suspense, and in some sense yes, entertaining values. it stretches itself for far too long with not a lot of pay off. why introduce too many annoying should-die-quick type of characters and then forget about half of them half way through? in the book practically everyone that went into the store met a grisly fate. here, besides one of the only decent scenes that translated well from the novel (the fight between wilma and nettie), was a letdown and didn't have much balls. i'm sorry but after, one off screen death,a boring shoot off, and some bickering and then a couple explosions just didn't do it for me. the brutality and mean spiritedness from the book was sadly missing. the explosion of the church scene was so over the top and badly executed, all of sudden the entire city was in a brawl? it made no sense and characters that weren't introduced all the way through suddenly are, who are these people and why should i care?the story is all over the place and none of the scenes had momentum. i thought ed harris and bonnie bedeila were good actors in this, but the movie gives them not enough substance for me to give a damn. amanda plummer was credible but too pathetic to really be sympathetic (in the novel she was a sad and depressing character)here it was a too one note. j.t. walsh was entertaining, but the role was far from interesting or layered. too predictable. the soundtrack was too classy for the material it was supporting. it stood out like sore thumb. easy there buddy, easy. something a little less theatrical i'd assume would have worked.i will admit some of the gore it did manage to have was good enough i guess, the director seemed to hold back a lot of the times though. if your going to make a movie that reaches the 2 hr point be sure to have far more going on then this disaster of a adaption of on of kings better novels.i often found myself laughing at scenes that were suppose to be taken seriously (ed harris speech at the end, or the character hugh priest in general), and was bored and uninterested most of the other time. personally the director should have done so much more with this story, his approach is too tame and hides behind too much crisp cinematography to ever come off as a decent movie. the movie looks good, but not the look i think this story deserved. i mean, this dude helmed alaska,not a good sign. i'd rather just read the book, as you should too as if it is far more entertaining,layered character development, grisly violence and mayhem, a nasty sense of humour, and far more oomph. this is a butchered version, that has not much to offer. ** out of ****

took a very good book and completely butchered it. nothing was as it should have been. some of the best parts of the book were missing, including the major point of the whole book. simply the worst adaptation of a stephen king novel ever. this movie made the mini-series for it look good.

christophe lambert once said he was still making movies only to make good and easy money. when i see his latest releases, i can believe that.beowulf is, all in all, in the "good" part of the crap movies : there are some good thrill scenes, indeed. the actors themselves aren't too bad. but the plot is silly, the "mortal kombat"-like music has nothing to do here, the ending is really s****y...really, the only good thing about it is that me and my friends could laugh about how uninteresting it was. i even wish i wasted my money on something else.

"ordinary decent criminal" is sad because it is obviously trying to succeed and equally obviously hasn't a chance in hell of making it apparently owing to the absence of a clear sense of purpose. a abysmal failure at droll irish comedy with spacey as a thief who enjoys outsmarting the cops and his competition becoming a sort of folk hero in his own mind, this flick manages to be mildly amusing when it's trying to be funny, slightly more than boring when it's trying to be interesting, and forget sentimental or poignant or endearing though it takes shots at those qualities as well. "ordinary decent criminal" has a clumsy screenplay, naive direction, journeyman execution, thin story, poor casting, mediocre acting, and eventually becomes lost in itself and sinks into a mire of hopeless mediocrity. pass on this one. (d)

this film is really quite odd. clearly certain *events* portrayed identify the main protagonist as the dublin criminal known as "the general" but almost everything else is just wrong. we are not talking of a distortion of ancient history...but a complete distortion of irrefutable, documented facts. the question indeed is why? the garda are shown as latter day keystone cops, his gang as non-menacing, and the man himself as..well kevin spacey. almost pure fiction anyway, why bother to try to give a semblance of realism? having said all that, it is a poor exercise *any* way you want to look at it. not worth a second of anyone's time.

i was really looking forward to watching this film. it had all the ingredients of a great tongue in cheeker, but it just didn't come together at all. kevin spacey's accent was tolerable except that sometimes he forgot to use it and i would rather not have had to listen to linda fiorentino's pale attempt. she and helen baxendale were totally lacking in charm and personality, thankfully their screen kids had loads, so you could find at least some members of his 2 families endearing. you could have strained spaghetti with the plot and i'm sure that the script was written by some adolescent schoolboy in a high school english competition. that said, when i wasn't cringing, i was smirking so it wasn't a totally wasted 90 minutes. i did find the superimposing of kevin's face on the painting very clever and quite funny. maybe i'm being a bit harsh but i was expecting a bit of quality viewing and it just never came.

one of the worst excuses for an irish accents i've heard. from a truly great actor too. its a bad irish accent not to mention a dublin accent (which is completely different) anyway the film is loosely based around the story of ganglord martin cahill and its done much much much better with brendan gleeson in the title role in the general

"ordinary decent criminal" is sort of based on the exploits of martin cahill, already the subject of john boorman's 1998 film "the general". cahill had a rough upbringing in a slum area and graduated from petty crime to armed robbery with honours. he justified his criminal career by pointing out his poor background at every opportunity. this is a common excuse for criminals that conveniently overlooks the thousands of slum-dwellers who don't turn to robbing post offices and selling guns in order to make ends meet. cahill made fools of the police and local authorities, not to mention the ira, which earned him a sort of "folk hero" status as well as making him many enemies. however, he was basically an amoral, self-serving thief.my primary problem with "odc" is that the protagonist is made out to be a lovable irish rogue. kevin spacey does a good job portraying michael lynch with a blend of oily charm and quiet menace, but the character is too amoral and selfish to be seen as any sort of hero, even an anti-hero. the film is well shot and well acted by a fine cast, but what lets it down is the script. writer gerard stembridge can't make up his mind; is he writing an irish "lock stock" or a grittier treatment of martin cahill's thieving career? that's the problem when a writer bases his central character on a real person. it's also unfortunate that "odc" followed the cinema release of john boorman's "the general", which was a more accurate portrayal of martin cahill's story. cahill was a cunning thief who knew the value of good publicity, so it's not surprising that his exploits got the movie treatment.what is surprising is that a studio was prepared to take cahill's story and give it a happy hollywood-style ending. kevin spacey's charismatic-twinkly-bigamist-thief michael lynch gets to ride off into anonymity on his motorcycle in "odc". in the real world, martin cahill was executed by the ira, just to prove that no-one makes fools of an out-dated, sectarian and corrupt para-military organisation and gets away with it. the real cahill would never have walked away from his notoriety because it bolstered his "man of the people" self-image. having michael lynch give up everything to avoid death in "odc" is a cop-out ending to a weak and shallow movie.

after the general, a film that romanticized the life of dublin gangster the general to such heroic proportions that it made the average dublin person sick, along come kevin and his attempted portrayal of mr. lynch or martin cahill, aka the general, the acting is so bad that this crime drama becomes a comedy for the native dub, and a tragedy for the kevin spacey fan. in short, is the movie worth a look.... no, unless u like bad acting with hilarious 'proper irish accents, ah sure to be sure to be sure'. the story is ripped off from the commercially successful 'the general' which, despite is glorification of a well known dublin animal in martin cahill is still worth a look, on a domestic scale because it shows real working class dublin, and on an international scale because of he true irish acting and killer cast, including john voight. all in all, 'ordinary decent criminal' is anything but a decent film. avoid.

well,first of all, as many reviewers have pointed out - this is a rip off of the martin cahill story - first represented by the bbc and by the john boorman film "the general" - which is a great film and far, far superior to this one.speaking as a native british person, the supporting cast to kevin spacey was really good in terms of british and irish acting talent, especially peter mullan - but it was totally wasted. the characters were c**p! and as for kevin spacey - didn't come across as a loveable rogue but as nothing really substantial or significant.not a lot to redeem this film. the best bits are the gags and tricks nicked from the other films it rips off. compare notes on this film and "the general" - i'd be interested to see what others think.

kevin spacey is my favorite actor of all time, he is without a doubt on other's lists as well when it comes to great actors. he even pulled off a good irish accent in ordinary decent criminal as well. but kevin spacey, as a mafia leader? or even a burglar? i'm not so sure he could go that far. the movie to me just didn't make any sense and the some of the story just didn't feel solved to me.i know once again that imdb is going to make me write ten more lines. but i'm not so sure on what i could say about this movie because i am still trying to figure it out. silly, isn't it? but i'm pretty sure that more than a few of you imdb users have been in the same predicament as i am in right now where you just want to say a line or two about a movie, but now you have to do ten lines? wow, that should do it. :d 3/10

kevin spacey is without a doubt one of the best actors of the 90s. after his performances in the usual suspect, se7en and american beauty, you expect more and more from him. that is why ordinary decent criminal is a huge disappointment.michael lynch is the most artful criminal in dublin who is never in a bad mood. his next heist becomes an obsession when his partners start questioning michael's ability to plan everything perfectly, although this is the only thing he does when he isn't playing good father at home.i guess, it's partly my fault for not paying enough attention to the thousand plot details which sadly turn out to be the "essence" of the film. i gave the movie a chance by calling it a parody and.... well, parodies are always funny, no matter what they spoof or how they do it. so, it wasn't after all a complete parody on purpose. it's just a different con movie that desperately tries to be funny and fails.unlike some of his "colleagues", ordinary decent criminal depends too much on story development and logical continuity, forgetting what's the main reason, the viewer has picked this kind of movie - to be entertained. this is definitely not entertainment. it includes one of the most ridiculous scenes ever - the introduction of michael's two wives. i don't know whether it's some kind of a mindless metaphor or strange, dark humor, but the chicks are sisters. remember, spacey's character has kids.ordinary decent criminal is complex and confusing. you are not waiting for a funny scene. instead, you carefully follow the dialog, because there is a big possibility of losing yourself into the boring, pale universe, the film has inhabited.let's go back to spacey. i wonder in what condition he has been, signing for that movie. it's not miscasting, but something much worse. an insult to his work in american beauty, released an year before ordinary decent criminal. the character michael is eccentric and talkative. spacey is almost pathetic at times. the only cure for this, is thinking of lester burnham and roger kint.writer, gerrard stembridge should definitely re-consider his screen writing abilities and be more objective this time. because, the dialog is very weak and the scenes are often pointless. and we are still talking about a comedy.ordinary decent criminal is a really bad crime comedy which does not deserve your attention.

an oirish film not made for an irish audience. with fiorentino, baxendale and spacey each incapabable of a half decent oirish accents the powers-that-be had but one choice - force the irish actors to adopt equally bad oirish accents, reducing the whole thing to the lowest common denominator.

writer-director emilio estevez shows a definite lack of talent here with this un-redeemable, supposed comedy. the script is completely hopeless, let alone the fact that it is unoriginal and badly worked. the comedy just does not work. when estevez isn't using poor taste sex jokes, he is borrowing used gags and re-doing them very poorly. you would think the teaming of estevez and brother charlie sheen would be cool...but...it isn't.the entire cast is uninspired and unfunny, never managing to raise a laugh, and barely coaxing a smile from their audience. do yourself a favour and leave this one on the video shelf.thursday, june 25, 1992 - video

i was duped into watching this by the many friendly reviews here. boy, are they way off mark! to give this 9 to 10 points and call it "one of the best movies of the 1990ies" is just unjustifiable. the big problem here is lack of pace and a paper-thin plot. it's like slapstick on prozac. everything trundles along predictably and listlessly. the plot is weak to begin with -- two garbage men peep on their foxy neighbour, witness a murder and unravel a waste disposal conspiracy -- and the movie never manages to go much further. there are some amusing situations and decent acting, but that's not anywhere near enough to save this jalopy of a movie.it's simply a comedy that doesn't get its fat ass off the ground, so why waste your time?

this is one of those movies that i watch every time it's on not because i like it, but because it's so bad i can't take my eyes off it (like "battlefield earth" or "3000 miles to graceland"). the first time i watched i kept waiting and waiting and waiting to laugh and didn't get my chance until about 3/4 of the way through the movie when they strip the harassing cops to their undies and handcuff them in the park in a unflattering position. beyond that, the jokes aren't funny, the characters aren't funny, their mishaps and missteps aren't funny...add it up, it's not a very funny movie! not even at a slapstick level! and what's with the reggae soundtrack? it's a movie about two white garbagemen and the music is all reggae. seems out of place, don't it? if you like a good trainwreck, this is for you. if you like a good comedy, look elsewhere.

this movie is bad as we all knew it would be. most times i usually love the bad 80s / early 90s trash-can comedy (haha no pun intended). i list ski school, career opportunities, hot shots, summer school and many more made around this time. this even has the classic yet forgotten comedy of dean cameron (aka.. ski school section 8 instructor and party maniac for summer school). but this movie is just to slow. it takes almost 30 min to get going and we have to sit through pointless dialog between to half-wits the sheen boys (e&c). and yes i can hear the bloggers dieing to trash me with "obviously you don't watch 2 and 1/2 men). well charlie was not at the level he is now during this flick...not that he's anything worth watching now. charlie only shines when his co-stars support him and emilio isn't anymore than an overused wonder bra offering little support. actually, this movie was written by emilio and it shows. it has no real ending (come on emilio, even the ski school 2 writers barfed out an ending). no idea how any issue brought is solved, no hot babes, no swearing to lighten the bad plot, characters, acting... i'm now tired of this tirade. just save your time and watch the movies i listed above. you'll enjoy them much more.

this 'documentary' sheds absolutely no light on what it would be like to be backstage during the hard knock life tour. granted, i wasn't there, but watching this film didn't make me feel like i was. and for a film like this, that's not exactly a compliment. the whole time i watched it, all i could think was, "what are they leaving out?" when it's all over, the only rapper you feel like you have some insight into is dmx, and that's mainly because he just talks about his dogs. a waste of time.3/10

try not to see this one. i thought it was going to be good because i'm a fan of cheesy 80's films and i've enjoyed quite a bit of linnea quigley's work. i was wrong. i should have said "no" and watched gigli instead, which is probably a far better film. i guess my biggest problem with this film was its attempt at humor. nothing about it was funny or even close to funny. the acting is bad, even for the queen of cheesy 80's films. there is no story, just random clips. i guess i shouldn't hate it so much because it was just made as a fun and silly piece but i didn't have any fun and i wasn't entertained once. i even had to fast forward to the ending to get through all of the crap. i'm sorry, but i don't find zombies doing aerobics funny.

as a helpful warning for others, i believe "skeleton man" is actually worse than "raptor island." i have been using ri as an example of the worst original movie presented on the sci-fi channel, but sm is the most laughably incoherent and wretchedly designed movie i have yet seen. yes, i did watch almost the whole thing, coming into it about 35 minutes into it. it drew me in with its pure ineptitude. what was sci-fi thinking? once skeleton man and the surviving platoon leader (or whatever he was--i'm not good on military unit terminology) reached the chemical plant, the movie moved into a zone of impossible nonsense that was almost mesmerizing. i had the same idea as another viewer who wondered if more than one movie had someone been edited together to make one terrible whole.

i have very few to add to what all the other reviewers already made more than clear! this movie is awful! beyond awful... in fact, so insufferable that they have yet to come up with a term to describe the awfulness that is "skeleton man". in case you expect your movies to feature a minimum of logic and plot, you should stay as far away from this as humanly possible. sure, loads of people are getting killed by this skeleton-puppet wearing a ridiculous cape, but nobody ever bothers to properly explain what he is, where he comes from or why he's so angry with the world. he looks like a crossover between skeletor from "masters of the universe" and the horseman from "sleepy hollow" and runs amok in some godforsaken wilderness. the setting of "skeleton man" is another totally retarded aspect! for nearly half an hour, i assumed that the movie took place at a small isolated island, but it simply plays at the mainland where fancy highways cross the forest and power plants are located at the end of the woods! huh? why does everybody pretend to be trapped when there are like a million escape routes? anyway, after a couple of totally random killings, a special commando squad, led by poor washed-up michael rooker, arrives to come and hunt a monster they don't know anything about. really hilarious is how every member of this squad introduces him/herself as the expert in a certain field (we have a sniper-specialist, a tracking genius, a drill instructor...), yet they all die before any of them is able to demonstrate their supposedly masterful skills! the horror gods must really hate casper van dien, as he's present again as well, portraying an heroic soldier who steals a truck for no apparent reason, crashes on the highway, but somehow gets catapulted back to the middle of the woods to die there. right, that makes sense... furthermore the characters steal cool one-liners from "predator", the bonehead's horse constantly changes colors, helicopters are brought down with bow& arrows, ordinary bullets cause trees to explode and completely pointless vietnam flashbacks haunt michael rooker. i say we all combine forces and vote this pathetic flick into the imdb bottom top 100 asap!

the scientist charles and his wife (or assistant) marissa receive some objects and a skull from an ancient indian cemetery, and while cleaning a vase, they are attacked and murdered by a mysterious being, the skeleton man. then, a military squad commanded by captain leary (michael rooker) seeks out two groups of four soldiers each that vanished in the jungle. they face the skeleton man, shooting him while he kills each soldier. then the skeleton man goes to a power plant, and captain leary explodes the facility destroying the supernatural being.i bought "skeleton man" on dvd expecting to see a funny trash, but i found an awfully boring, annoying and senseless crap, with shoots and explosions. the imbecile story is totally disconnected and does not make any sense, and the military team is composed of imbeciles, insisting in shooting the supernatural skeleton man until they are totally slaughtered. their leader is also the most stupid, with the blow-up of an entire facility in the end to destroy the supernatural rip-off of the extraterrestrial warrior predator. on dvd, it is possible to use the fast forward button along the movie and reduce the suffering of the viewer. my vote is two.title (brazil): "skeleton man"

as i write this, no user reviews are in yet, but there are 17 votes with a 4.8 average, so apparently some people thought this movie had its moments. i didn't notice any, and even if i had i don't think i could have stopped rolling my eyes for long enough to appreciate them.a common debate among movie buffs is whether major mistakes in science, police tactics, and the like so common in b movies should detract significantly from one's enjoyment. i tend to fall into the "yes, that's a reasonable reaction" camp -- especially when the mistakes are central to the plot. with this movie, i look forward to reading how anyone can defend this mess. they completely botch pretty much every aspect of military tactics and strategy, police tactics, weapons, science, folklore, common sense, and human behavior (outside of b movies, that is.) in short, i can't think of any non-trivial thing they got right.any movie would have its work cut out for it when its central premise is a supernatural spirit, impervious to all small arms, able to disappear into another dimension at will, and yet apparently vulnerable to simply a bigger explosion. (they don't make ghosts like they used to.) combine this premise with every detail being wrong and you have a memorably bad movie.

this ranks up there as the worst movies of all time. no research or thought at all went into this movie. action scenes were thrown in at random intervals which made no sense in the context of the movie. items appeared and disappeared at random, etc. it's obvious that this was directed by a "stunt coordinator", who should go back to his old job. the skeleton man rode a horse throughout the movie, which amazingly, could change color at will. either that, or someone thought the audience would all be colorblind and not notice. blood would be on the actors in 1 scene and the very next, miraculously disappear and then reappear. seems that everyone connected with this movie forgot to check for inconsistencies.

although casper van dien and michael rooker are generally relegated to b movies, even they are above this movie. it fails to convey even the slightest sense of excitement, fear, or dread -- unless you count the dread of sitting through the rest of this garbage. the direction is amateurish with annoying cuts and jerky movement that hides the fact that the killer is no where near the victims when he attacks. and what a killer he is: a cheap skull mask and a black hood. i liked him better when he was fighting he-man. this is one of the laziest jobs of character design i've ever seen. i mean, it's skeletor! and he's on a horse! this is supposed to be some scary, supernatural creature? how are we supposed to take this seriously? all we get is scenes of this dude riding around the woods on his horse -- which he can barely stay on -- interspersed with scenes of soldiers shooting randomly into the woods, thinking they can shoot a ghost. occasionally, skeletor will shoot someone with an arrow or ride by and stab someone, revealing how corny the effects really are. i generally enjoy sci fi channel fare on a basic cheese level, but this film is too inept for any level of enjoyment. where's dolph lundgren when you need him???

if you like to get a couple of fleeting glimpses of cleavage on some attractive women, there may be a second or two of enjoyment from this film. if you enjoy seeing poorly conceived and executed "action" scenes, there are plenty. if you are both blind and deaf, i still advise you to not have this film on in your presence. it is surely the worst or very close to the worst film i have ever seen. and it does appear that there was some money spent on it. talk about throwing money away! as an editor, i would hope that the "editor(s?)" of this "movie" never again be allowed to edit a film, book, or even a post-it note. as a writer, i would hope that the author(s?) never again be allowed near even a broken crayon. you would think that i am not recommending that you view this movie. not so. tape it (so you may stop your pain when you need to) and educate yourself as to how bad a movie can be.

my wife and i enjoy bad science fiction movies. some movies are so bad they are good. mansquito was one of those. that one was bad but it had some redeeming qualities. it makes you wonder how a self respecting actor approaches lines like "hey! mansquito!"this one is so bad it has now taken its place as our standard for bad. it isn't just a bad movie, it really stinks. there was the coed strike force, the "indian" that rode around in a black cloak and used a sword for crying out loud. he shot down a helicopter with an arrow!! we tried to laugh at this movie but there were no points at which it didn't rise above pitiful. we couldn't come up with any redeeming features except for one. those were the words "the end"there seemed to be no plot, no character development, and no point to the movie. someone in hollywood needs to be fired.

to be honest, the movie was so horrible that i loved it. never in my life have a seen such a terrible movie. i was in shock. i mean, i don't even know what to say.the characters couldn't even keep their own guns, one minute a guy had an m16 and his friend had an mp5, then in the next scene they switched guns. (don't ask, trust me i know my guns)and i will never understand how they got from a place that looked like vietnam, to an arizona highway, to my backyard, and then to a chemical plant in california, that is what i took from it.why would you be afraid of a guy in a halloween mask wearing a trash bag for a cape and shot plastic arrows at you? how is that frightening? i wanted to swallow arsenic halfway through the movie. i love how the "skeleton man" randomly decided to go on a killing spree at that particular day. but hey, whoever made this movie should be shot in the knees and fed to a mound of fire ants.good day.

thank god for dvr and the high speed of it's fast forward. even with that i couldn't sit through any more of that travesty. when they came across the old indian asking for beans i gave up and erased it. is this the best that scifi channel can come up with for saturday nights? how about some old classics instead? the idea of a coed special forces unit was bad enough. it seems like they wanted to save money by having everything filmed out in the woods. what more can i say? it was so awful that i don't think i can come up with enough lines to qualify for space to review it. but, it looks like one more line will do it. save your time, let alone your money on this dog of a film.

wow, where to begin with this one. well, if you enjoy laughing at the utter failures of filmmakers, then this one is for you. i bought this movie for 5 bucks because i never pass up an opportunity to laugh at b-movie god casper van dien's blunders, and boy was this one of them. it may have been enough that this movie contains the single most lame movie monster ever. this thing, which is supposed to be an indian ghost, looks more like a plastic candy bowl skeleton that you put on your front porch on halloween. he dons a cape that is clearly a garbage bag, complete with what appears to be a bucket-shaped bonnet over his head. at some points this is a man in costume, at others it is clearly a plastic prop placed on top of a horse. this monster has the uncanny ability to see with "predator" vision, a clear rip-off, and can miraculously appear after throwing his spear. sometimes the spear cuts people, sometimes it doesn't. this thing also manages to down a helicopter with a single arrow. wow, this makes a much sense as when the kid blows up a spaceship with a firecracker at the end of "critters." this creature is impervious to bullets, but somehow dies at the end of the movie. at the end of his killing spree, which we never really find out why he is on, he gets blown up. this is an incredible feat, for we had already seen this thing blow up 3 times in the film. but, i guess this last time was the charm. and don't even get me started on the lameness of the other characters. first of all, what delta force unit employs women? last i checked the military still disallows women into combat situations. also, this unit is "undercover." why? what possible reason would they have to be undercover? and they're not even good at it, i guess no one would realize that they were military if they didn't have on uniforms, but they were all carrying machine guns (which incidentally change sound effects throughout the film, at some points sounding like air rifle bb guns, and at others, canons). there is one part when the skeleton man throws some construction workers from a catwalk, and you can clearly see the pad that they fall onto. at another point. michael rooker falls down a hill that is clearly flat ground. they tilted the camera slightly to give the appearance of an incline, but he is clearly pushing himself along in this looooooonnnnnggggggg fall scene. then when he is helped back up the hill, the rope is flat, and when it shows the woman at the "top" of the "hill" the rope goes upward from her grip, not the way it would look if she was pulling someone up a hill. rooker actually has a line that says, "i'm not going after him, i going after it." what? that is quite possibly the dumbest thing i have ever heard, and i watch these bad movies as a hobby. the saddest part about this quote is that you can tell that everyone involved in the writing/production of this film thought that it was so bad-ass. believe it or not, compared to the rest of the dialog, this is good. the acting, bad. the makeup, really bad. these characters either had scars or wounds that liked to change sides of their face. maybe these are alien scars that like to run around on your face. yeah, i think i'll make a movie about that, "attack of the alien scars that move around on your face." that villain would be more intimidating than the skeleton man, and the film would probably be scarier.

where to start? some guy has some indian pot that he's cleaning, and suddenly skeletor attacks. he hits a woman in the neck with an axe, she falls down, but then gets up and is apparently uninjured. she runs into the woods, and it turns out there's the basement of a shopping center out there in the woods. she meets a utility worker and skeletor attacks again. luckily, like any good utility worker, he's got a gun and shoots at the guy. doesn't work, everything starts on fire.cut to some people walking through the woods. even though they've been hiking together for some time, they sit down and introduce themselves to each other. wouldn't they have probably done that when they first met? anyhow, they're "undercover" delta team members (undercover, i suppose, because that way they don't have to pay to dress them in uniforms). the cute girls are various things such as a sniper school instructor and, oh, i can't remember the rest. it doesn't matter. eventually they all take their guns out and immediately start aiming them at various things. ? anyhow, they meet an old indian who is sitting out in the woods. he wants beans. you know, like pork and beans? he mumbles some stuff, i can only assume that it's the premise of the movie. i relied on having heard the premise from the commercials, because you can't really understand anything he says.so, they walk around the woods some more. all the dialogue is a load of quasi-military, macho bs. i mean all of it, as in every single word. like "this reminds me of when we were in kabul" or "this reminds me of when we were in laos". skeletor attacks again. let me give you a rundown of a basic attack. one of the female characters is crouched behind a tree and she aims her gun at the approaching guy on the horse. for some reason, she doesn't fire but yells several times for someone else. then as skeletor approaches, she jumps out from behind the tree so that skeletor can stick her with his spear. then everybody starts shooting. the bullets cause sparks to fly from the trees. apparently the folks who made this movie never shot a tree with a bullet. they don't make sparks.then casper van diem is all of a sudden driving a semi-truck, trying to run over skeletor. he misses, and the truck slides to a stop. van diem is injured, apparently he slid across the seat and bumped his hip on the window crank or something, so he crawls out of the truck and it explodes. later he's in the woods dying and everybody says a bunch of quasi-military, macho bs. they meet a couple guys in the woods and blow their "undercover" status by immediately identifying themselves as being from the army. they beat on the guys for some reason, then they go away.some other stuff happens, people mumble, the camera shakes, etc.i think it comes to an end eventually.my theory is that the sci-fi channel is getting a little annoyed with everyone bashing their movies, so they put this out to remind us all how bad movies can really be. like, you think our movies are bad? well, you haven't seen bad. here's bad!!! okay, now that we've got that out of the way, the rest of our movies are pretty good in comparison, right?well, it's just a theory.

this movie tries to rip off predator, but that movie is much better. this movie has truly terrible special effects and a mindless plot. the team that enters the forest to find the cause of the disappearances of military and scientist is a combo of rough and rugged male delta commandos and pretty but tough female rangers. none of them are too bright. all the characters seem to be more than willing to run off into the forest alone and headfirst into a spear or sword and their death. some of the pyrotechnics are very big and must have cost a bundle. but the close-ups of the creature are laughable as are most of the death scenes. every cliché that the writers could think of was used. if you're looking for a mindless slaughter fest, this may fill the bill. the night i watched this was very slow so i sat through the whole thing. i have to admit that it's been a while since i watched something this bad. there is very little to redeem this movie. i'm amazed that junk like this gets produced.

this was so bad, i want god to give me an extra two hours of life having had to sit through it.first off, the acting was uniformly bad. there was barely a plot, unless "shaggy dog story with a guy in a rain poncho and skeleton mask instead of a dog" counts.the editing was was all over the place, and the slow-mo shots of the "gore" (red corn syrup flying through the air--doubtless flung using a spoon) got irritating after the tenth time, and infuriating after the hundredth time.i like michael rooker. he's done some good work. this was not good. this was less than good. and by that, i mean that it sucked. hard.for god's sake, don't watch this movie.

wow. i thought, eskimo limon was the most awful and embarrassing first-sex movie ever. but i had forgotten that germany always tries to compete. in this case, the well-known german film producer bernd eichinger was successful in producing even worse crap. harte jungs is stupid, not believable and predictable, and above all: not funny. it's almost a tragedy that so many kids went to see this in germany (and, i'm afraid, also austria).tobias schenke, 19, looks too nice to have no girlfriend and too ripe to be 15, and his character is too dumb to be true. schenke tries real hard to make us believe that he doesn't know anything about sex, but that doesn't help. harte jungs seems to be made by someone who watched al bundy and took him too seriously.the best actors in the movie are sissi perlinger and stefan jürgens who play schenke's semi-liberal parents. perlinger and jürgens are stand-up comedians who are not particularly talented in movie acting. still, their performances are the `best' and `funniest' in comparison.a complete failure.

one of the worst movies i saw in the 90s. i'd often use it as a benchmark when viewing other films; "at least it wasn't as bad as caro diario." three absolutely pointless segments, all featuring the director playing himself -- and he's not that interesting. a whole segment about this hypochondriac going to the doctor. another that features him riding around the countryside on his scooter. for three interesting minutes and another fifteen torturous ones.the only redeeming factor was that the scooter scene was set to keith jarrett's 'koln concert'. prompted me to go home and rediscover that marvelous album. the best thing you can say about the director/actor/egotist is that he's got great taste in music.

this film is boring, boring, boring, boring, and boring!!! it's not the worse film i ever saw, on the contrary, but.......how shall i put this.......it's boring! there is some very nice scenery and some clever dry wit but that's about it. if it was advertised as a travelogue i would rate it a 7 but it's supposed to be a film with a plot, some drama, and for god's sake a point or a satisfying conclusion.i read some of the comments on this board about this films and i wondered if they saw the same movie as i did.see this film (yawn) at your own risk........one thing for sure- it really is rated correctly= g rating! (which most stand for god awful boring!)

tandem is an odd slice in the japanese pink genre-as it has the requisite sex-scenes and misogynistic tone that is all but required for these types of films-but also throws in a disjointed drama/dark-comedy storyline that seems like it'd have been better suited for a different type of film. the film starts with two lone guys at a restaurant-each daydreaming about a previous sexual encounter. one is a mutual subway groping, the other a pretty typical (for this type of film) semi-rape scenario. the two pervs meet and start talking after one lends the other a cigarette. they hang out for an evening and talk a bit about their respective sex- lives. the film is inter-cut with flashback scenes of both of the men's interactions with the women that are central in their lives. the two men have a falling out and the film ends on a weird but predictable note... i really don't know what to make of tandem. it sorta comes off as a soft-core, 'odd couple' type of anti-buddy-film, but doesn't really explore the subject-matter to any satisfying degree. there's also not much of the typical extreme sleaziness often so prevalent in these types of films-so i can't really figure out what the point was. i also cant quite tell if the film was supposed to be funny, depressing, or both.  i think that tandem could have had some potential as a more serious drama film with a dark-comedy edge- but as a soft-core sex film that tries to be too 'smart' for its own good-it just doesn't work.   can't say i hated this one-but can't say there's anything notable about it either. 4/10 

oh boy! i really trashed manhunt in space. i think this flopper deservedly rates worse than manhunt. it goes nowhere and fungi growth was more exciting than this tripe.poor cleolanta. she's so misunderstood. smug rocky struts around and thankfully, there's no mention from winky about his "gay nightlife". there's a lot more talking, a really awful (to watch) space marriage on the rocks, and crappy space effects cut-outs. then, there's bobby. you decide who's more annoying: bobby or the winkster? personally, i'd jettison them out of an airlock into a black hole not before first subjecting them to killer flesh eating alien mutants.at least there's vena. she's just a cosmic girl!

i bought this movie for a couple of dollars at a "clearance warehouse sale" one day when just looking around. the cover looked pretty good, (in colour), but the movie is b&w, (i wish they wouldn't try to trap us with coloured covers on b&w movies, but it's a common thing to look out for!).when i watched it i was pleasantly surprised. it turned out to be better than i expected. i was disappointed that it was a b&w, but the effects are pretty good, certainly better than, say, "invaders from mars" which has crappy effects, and it is great to see john banner in something else apart from hogan's heroes.overall, this movie isn't too bad for a b grade, and certainly worth the two dollars from a nostalgia point of view. it isn't my favourite sci-fi, but it's not my worst either. it's o.k.

by all appearances this serial could have been made any time since the mid forties. the cardboard sets, the moon kings with lightning bolts sewn onto their aprons, you know the drill. this one is a rocky jones adventure, featuring the space cop's dealings with the insufferable bitch queen of planet offeecious, a commie planet that won't join the united planets. when the noble messengers of intergalactic reason announce that offeecious is on a collision course with this other, vaguely slavic planet, bitch queen decides to blow the other guys up rather than evacuate her land. this introduces a moral to the effect of "the greatness of a nation is not in its land, but its people," which is hammered home five or six times in the climactic talkfest. the bq's constant nasal ranting about "offeeeecious" provides relief from some seriously wanting space effects, is this a tv show?

there's not really that much wrong with crash of the moons. basically it's a few episodes of rocky jones, space ranger merged into a film. it is extremely dated, however. winky's treatment of vena is a good example of this. one has to remember that it was geared to be shown to children in the 1950's. in this respect, it succeeds. if you like children's sci-fi from the 1950's, go ahead and take a look at it. you'll see john banner in a pre-sgt. schultz role. he does a pretty good job in it. all in all, i'd give it a 6 out of 10. not great, but not bad.

i can't say i was surprised at this atrocity when i watched it a couple months or weeks ago (can't remember). i saw it as a two part episode of zoey 101, because that's how they showed it here in canada.i was incredibly annoyed at the makeover a nerd thing, it's just an example of how unaccepting, unappreciating, superficial, negative, biased, and stereotypical the people in the entertainment business is and frankly i'm extremely peeved. it wasn't at all funny. a nerd is a stereotype and it makes people very offended.secondly, the people in zoey 101 don't have real problems. logan has a big house, he has a famous dad, he has everything and zoey is rich too. they never have to deal with the things that today's tweens and teens have to do deal with such as peer pressure, and stereotype problems. also, the actors are horrific. jamie lynn spears doesn't deserve to be in a television show as successful as zoey 101 (what is wrong with the world?), she doesn't have any talent as an actor. in fact, she's worse than britney! the chase and zoey thing was incredibly predictable, i mean how could the show go on with zoey and chase dating? what other problems could they possibly have? except for the fact that chase doesn't get the girl he wants, everything is perfect! the absolute worse 48 minutes of my television watching life. ever. 0/10 (and that's being generous)

oh my god, this is so idiotic. completely pointless, offensive, and repulsive. why do the writers have such a problem with actually getting zoey and chase together we all want them too! in normal shows, there's actually more than one plot conflict in the show, wow, what a concept. also, you cant even tell the zoey 101 episodes apart from each other because the same thing happens every time. quinn exploits dustin for some weird thing, nicole is giggly and stupid, zoey is just kinda there, chase slobbers after her all the time but she amazingly fails to notice, and logan is a jerk. repeat. quinn exploits dustin for some weird thing, nicole is giggly and stupid, zoey is just kinda there, chase slobbers after her all the time but she amazingly fails to notice, and logan is a jerk. repeat. it's like a shampoo bottle. and the end of the movie, omg again. so pointless nothing happens. it's like they specifically designed it so that the movie could fit between any two episodes of the show and the show would go completely unchanged after the movie plot.

ughh this movie is awful. the script is stupid and of course chase doesn't tell zoey he doesn't love her!!! like every episode...ill never understand zoey 101 (the show) also , why the heck does logan's dad act so retarted. and its only about zoey and chase what about the other characters. its always the same in every episode quinn makes and invention something goes terribly wrong with the invention and zoeys brother always gets involved in it. if you haven't seen it don't waste an hour watching this cuz you'll be wasting your time!!smaybe this may be interesting to an eight year old well 8- 10 but i cnat imagine any1 older watching this retarted film. but what can you expect from nick???

oh god. why is it that nickelodeon has such a hard time producing even a half-decent movie? i mean, this movie might have been good, but it was:a. too short b. rather superficial, stereotypical, and insulting to some c. ultimately pointlessfirst of all, the "dress up the nerd to look cool" thing was very consumerist, very superficial, very pointless, and very insulting. it has the stereotypical nerds-stupid faces, glasses, never kissed, vacations with his mom, etc. well maybe the reason that guy has never kissed a girl is because he's gay! does that mean that all gays are nerds? and what's wrong with being friends with your mother?the worst part, by far, was the ending. the whole drama of the movie revolved around zoey finding out chase loved her, and blah blah blah, and then, when chase finally decided to tell her, a. he didn't tell her in person because right as he was about to the typical distraction came along b. he tried to text message her, but her pda fell into a fountain and died before she got the message.the end.how lame is that????? i mean, why is it that cartoonists just can't change anything in the series? so many of us would like to see these two get together. why can't we see it? i mean, are the producers really that uncreative, that they can't think up new problems to go with changes in the series? so they have to stick with the same plot and outlines, and make as many episodes as they can just using those? after a while, it gets dull and frustrating.i wanted to see some actual romance in here, darn it!okay. i'm done with my rant.

this is one of crichton's best books. the characters of karen ross, peter elliot, munro, and amy are beautifully developed and their interactions are exciting, complex, and fast-paced throughout this impressive novel.and about 99.8 percent of that got lost in the film. seriously, the screenplay and the directing were horrendous and clearly done by people who could not fathom what was good about the novel. i can't fault the actors because frankly, they never had a chance to make this turkey live up to crichton's original work. i know good novels, especially those with a science fiction edge, are hard to bring to the screen in a way that lives up to the original. but this may be the absolute worst disparity in quality between novel and screen adaptation ever. the book is really, really good. the movie is just dreadful.

i just watched congo on dvd.in most cases i love these kind of movies but this one is different. it made me write my first comment for a movie on imdb. i was amazed how such a team of experienced filmmakers could come up with this movie as a result. you can see there was a lot of money for this production but you can't make a good movie if you don't have a good script. and as a producer frank marshall gave us plenty of great movies to watch; he never should have tried to become another spielberg. this one shows how hard it is to make a good movie, maybe you've got all the ingredients but if you can't cook stay out of the kitchen. if can make a suggestion don't spend your money on this one. if you want to see it watch it on television first and make up your own mind.

congo is probably the worst big-budget movie of the 1990s. it is so bad that it is watchable over and over again. a bunch of folks with different agendas probe deep into darkest africa, where they encounter a temple of riches just like in king solomon's mines -- but with cannibalistic gorillas guarding those riches. on their side, the humans have a "talking" gorilla named amy who helps save the day at one point or another. so much for the plot. the dialogue throughout is witless, the acting almost uniformly atrocious, certainly campy (tim curry and ernie hudson are both on hand to assure the ham factor), and the special effects abysmal. wait until you see the cannibalistic gorillas. and the lava! oh yes, did i mention there's a volcanic eruption to top off the big finale? laura linney of all people is along for this bumpiest of rides. what could she have been thinking? this is right around the same time she appeared with richard gere and ed norton in primal fear, a movie that helped guarantee her stardom.

this was a highly-hyped movie prior to its release, but turned out to be a dud. i never talked to one person who ever liked this movie. i agree: i didn't like it, either. perhaps one big reason it wasn't a box office success was that it had nothing but unappealing characters in the story.for awhile there - i don't know if this is still true - i hadn't any movie in which laura linney or dylan walsh played anything but annoying characters.that, and a stupid story, make this film a big disappointment, especially considering that big buildup. did the filmmakers, with dialog this dumb, really think this was going to be a hit?

if you can make it through this flick without laughing out loud at the screen, you are a better filmgoer than i.count the logic lapses, common-sense leaps, and credibility stretches... betcha need more than two hands!p.s.: if one more film uses a location that is clearly ucla, and claims that it is a different university (in this movie's case: berkeley), i'm going to lose it.

i love bad movies: showgirls, plan 9 from outerspace, so on. and this movie fits right in. don't believe anyone who tells you this is good film. it's downright awful. tim curry's accent moves from german to portuguese to hungarian. there's a person in a gorilla suit who is supposed to be able to communicate using a glove that interprets the ape's sign language. there is a scene with a killer hippo that moves around a river like a great white shark. there are people hopping up and down mt. kilimanjaro as if there were escalators installed on it. this thing is laughably ridiculous. so ridiculous i was rolling on the floor. it is totally implausible. i loved every minute of it.

anyone who has seen the piece of steaming smelly poo called congo understands my title. and i feel for you. this movie wasn't just bad. it was painful. the book was stupid, the script was even dumber and the cast was terrible. dylan walsh? rumor has it julia roberts dumped your ass cause this movie blew so bad. huge diamonds? killer gorillas? talking gorillas? hmmm. sounds like a hit! oh! tim curry's accent is so bad in this movie i would prefer being deaf! i recommend this movie to bulimics looking to purge after a heavy meal or kavorkian patients who just need that one more reason to die. if this is faithful to the book, i would say lets have us a good old fashion footloose book burning and destroy every copy. if future generations look back and find this garbage, how would we explain ourselves? listen to the others who hated this movie! don't watch it! run away! do not watch this movie! if you think it is full of action or suspense or cool effects, you are wrong! if you think it blows more cock than nicole ritchie, you'd be right. so if you still are going to watch crapo..,.i mean congo, i say do it after you just took 50 tylenol pm.

the book, while not particularly great, was decent, but this movie completely changes it. a lot of the elements of the story are consistent between the book and the movie, but dr. ross' character goes from a creatively written character who lives for money and ends up causing the volcanic eruption with her greed to a heart-on-her-sleeve damsel in distress who won't do anything if she even catches the slightest hint that it might be less than noble. when movies change the book that much but keep the same name, it should be a crime.

let's see: there's a civil war, a lost city, a talking gorilla, some regular gorillas, a previously unknown species of killer albino gorilla, the most powerful laser ever known to man, a *lot* of diamonds lying mined and loose in the sand, attack hippos, an active volcano, and a hot air balloon packed in a suitcase in a downed plane. that's not too much, is it? i've had more coherent fever dreams ("... and then the romanian guy picked up a bunch of diamonds, because this was a lost city that he had been looking for or something, but then the mean gorillas that we had seen before came out of nowhere and ate him. now somehow the talking gorilla was back from visiting the regular gorillas, and, as a kind of earthquake or volcano started, the woman industrialist/doctor built a gun using a laser and this big diamond she had just found in her dead fiance's hand..."). it's a blast if you're looking for more ammunition against the pernicious influence of michael crichton in american entertainment (and hence world entertainment), and if you keep firmly in mind the extent to which this cynical and half-hearted attempt fell on its face at the boxoffice. but, sadly, the men responsible -- crichton, sceenwriter john patrick shanley, director frank marshall -- probably never lost a dime. shame on them, and i mean that. 1/10

"congo" is based on the best-selling novel by michael crichton, which i thought lacked crichton's usual charm, smart characters and punch. well, sorry to say, but the same goes for the film.here's the plot:greed is bad, this simple morality tale cautions. a megalomaniacal c.e.o. (joe don baker) sends his son into the dangerous african congo on a quest for a source of diamonds large enough and pure enough to function as powerful laser communications transmitter (or is it laser weapons?). when contact is lost with his son and the team, his daughter-in-law (laura linney), a former cia operative and computer-freak, is sent after them. on her quest, she is accompanied by gee-whiz gadgetry and a few eccentric characters (including a mercenary (ernie hudson), a researcher with a talking gorilla (dylan walsh), and a a nutty indiana-jones-type looking for king solomon's mines (tim curry). after some narrow escapes from surface-to-air missiles and some african wildlife, they all discover that often what we most want turns out to be the source of our downfall. the actors in this movie were not talented. dylan walsh acts like a pathetic crybaby, especially at the end; ernie hudson is unconvincing (is it no wonder he went on to star in tv films?) and laura linney is nothing special. i think i can safely say the only talented actors in this film had very small roles: joe don baker and tim curry, an always enjoyable actor (although sometimes scarred for life by constantly being reminded of his "rocky horror picture" days). this movie also had some other problems, including awful direction style, cheesy dialogue and a just-plain-boring plot, which was completely hashed when compared to crichton's novel. not even stan winston's creature effects could save this movie from being a disaster. i am deeply disappointed in this movie; there was not even a campy quality to redeem itself with. it was just plain awful, cheesy, boring and ridiculous, and proves to be one of the worst crichton book-to-film productions.2/5 stars -john ulmer

i'd give this film a zero if i could. how anyone could rate it any higher is beyond me. until i saw rollerball, this was my pick for worst film ever from a major studio with a real budget (claiming mangler 2 or leprechaun in the hood as the worst ever isn't really saying much, those are supposed to be bad)tim curry's mom must have needed surgery or something for him to agree to this non-sensical garbage. i'm really not sure what happened here. the novel was great, the director frank marshall had a solid track record with alive and arachnophobia (perhaps they should have changed the title to 'africa'), the cast was good and the budget was there. you'd think someone would have bothered to read the script.you'd be better off watching battlefield: earth again than wasting your time with. congo makes you long for the return of mst3k

publicity got me to the theatreadvice will take you away from this waist of time.very bad everything.do you really want to see a monkey talking with a technological device?x

after a string of successful 'a man and his monkey films', which included the seminal "every which way but loose", "every which way you can" and "peter's friends", the genre fell on hard times. in an effort to rejuvenate this once celebrated area, director frank marshall brought michael crichton's acclaimed novel to the big screen.think 'gorillas in the mist' meets 'tron' minus the box-office clout of bruce boxleitner. this is one mans doomed love affair for his talking monkey. not helped by bad accents (tim curry struggles with a romanian), a baboon of a screenplay, hungry hippos, skydiving primates and bruce campbell. ape-sh*t.

the problem with making a movie like this, though, is that the finale, the crème-de-la-creme of the movie, the battle between the two souped-up ships, must be done well. disappointingly, this scene in ironclads is obviously done completely with little model ships in an overgrown tub. there's no tension, little explanation of what exactly is going on and what the timeframe is of the stand-off.the film takes quite a few liberties with the surrounding story, as all true stories do when converted to a movie, such as the union traitor and most notably that of betty stuart (madsen), a virginia belle.it resorts to making a possibly-decent movie involving an interesting story on the ironclads to preaching about the evils of slavery. it was out of place in this historical drama, and was a cheap ploy to bring in the women viewers. it only succeeded in lessening the positives about the film.

...but memorable because it includes an actor i actually recognize! james horan is, by these types of movies' standards, lawrence olivier. he's given some decent performances on stuff like highlander and various star treks, so it's kind of amusing, if mildly depressing, watching him degrade himself here. okay, yeah, there's a plot. horan's character and his wife are fighting, he's having an affair with a movie reviewer while trying to do his "masterpiece" film, and their guest decides to enjoy the wonders of stripping. but watching horan is really the only enjoyment to be found here.

victor jory never became a major star. he is better known for later character roles than for his early leads. but he was very handsome and an excellent actor.his love scenes with loretta young in this romantic adventure thriller are passionate. their kisses look very real. and very modern.vivienne osborne is a standout here also. she plays a woman with a reputation. but the character has a good heart.the print i saw was not clear. but what a joy that rare movies like this are turning up! and they are, in some sort of watchable condition, still intact. this is nothing truly special. but if one is willing to sift through movies of its era with similarly intriguing titles, one is likely to find some suprtb movies.

i'm so glad i only got this movie for $5. anime is expensive, no doubt about that. i've had my eye on this one for awhile and finally i saw it on sale. i grabbed it immediately and took it home only to hang my head in disappointment. this movie sucked. i've heard people talk about how gory and violent this movie is. it's really not that gory or violent. i've watched it three times, and i think i've wasted enough of my life on this. the demons get a point for being unique and kinda cool at times. the sex gets a point since it's almost non-stop. the horny old man gets half-a-point for being horny and still having the sex drive. and the main character (who's name i've erased from my mind) gets half-a-point for the cool design of his gun. i saw major connections between this movie and demon city shinjuku. both have same style animation, that's obvious because of the director, both have lame soundtracks which suck like the antichrist, and both have terrible endings. avoid this movie unless you're into anime sex.

corny and horrible, i was not surprised this short lived show didn't make it. i remember fondly when tales from the crypt tried reusing these corny episodes like they were actually scary. coupled with bad acting and lousy music, i was surprised this crummy showed was ever conceived. it never showed up again, and one can only be thankful for this circumstance.

this is a very interesting acquaintance! "two-fisted tales" contains three foolish and childish episodes - genre isn't actually horror or action, more like something in between. where's the suspence? where's the fun? where's the common sense? definitely not in here but if you don't expect to get it, you don't necessarily miss it.first segment is called "showdown". it's a violent, absurd western. i failed to understand the whole idea of it. "king of the road" is a stupid story starring brad pitt. at the time of "two-fisted tales" he was just a pretty face who really didn't know how to act yet. luckily he learned the skill later and now he's a fantastic, talented actor - one of the big ones of the younger generation. story is almost ok in all of it's stupidness. final episode "yellow" is the only segment that's almost entirely successful. it's foolish but funny. we have to thank kirk douglas for that.this movie is something to watch when you sit in an easy chair and eat popcorn. (i should know, that's what i did) if you loved "tales from the crypt", you'll love "two-fisted tales" too because basically it's all the same. i understand these three episodes are actually extremely rare "piece of art" and very difficult to find anywhere. i have the whole package on vhs but i don't think it's a big privilege. you'll have to be a fanatic brad pitt fan to search it out. otherwise don't bother, it's not worth the effort. silly crap.

wakayama tomisaburo's portrayal of fugitive ex-kaishakunin ogami itto felt entirely natural. his demeanor, his voice, his appearance- all of it spoke to dislodgement. when he entered a space i, as well as characters on the screen, could feel he didn't belong there and that his determination to be there spelled trouble.i read somewhere that mr. wakayama actually took kendo (japanese swordsmanship) training and that would explain his comfort with the katana, which showed magnificently in every cutfest. if you watch the movies, from the moment he draws to the moment he sheaths the sword you feel as though you were witnessing something inevitably ugly. he'd even spin the katana quickly to flick off the blood before sheathing it and it would happen in an effortless instant.nakamura kinnosuke's rendition comes across as a rendition. it feels as though he were trying too hard to be someone else or tell someone else's story. as a result, every time i tried to engage i'd lose my grip because he didn't seem to have a firm grip on the role, himself. as though it were awkward for him.the swordsmanship in the tv series was entirely old-school hollyweird, too. camera cuts to disguise mr. nakamura's awkwardness with the katana, slow action, targets sitting still, etc. extremely bad, from a viewer's perspective. there was a moment in the episode the castle wall attack when mr. nakamura drew his sword like a child. it was embarrassing. he handled it as though it were heavy! i almost fell off my chair.and let's be frank: the story is about an excellent swordsman. period. swordsmanship is an issue.realism isn't, however: the swordplay in the movies was excellent and manga-like, as was intended, i'm sure. (the baby cart was outfitted with a cluster of automatic, rapid-fire muskets operated by a 3 year old? yes...manga-style.) it's how the story seamlessly weaves historical cultural accuracy into, basically, superhero fantasy that makes the movies captivating. (read yoshikawa eiji's musashi [%historical legend]%!) i couldn't really sit through the tv series episodes. they just felt cheap. see the movies first and you'll know what i'm talking about.

i was quite excited when i saw this film in competition at the montreal film festival. along with elephant and a few others, i thought the issue of american gun violence/culture would be treated intelligently and in a fashion compelling for film-goers. the press-release promised (in not so many words) a `red violin' for the gun-violence crowd, something to make us ponder our nra-shoot-em-up mindset in this country.after waiting until after 9:15 to be seated for a 9am screening (what technical difficulties they would have encountered is beyond me), we were finally let into the venue to see the film on dv (where did the advertised 35mm print go?). i think i just answered my first question.the result is an abhorrent mess. we get the "gun", in a vignette with the most unrealistic "biker' i have ever seen (and i do know more than a few). the film then lapses into irrelevant "character development" only because the characters are either a. stereotyped, b. losers, c. stereotyped losers, and/or d. racial caricatures. it takes another 30 minutes to get to the plot movement, and once we are there, we wish for the inane conversations between the couples and/or the bikers and pawn brokers.the film finds it's conclusion, but not without leaving any cliché untried. i didn't care for the white-trash characters who came in contact with the gun, and the depiction of the minority characters should have the naacp crying foul immediately. all these people would chase after a gun, because they are at the bottom of the societal trash-heap, and would look for an opportunity wherever it was found. placing the action a level up would have at least provided some soul-searching on the part of the characters.the biggest problem is the promise unfulfilled. the plot outline was great. in the hands of a p.t. anderson or gus van zandt, it could have been a powerful piece. but due either to bad screenplay, direction or both, the thing is an unmitigated mess that needs to be ignored at all costs.my bigger question is who at the mff thought this was competition material. better bury this on showtime at 3am.art blose

the gun is probably the worst film i've ever saw. the comedians direction is very poor, the dialogs sounds like they were written by a 13 year old teenager, the plot (what plot?) is another "suspense" in which it is very hard to get into. finally, nothing in this movie is any good. a big thumbs down to everyone involved and particularly to the montreal film festival who presented this movie in competition!

at the beginning of 'loggerheads', we're introduced to three pairs of seemingly unrelated characters. to make matters even more confusing, we're informed (via titles on the screen) that the action is taking place in three separate time lines (between the years 1999 and 2001). it takes a great deal of time but eventually we come to see how the three pairs are related: mark austin, a young man in his 20s, gay and hiv positive is estranged from his conservative parents, elizabeth and rev. robert austin. mark is now a drifter and arrives in kure beach, north carolina, a seaside town, where he meets george (sensitively played by michael kelly), a gay motel owner and they eventually become involved with each other. meanwhile, mark's birth mother, grace (played by bonnie hunt) has come to the point in her life where she has decided to find the son she gave up for adoption when she was 17. similarly, mark's adoptive mother, also has decided to track her estranged son as she misses him (despite the misgivings of her homophobic minister husband).'loggerheads' we're told is based on a true story and that perhaps is its achilles heel. director/writer tim kirkman tries too hard to create scenes fraught with dramatic tension where there is very little to be found. take mark and georgethey're both sensitive souls who have little to disagree about. there's some slight tension when grace faces off against an adoption agency director who is forbidden by law to give her any information about her lost son as well as a slight conflict with her mother who denies that she disapproved of her when she became pregnant as a teenager. no sparks fly either between elizabeth and robert since the good reverend has adamantly insisted from the beginning that he has no intention of reconciling with his son. 'loggerheads' is similar to 'brokeback mountain' in that the gay couple are the good guys and the straight males (for example, the kure beach cop and the reverend) are the baddies. the biggest letdown of the movie is that there is no interaction (and hence no dramatic conflict) between mark and either one of his 'mothers'. mark is already dead before either the birth or adoptive mother has a chance to reconcile with him. kirkman's theme is both a plea for tolerance and an exhortation for family members to express their heartfelt feelings before it's too late! kirkman's sentiments are for the most part well-intentioned but they do not make for good drama. loggerheads moves along at a snail's pace without providing any new revelations (or suspense) regarding such topics as aids, adoption and homophobia. ultimately 'loggerheads' fails due to a lack of originality.

for many months i was looking forward to this release. the previews looked good, early reports on the net were encouraging, and golden eye and timesplitters were excellent shooters (by the same people). it turns out i was greatly misled! haze had the potential to be up there with call of duty 4 and other next gen shooters, however it looks, plays and feels like something from 5 years or so ago. i played haze on a 1080 tv and was initially disappointed that the game's developers had limited the graphics to 720. the haze universe lacks detail and atmosphere, the feeling of "they must have really rushed to finish this" is always there.the controls are sluggish and cumbersome, and i have yet to find an adjustment for x/y axis sensitivity . there are many parts of the single player game that are very dark (visually), to the point where you can't actually see where you are going. why not add a torch function like in halo? or even better, night vision? the use of the performance enhancing drug "nectar" is interesting, however just as you get used to it you switch sides and don't use it again! why bother? i could go on with many more haze faults, but instead i'll just say don't bother! wait for killzone 2 or play call of duty 4 and try to unlock the gold ak!

this game is a good looking first person shooter. -----------hang on......but of course a story must be put around this genre, so a quite innovative plot about soldiers now driven by drugs to save the world and kill the terrorist, nectar is the drug of choice which creates a super soldier. great, now just give us some fun, challenging missions, throw in some great new weapons and free terrain vehicles that can be driven at our leisure and i will be quite content.no!!!!the maker's of this game decide to create a propagandish, military driven game, that tries to make sense of our fears of terrorism and embracing democracy. the game has twisted ideals that just re-enforce morals that we learned when we were in primary school, nothing new is told to us, but "drugs are bad...mmmkay". then pushed in a type of ....yvan eht nnnioooojjjjj! (join the navy) of how standing up for the common good, given rants on normality and abnormality, right and wrong....gooooooooood we get it! let's kill something!!!!no!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!you can't, you are forced to endure extremely long gaps of completing bullsh!t objectives such as "run to helicopter"......."go to group of troops" .....then once this is completed.........cinematic takes over.........you sit there for at least half of the game watching little scenario's played out by the characters, one's you cannot skip, but sit and wait, sometimes when people aren't even talking, we sit and wait for a helicopter to land! bad game, by a laughable group of programmers! don't bother making another because i will rather see the movie!

hercules wound up falling into the same category as many promising television productions that could have been a really great classic, only to become a sad joke.i really like kevin sorbo and his supporting cast, but i didn't care for the direction the show took since their movie equivalents either. i believe the show would have had a much more successful run if they had kept the same format they did for the movies.i watched in the beginning and lost interest along the way. i did encounter the odd episode afterwards, but my attention span towards it was lucky to make it to commercial break.

return to frogtown was a hard film to track down. well, i accomplished that mission and it had been sitting on the shelf for a good while. wish it was kept that way! first, sam hell is of course not roddy piper. he is replaced by a dude with a large face, less charisma, and this poor actor is very soft-spoken for the part! sam hell is supposed to be rebellious and awesome. here, he gets captured three times! what kind of a hero is that?! spangle is replaced as well here by another actress. why did we not get different characters here? this was stupid! lou ferrigno stars in this film and he is not even the hero. common sense says let lou be the hero of the film! bad effects, poor acting, and just a forgettable film. funny as they take shots at ninja turtles 2 with the whole concert scene in this movie. at least ninja turtles 2 was funny and not a bad movie! i really wanted to like return to frogtown, but i just cringed when the fight scenes would commence. this film makes turtles 3 look like gold! avoid this or you will be the one singing "meaner, greener, talking turtle tv dinner!"

the monster will look very familiar to you. so will the rest of the film, if you've seen a half-dozen of these teenagers-trapped-in-the-woods movies. okay, so they're not teenagers, this time, but they may as well be. three couples decide it might be a good idea to check out a nearly-abandoned ghost town, in hopes of finding the gold that people were killed over a scant century-and-a-half before. you'd think that with a title like "miner's massacre" some interesting things might happen. they don't. in fact, only about 1/10 of the film actually takes place in the mine. i had envisioned teams of terrified miners scampering for their lives in the cavernous confines of their workplace, praying that black lung disease would get them before the grim reaper exacted his grisly revenge, but instead i got terrestrial twenty-somethings fornicating--and, in one case, defecating--in the woods, a gang of morons with a collective i.q. that would have difficulty pulling a plastic ring out of a box of cracker jacks, much less a buried treasure from an abandoned mine. no suspense, no scares, and a couple of embarrassing performances. somebody forgot to tell the writers that "fool's gold" refers to the genuineness of the gold, not the people who are looking for it. 3/10

director and fx man john carl buechler doesn't have to do much in order to terrify me; the sight of his name in the credits alone is enough to strike fear into my heart.his lamentable straight-to-video output in the 80s sat on the bottom shelf of the horror section at my local rental shop; twenty years later, and his dvds occupy the same space. it seems that the more things change, the more they stay the same. you can rely on old jcb to serve up dreck, whatever the format and regardless of advances in movie-making technology.in this contemptible offering, a bunch of friends travel to a remote town where they discover the secret treasure hoard of jeremiah stone, aka the forty-nineran evil, claim-jumping, cannibalistic miner who caused havoc in the mid-1800s. before his death, jeremiah cursed anyone who should find his gold, and it's not long before the pick-axe wielding killer is back, bumping off the hapless treasure seekers.with its dreadful script, unimpressive make-up effects and scooby-doo style villain, 'the curse of the forty-niner' is par for the course for buechler. only genre stalwarts keren black, richard lynch and john phillip law lend this movie any credibility whatsoever, with the rest of the cast giving performances ranging from bad to awful (although i'll forgive alexandra ford, who is a complete hottie).even fans of bad schlock horror will be disappointed since most of the women keep their clothes on, and a lot of the deaths occur off-screen (which is probably not such a bad thing since the on-screen deaths are pathetic).'the curse of the forty-niner' is another in a long list of duds for john carl.

this was bad enough. i really hope that there is no sequel. maybe that is giving away part of the plot to let you know that it is open to the possibility, but no, it really isn't.there is really not at all special about this movie. well, the special effect were fairly good, but nothing to write home about.there were some hot babes in her, especially elina madison and alexandra ford, but nothing to see folks. pg-13, definitely not an r. that also tells you the slasher aspects were less than spectacular. the shovel to the head was the only thing that was unusual.tame scare fare.

a group of friends receive word from a pal who has found gold in an old mind shaft nearby an ancient abandoned western town of suttersville. despite warnings by the local sheriff, murphy(john phillip law), old man prichard(richard lynch)a bedraggled hick who swindles tourists with supposed collectible wanted posters, and kooky superstitious aunt nelly(karen black)to stay out of the mine due to it's notorious legend(..that an evil coal miner who sold his soul to devil and murdered a priest's(jeff conaway)daughter will return from the dead to kill those who remove the gold from his shaft), these people only see the green, not the blood red which could potentially ooze from their slain bodies. finding the gold of jeremiah stone intact, they line their pockets and carrying cases, prepared for the bright futures that supposedly lie ahead. but, when you do not heed the warnings of those you consider backwoods loons, the obvious result will be gruesome death. jeremiah stone, as we see, is lying merely a skeleton near an alter containing skulls lined next to each other as the candles on top of them light up, the pickax underneath awaiting it's master, with dust particles returning him to a grotesque corpse with demonic exposition, his eyes aglow with wrath. this hapless group, hoping for some fun around the campfire with gold providing them with warm prospects for life ahead, will fall prey to the vengeful ghoul and his mean pickax. another victim will meet the nasty end of a shovel thrown through the windshield of her vehicle, directing it's path straight into her neck. another failed attempt to retreat has stone causing a frightened victim to drive his car into a tree, his body engulfed in flames as he fails to escape without harm. another, a local girl searching for her new friends, worried about their well being, receives the pickax buried into her stomach. aunt nelly informs those still alive about the forty-niner and the curse on those who raids his eternal stash..and pays the price for relating such information. will anybody survive? or, is the entire group fated to perish at the hands of the zombie miner?make-up effects artist and monster creator, john carl buechler directs this supernatural slasher without worrying about logic or strong story-telling, opting instead to allow his zombie miner to destroy anyone and everyone who happens to be in his path. he provides just enough back story, and this is feeble at best, for the killer allowing special guest star, karen black(..oh how her career has sunken into the abyss)to explain to the viewer about him. the story given to us has the miner holding a priest's daughter hostage, threatening to execute her as the suttersville authorities warn against such an action. startling enough, stone plants that pickax right into her back, with the opposition unloading their guns with little effect because he sold his soul to satan. retreating to his domain, the mine shaft, stone sends out a warning against anyone even attempting to take what's his, the loot. typical of most slashers in general, this bunch of twenty-somethings are your garden variety victims, with little development other than some banter and exchanging of words provides as filler until the undead maniac pops onto the scene to slaughter them. they are the usual group, from the city, trespassing unto unfamiliar territory, resurrecting an evil that should remain dormant. like many of the later 80's slashers, a good deal of the violence is off-screen. what is on screen, the minimal gore, is rather mundanely presented and happens rather quickly. the ghoul make-up for the killer is only shown occasionally;he's mostly shrouded in darkness, the victims' horrified faces as he catches or chases after them are given more credence than the method of destruction. one thing's for certain, stunt men were set on fire many times. at least three times, a character is burned alive by either a lantern or flaming vehicle. martin cove has a minor cameo as black's former husband, caleb, now living with a much younger, and dense, honey. vernon wells(..of the road warrior and commando fame)has the back story role of jeremiah stone as a human, still capturing the same type of menace he specializes in. john phillip law seems to be enjoying himself as the rather polite and hospitable sheriff, welcoming the outsiders to his neck of the woods. buechler has quite an attractive cast of actresses, all wearing tight pants and smallish shirts, showing off their sleek and athletic figures, especially elina madison as easy-lay roxann, always willing to remove her clothes for greedy jerk, hayden(rick majeske). stephen wastell(the ghosts of edendale) is axl, a rather clumsy foil, used as a butt of many jokes including his "dump in the woods" scene and current unemployment status.

seen this one in a sneak preview yesterday and must say it was terrible. after the credits i thought: "hey with this cast it'll probably be pretty good". didn't at all turn out that way. lame predictable groaners, terribly simply drawn characters (maybe except a little ms. lara's) and an ending one could foresee 10 minutes into the movie. and worst of all, it misused a delicate theme (handicapped persons) for low level and mostly tasteless jokes without ever touching anything but the surface of the issue. the handicapped person the film sympathises with the most is the one who is just faking it. what kind of message is that? and the film doesn't have a thought through ending at all, it basically comes down to: "i love you, doesn't matter that you acted like a prick."to sum it up: great cast that must have been terribly bored to sign up for a terrible flick.

alexandra maria lara: a very beautiful and enticing woman, but not a good actress. in all the films i've seen her in, she appears to me as the exact same character. whether it be in the downfall, nackt, vom suchen und finden der liebe and now wo ist fred! she always is (plays?) the young, good-hearted woman, who is a little naive and doesn't know how to handle the things happening to her. she disposes of a repertoire of probably five different facial expressions that she works with abundantly. i personally have a hard time believing that she could play a mysterious and slightly obnoxious character because it just isn't in here. so she's typecast as the nice girl next door, which she is, but, once again, she ain't up to snuff when it comes to acting. til schweiger: same thing! the film: downright stupid. as it was an american movie it would have been a great role for adam sandler who i don't like either. i wasn't offended by the fact that this is a film with handicapped people in it, i just thought that the jokes resulting from this weren't funny at all. i chuckled twice or three times but when i was halfway through it, i was just bored and annoyed and wanted this flick to end.

be very afraid of anyone who likes this film. they probably inhaled too many paint chips as a child. its so awful i refuse to relive a plot. o yeah, there wasn't one! this movie is a true definition of what hollywood creates for people who don't want to think at a theatre. do the bad guys win? do the good guys win? who cares!

this movie is absolutely terrible... definately a bull***t story and even worse acting. too bad charlie sheen is involved in something like this since he is a decent actor and has done a couple of really good movies.the special effects are 'a-team'-standard with the classical car gets shot and then flips over with a little fireball under the hood.of course the enemy are portrayed as total idiots and die as fast as they can say '-die evil americans'.unless braindead movies are you game, don't spend 113minutes of your life on this rubbish. pick up 'the platoon' or 'apocalypse now' instead.

only saw this movie late last night. i remember the hype of it's release and to be honest had i viewed it back then i maybe wouldn't have been so generous. i hate hype, it can ruin a movie. i think the movie glossed over the characters and put too much emphasis on woody. he was good too - although kept wondering if he was stoned the whole time. it never went too deep. redford was dark but not too dark and his character let me down in the end. to me he should have been more confrontational with demi - throwing her out perhaps or telling her that she was paid for. after all he would have investigated them before he made the proposal - that's not shown in the movie, but no one in his perceived position would have made an offer to just anyone. he was cruel to the point of breaking them up and the last straw was the house and yet demi fell for him? the passages giving an insight to demi and woody's relationship were the best part of the movie. there was a keen deepness that outshone the shallowness of john gages character. he really could have been a lot stronger and as other people have alluded i think the movies draw-card was redford and they didn't want tarnish his "image". i say what the hell robert was old in this movie! woody and demi's characters were naive in a sense, but i think that was very intentional to draw you to their plight and champion their decision. but the reality is, they were losing their dream home and where did they go? las vegas? to gamble what little they had left and then accept a proposal from an insanely rich billionaire. i found their naivety when redford was seducing them a little too unrealistic. the movie could have been so much more and other actors would have made a difference, but having said that on late night tv - it was enjoyable and i if you don't think too much - also palatable

demi and woody are married, but they're poor. they meet robert redford, and he's really rich. he takes a fancy to demi, and since he's a gambling man he makes the couple an "indecent proposal:" one million dollars for a night with the little woman.at this point you need watch no more of the film because you can put the details together in your sleep. of course demi is going to accept the offer. if she doesn't there's no first half of the movie. of course it will affect demi and woody's marriage. if it doesn't there's no second half of the movie. and of course everything will turn out okay by the time the credits roll. if it doesn't, there's no happy ending for the sake of box office.the absolute best thing you can say about indecent proposal is that demi moore looks good in a black dress. as for the rest... the script is incompetent, the direction amateurish, the performances negligible. i suspect redford, moore, and harrelson blush and change the subject every time the film is mentioned. do them--and more importantly yourself--a favor. unless some one offers you a million... miss it!gary f. taylor, aka gft, amazon reviewer

spoilers throughout:not good. the movie differed completely from the book(not that the book was exactly a classic but it really was very good.)i guess demi moore was ok. actually, i don't really remember to much about her performance one way or the other. however the big disappointment wasn't with ms. moore.why did whoever did the rewrite decide to suddenly make the millionaire have a heart? (i'm referring to him as "the millionaire" because he also had a different name in the movie then the book version-just another change.)people who didn't read the book obviously won't know anything's different but in the book version this guy is much more ruthless as well as complex overall. he is also fascinating. the fact that such a big change was made in the movie alters the whole plot. it was almost like seeing a completely different movie.i know many movies vary widely from the books. but i also thought redford's character was a bit of a wimp. this isn't redford's fault(he's a great actor and could have played ruthless well) but without those qualities he becomes just another dazzled man in love hence the story becomes just another cliché love story involving 1 woman and 2 men. that wasn't really the point of the book.this could have been a lot better. even if i hadn't read the book version i wouldn't have liked this all that much, but changing so much around definitely takes it, for me, a few points down.

this movie received a great write up in blockbusters 'coming attraction' i was looking forward to the release date,08/07/02. the plot sounds reasonable, the cast alone should have guaranteed a side-splitter, but whoa there; apart from the 'off the wall betting events' this was quite a bore.this will never become a comedy classic, and i'm afraid it has done no help to the fine comedy reputation of john cleese. rowan atkinson, now he was quite funny, in a rowan atkinson sort of way!

if you are a fan of slap-stick that has terrible writing, awful acting and cliche after cliche this one is for you. there is far too much to list for the reasons why this movie sucks. in a brief synopsis, people with a combined iq of 100 journey to new mexico on a race for 200 million dollars. and yes they are all apparently super heroes, as they can do many things such as jump onto trains that are traveling 80+ mph, survive numerous car crashes, and endless instances of outright cartoonish roadrunner and coyote antics. if you are a teen, or dont want to think for a movie, this one is for you.. not one actor outside of lovitz is believeable at all.. lovitz saves the movie from a 1 with the hitler bit. 2/10 (save yourself the 2 hours of pain and $4)

astroesque (2 outta 5 stars)i have no idea what the title is supposed... even less of an idea of what is supposed to be going on in this movie half the time... yet, it still kept me sort of interested. this is low, low budget film-making along the lines of "el mariachi", filmed in 16mm... and, for what it's worth, the shots are very well-composed and visually stylish. directed, written by and starring comic book writer/artist michael allred... i guess it's no surprise that the film looks good. unfortunately, some of the acting is beyond bad... and the rest is competent at best. allred himself comes off the best... but only because he doesn't actually speak much. he just strides around looking cool most of the time... or running from crazed rednecks who are trying to kill him. the sound is also pretty bad... almost as if it was unfinished in places... maybe they couldn't afford to pay for the music they'd planned to use? strange, vaguely science-fictiony plot... similar in tone to "the man who fell to earth"... but most of the film boils down to a standard run-from-the-bad-guys and kill-them-before-they-kill-you plot. ultimately too oblique to be successful but not without interest for adventurous movie watchers.

this film coincides with mike allred's comic book mini-series, "red rocket seven" and tells the story of an alien who escaped to earth to wait for "astroesque" which ties into the book of revelations and the apocylpse. this is only part of a bigger story (if the movie confuses you, read "rr7" too). you can easily tell that allred is used to telling stories with pictures. the direction is very good and the effects aren't bad for a $500 budget. unfortunately, mike used many friends to play the roles and probably didn't have the heart to say that they couldn't act. also, mike is not showing his writing skills in this movie. his dialouge spoon-feeds the plot to you and doesn't let you enjoy the characters. this was actually disappointing considering his tremendous writing ability shown in his comic books. 4 out of 10.

this film is little more than an ersatz verhoeven. the filming is supposed to be tele-realistic, but is simply sickening. the parody disappears after about 15 minutes to be replaced by a story which seems to take itself seriously. the brechtian pauses for non-existent advert brakes are tedious, and even painful; undoubtedly there was no actual intention to render this film brechtian, it was just an accident which happened like that. if you want to see a parody of reality tv, watch celebrity deathmatch - it's funnier and wittier, and most importantly shorter. i have rarely felt so much pain whilst watching a film. to be avoided like a rabid rabbit.

i saw this film last night, a satire of the reality style programs that seem to be making the rounds at the moment.what can i say. i absolutely hated it. about as interesting as watching paint dry and with maybe one or two only slightly amusing moments.maybe it had something to do with me definately not being a fan of the survivor and big brother type shows, but if this had been a video/dvd or if i'd been watching at the cinema on my own i would have definately not endured more than the first 5 minutes.

the people who came up with this are sick and twisted freaks how the hell can you exploit people like this? tricking people into thinking that this is real? which i probably don't doubt that it is... i saw this thing for the very first time today series 7 and it made me sick to my stomach i almost threw up. i just couldn't stop crying my eyes out for these poor people and if that woman really did have that baby you should all be ashamed of yourselves!!!!!!!!!! i have a 4 month old daughter and it is just absolutely appalling that would put a "real" pregnant woman in so much fricken danger! you people are bloody animals and should be locked up for life allowing something like this to put on t.v. if this so called "reallity show" is for real then why isn't anyone being put in prison for allowing people to die and not doing a god damn thing about it. you all deserve to be friggen hunted down!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

i turned this off about 50 minutes into it! whoever the moron was who decided to steal the idea of koushun takami's book(battle royal), & make it into a pathetic reality tv show scenario, deserves to be shot!it has done the film industry a good turn though. now directors like william malone(fear dot com) can say "well at least it's better than series 7" this piece of crap & dracula 3000 tie for first place in the worst 100 movies ever made! be warned this is not a 'so bad it's good'flick!this is a disgrace to film makers everywhere! never see this movie!

despite the potentially fascinating premise, series 7 is weak attempt at attacking reality television. aside from its bargain basement production values, which present an eyesore 10 minutes in, the overall tone of the film is misguided. several reviewers have attacked the acting in the film, but i think the real problem is this lame attempt to make the film into a farce. aside from the fact that the jokes are not funny (a pregnant woman swears a lot, a young girl gets a bunch of guns), it doesn't gel with the overall tone of the film. had the makers actually made series 7 to bear a striking resemblance to actual reality tv-colorful yet hollow edits, lame sound effects, sweeping camera motions-maybe their point would have been more solid or at least more palatable. instead series 7 meanders through the already harried world of death and game show. you can just imagine the director slapping himself on the back for stating the obvious

do not waste your money or time. terrible movie. bad acting, plot all over the place. really, really bad acting. man, this movie is just plain bad. i shut it off at 7 minutes. the script is bad, the directing is bad, it seems to me that a high school group got together to do a project for their drama class. yes, it's that bad. the acting is not convincing at all, mind you i saw only 7 minutes of it. how this movie made it to dvd, is beyond me. it should have been left in the editing storage room. i saw the cover and thought it was pretty cool, i sure's heck won't do that next time :_)

let's see, cardboard characters like muslim terrorists have forced a cardboard scientist to perform some exotic drug tests on some cardboard people who have been drugged and kidnapped. you'll be sure to laugh when these pathetic excuses for humanoids get their just deserts! turns out the drug experiments have given them the ability to sense another world....the world of religious fantasy!--complete with cardboard demons who look like they are made of papier mache. everybody gets dragged off to hell except for one poor chap who goes to heaven where he can presumably spend eternity with the blockheads that created this masterpiece of the absurd. i think i'd opt for hellfire myself. go see something else, unless you are stoned, in which case, you might actually like it! couldn't hurt!

evil behind you, was created for a specific purpose in mind, to shove the writer/directors personal views on who either gets to walk on water or who gets to dance with the devil. sadly it would seem that the creators were so focused on making their point that they took it's power away completely by force feeding their point to the viewer.the way its message is presented almost reminds me of the stories i've heard of the spanish inquisition! from one real christian to another, avoid this like the plague, fear tactics never work when trying to send this kind of message!!the acting was horrible,the selection of muslim terrorists was racist and unfair(they're terrorists so they must be muslims). the premise of this was good, the story provided a great conduit for its message, however it was the execution of these ideas that fell short making it very difficult to even separate the message from the messenger so to speak.you'd be better off dusting off your old "ghost" dvd with mr swayze to better receive this message. at least that movie didn't try to shove itself down your throat. or if you like good christian movies with a powerful message, try "end of the spear"

i gave this movie a four-star rating for a few reasons. first, i felt that this movie was definitely preaching and i hate that. still, it's my own fault for watching a christian movie in the first place.my friend and i rented this movie because it sounded interesting. the back of the case said something along the lines of a spiritual battle, someone opening some sort of boundary that let demons into our world and the like. something i am very interested in, indeed. this movie almost hit the target. it was more like on the edge of the target, more on the tree than the target itself...the basic plot of this movie is two couples are abducted by a group of terrorists to be victim to experiments. however, because their experimental serum is derived from the research of a scientist who claimed to be able to bridge the gap between the physical and the spiritual realms, the men of the couples are now able to feel, smell, hear, and see the demons of the spiritual world. in that order. apparently the sense of taste is not present in that realm.this movie is very clichéd. they took the title seriously as the men, while chained to the beds, demand their women look behind them because there is something there.although a good effort for what it was, i think the special effects could have been done so much better. the demon scratching at the woman was, in a word, hilarious. the wife was obnoxious as hell and everyone in the room practically cheered when she died. we were all hoping she'd be beaten by the other woman with the chair, though.the message is one that i don't care to comment on, other than i think the christian filmmakers should have found a better medium for it.and so i give it four stars because it is not the movie's fault i am not a christian and don't like this type of message, and i got a kick out of making comments throughout. my friend and i watching this movie seemed to resemble an episode of mst3k.

this movie probably began with a good idea but that's as far as it went. when i read the cover at blockbuster i thought it had promise but that was based on the overall idea for the movie. the movie began with a professor talking about how in the future we will be able to see creatures from other dimensions. there was no explanation of how that would happen but that's okay i thought it would be developed that in the movie. it wasn't. in the next scene we see two young men lying on tables with tubes taped to their heads. beside each one are two attractive women. the men begin asking "do you hear that" or "do you see them". we conclude they think they are seeing ghosts or some other creature that seem invisible or they are hallucinating. the women do not see these creatures. this was fine for the first five minutes but this scene goes on for a full hour. it is briefly punctuated by flashbacks that have no correlation to the so called "plot" of the film. we are also introduced to a man in a lab coat and what appear to be middle eastern terrorists. what is this about? we never find out. the flash backs lead us to believe that the terrorists are forcing the man in the lab coat to perform diabolical experiments on these young people but we never understand why. at the end of the movie the terrorists finally do what terrorists do  they blow up the lab, but why? what is the point? we have no idea. this film contains so many disconnected thoughts and ideas that there are too many to enumerate but one more notable one is that fact that the man in the lab coats and the terrorist pop in and out of the room throughout the movie and not once do the young men attempt to escape or even leave the tables on which they are laying even though they are not strapped down! the makers of the movie also bring in cameo appearances by cockroaches on several occasions but again we never learn what that has to do with the storyline. sorry but this movie was a waste of $4 and the time i spent driving to the rental store and then watching it. take my advice. don't rent it.

i would have given this less than a 1 rating if it were possible. the entire film should have been left on the cutting-room floor. what a pathetic waste of time, money and effort! let's see...assemble the prettiest cast you can find (which of course is in direct proportion to the amount of talent they lack)...throw together the thinnest plot you can dig up...and viola! an abominable piece of trash that the director and/or producer should be ashamed to put their name on. how much worse can the horror genre get? and don't use "low budget" as an excuse...i have seen many great low-budget films....in fact some of the best horror classics of all time were low-budget. if you don't have the talent and ingenuity to make a good horror film, then for god's sake don't make one at all!!!

i normally love jackie chan movies but this one was terrible. there are only 2 or 3 fight scenes all of which are up to normal standard more or less. the bad thing about this movie is it focuses a lot on car chasing/racing. the car chase isn't so bad (though not as exciting as fighting) but the car racing at the end is exceptionally boring. basically it takes all of things that make a jackie chan film a jackie chan film and leaves out everything except jackie chan. even the traditional outtakes at the end lack their usual humour.i suppose to a certain extent it was made worse by the fact i saw one of those horrible dubbed versions. i usually try to see the subtitled version...i wish i could understand chinese.i've only seen one jackie film worse that this one and that was one of his early forays into hollywood films that didn't turn out so well.avoid unless really curious or a lover of motor sports.

my only question is: why did they make this movie? did they have a script or did they make it up as they went along? boom boom doesn't look like a charley davis. john garfield probably turned over in his grave if he saw this.

after the suicide of his father, charlie 'kid' davis (ray `boom boom' mancini) accepts the invitation and advice of his friend tiny (michael chiklis) and travels to las vegas with him trying to become a boxer. on the road, they meet gina (jennifer beals) hitchhiking, they give a lift to her and she becomes charlie's girlfriend. johnny ticotin (rod steiger) is convinced by tiny to be charlie's couch, and the powerful agent alex dumas (joe mantegna), after watching him fighting, becomes his manager, promoting charlie's career. this movie is so boring that it indeed does not deserve to spend much time writing about it. i do not like boxing, but sometimes i watch some worthwhile movie about this theme. but this one is horrible! predictable, full of clichés, having an awful lead actor, a pure waste of time. my vote is three.title (brazil): `corpo e alma' (`body and soul')

the original body and soul (1947) is a masterpiece. john garfield, ann revere, lilli plmer, william conrad, canada lee...and filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screen..james wong howe. this remake is abominable. in spite of the presence of rod steiger, joe mantegna and jennifer beals there is nothing of value here and it is a shame this product bears the same title as the brilliant original. only the main character's name, charlie davis, is the same in both films. i don't think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake. i am amazed that rod steiger participated. this may be the only bad film he ever made. maybe he needed the paycheck.

according to "lucien rebatet" in his "histoire de la musique" (robert lafont, bouquins 1973 page 338) beethoven's character was not very compatible with women. he had quite a number of "platonic passions" with female members of the "vienese aristocracy" to whom he dedicated some "sonatas". but musicians , even composers did not qualify for husbands of "fine ladies". haydn was a "servant" of prinz von esterhazy, mozart died from drink or poison and bethoven was according to rebatet a frequent customer of "street prostitutes" in vienna. a british biographer, newman says that beethoven contracted syphilis, before he was 40. that he became deaf because of that, is possible, but not certain.the ninth symphony was premiered on may 7, 1824 in the kärntnertortheater in vienna, along with the consecration of the house overture and the first three parts of the missa solemnis. this was the composer's first on-stage appearance in twelve years; the hall was packed. although the performance was directed by michael umlauf the theater's kapellmeister, beethoven shared the stage with him quiet.so what remains of this "female fantasy". ed harris interpretation and characterization are quite good, but too linear, based on the painting by ferninand waldmüller date 1823. i have it in front of me. it shows a man that despises (perhaps hates) the world. with good reason.

am i the only person who saw and remembers amadeus. every scene in "copying" has its counterpart in the milos forman, amadeus - from the galloping carriages accompanied by frenzied strings, to the entrance of anna through the dark hallway preceded by the man with the key, to the very dialog of the conclusion with anna at beethoven's feet a la salieri before the dying mozart. does no one else recall the dialog in that script: salieri "time?" , mozart "common time". ....."we begin with the strings..." and so it "copies".remember cynthia nixon leaning against a door jamb, tears falling down her freckled face - same scene, just replace her with beethoven's nephew. even the scatological humor (fart jokes) are the same. we even have a cardinal followed around by a plate of sweet cookies which recalls salieri in the banquet hall. does no one else remember? !!!!and the scene where anna cries to god "why did you give me this gift?"... salieri said the same thing!and beyond all that we have a juvenile script with an opening exposition that reads like the character identifications you'd find in a children's story. "i am mr. beethoven. i am the composer...."and what, after all, is the purpose of the bridge builder? other than to juxtapose the technical against the artistic... a comparison that is not at all developed - probably because it has no meaning, especially when it comes to beethove who was a master of the technical.there's only one great scene - the playing of the ninth. first, the music, which of itself takes you to tears. but then, there is the highly erotic interaction of anna the copyist keeping time and beethoven conducting which surpasses the most explicit sexual intimacy. so intense, it's almost embarrassing.but, please - the rest of the film - where is the world's collective memory? you have seen this all before .... and better!

from kreestos: the dialog is terrible, awful, drivel. acting poor. many plot flaws. i don't recommend this at all.from wikipedia:artistic licenses the working manuscript of the score is attributed to two copyists [1], both of whom were male, not female as depicted in the film.the copyists neither contributed to nor altered the score. in fact, they were berated by beethoven for any deviation that occurred from the original score.the movie is set in 1824 during the composition of beethoven's ninth symphony. throughout the movie beethoven is shown to be hard of hearing but quite capable of understanding people who speak loudly. in reality, beethoven had lost much of his hearing seven years earlier (1817). beethoven never experienced permanent deafness; his condition fluctuated between total silence and terrible tinnitus. the ninth symphony was composed at a time when beethoven's hearing had deteriorated severely. at this point in his life, most of beethoven's conversations were facilitated by the use of notebooks. it can be argued, however, that he was also able to read people's lips, evidenced by his insistence that people face him when they spoke to him.in the film, beethoven makes an allusion to the moonlight sonata. this is an anachronism as the sonata no. 14 "quasi una fantasia" was not named "moonlight" until several years after his death.

i can't help but be completely annoyed by this sitcom. it's like they didn't even bothered trying ro write good comedy, just rehash third rate jokes and hope it sticks. the worst of all this is that it's all so damm uninteresting and lacking in every way.to make things worse leading man kevin james has a permanent "i'm so funny" smug grin on his face that would be tolerable if only he once delivered in the comedy department, which he doesn't, he just lies there doing nothing like a big unfunny baby. which takes me to the relationship between the heffernan's- easily the most insincere and poor representation of a married couple on any tv show, really headache inducingly obnoxious remini spends the whole show as if it where a violent chore to even be around her own husband. jerry stiller yanking the few laughs on the show is doing a 100% repetition of his role as frank costanza in seinfeld only this time his hints mostly tread on water due to the inability of the central duo in recognizing a joke even if it flew by them. the episodes just drift along in a stream of nothingness, their jobs add nothing and their interaction is even worse.this is not even a waste of talent, there is no talent here, this is a laughless creative desert.

this is a lame comedy.here's why: a man and wife sitcom. okay.the husband is a douche bag. the wife is the einstein.how original is that? jerry stiller is just the same guy on seinfeld.the gags are lame. no witty one-liners.i have had enough. stop this now.the last word: stupid. the destruction of the average white guy continues on abc. the worst part? kevin james is actually a funny comedian. he just isn't here. leah remini is great eye candy, but is unlikeable. wasted talent is the word. bad sitcom.

a show about an incredibly dumb, man-child and his shrewish hot wife. 99% of the plots revolves around doug doing something unbelievably stupid and then comes a variable: a) either he hides it from his wife or b) tell his wife, she emasculates him and then it's up to the father-in-law (arthur: the typecast character from seinfeld) to aggravate the situation.and the writers dare to say it was influenced by the "honeymooners" (an absolute classic) and that the plots are drawn from real-life situations, unless you live in a cave, you know that's not true.anyway, let's just put it this way. if kevin james had been thin, the show would have got canceled fromm the pilot. if you're 12, or you're fond of fat jokes.. be my guest, watch this show (or any of kevin james movies for that matter).i've noticed some posters compare this travesty to much superior shows like friends, seinfeld and everybody loves raymond -- i'm still wondering how could anyone do that

this show uses a rather tired sitcom formula of the fat idiot blue collar slob with the pretty (and sometimes shrewish-seeming) wife and crazy in-law(s). with this show, it's fat unfunny comedian kevin james as doug hefferman who works as a delivery driver for a parcel service. he has a pretty wife, carrie (leah remini), who works as legal assistant, and senile father-in-law, arthur spooner (jerry stiller), who lives in his daughter and son-in-law's basement. kevin james' doug is your typical beer drinking, sports loving, tv watching slob of a sitcom husband who would rather watch the tube than deal with his marital issues. he also has a couple of idiot friends who lend extra stupidity to the problems encountered by this show's couple. beyond the few laughs supplied by jerry stiller's crazy old man character this show was generally unfunny. kevin james' imbecilic behavior usually caused the show's problems that usually resolved by his wife. this show continued a run of sitcoms with the fat stupid father/husband and their pretty wives that all seemed to run on abc for some reason.

i am very diplomatic in my reviews, and as an academic writer, try to give creative license to tv writers trying to explicate a true story. this story, about karen carpenter, could have helped so many, yet due to the directing and editing, does not.the story, in this case, is not fully addressed, unless one reads psychological journals. while cynthia gibb portrays a realistic karen, it is sad that so much has been edited...louise fletcher portrays her mother, and does an excellent job, with limited material and dialogue. in this case, i give the actors credit for surviving this project.why is the audience not permitted to see causation factors?....american audiences are quite savvy, and if they have cable, usually educated.i sincerely feel that i could have written a better story, would not have edited out the truth, and allowed the actors to project the reality.richard carpenter, as director, has seriously underestimated and insulted american audiences. karen's story is important, and it is sad we will never hear it.

i have been a fan of the carpenters for a long time, read the biography, watched the specials, and saw the karen carpenter story. this movie really didn't show the real karen carpenter. in the movie she seems to be a shy and a pretty much of loner (except for one girl friend). the real karen carpenter was much different. she was outgoing and friendly. she had lots of friends, especially olive newton-john. the movie doesn't even show karen's attempts for a solo album and her meeting phil ramone and his wife itchy "karen". itchy knew the real karen carpenter in new york. when karen was in new york, she did see a psychologist, but it was voluntary and once a day and then she would leave to go to her hotel room. also, karen was taking pills to increase her thyroid, so she could loss weight, but stop taking them because the psychologist recommended her not too. also, the karen's husband in the movie is named bob knight, but in real life was named tom burris. also, karen wasn't divorced from tom, but only separated. karen was to sign the divorce papers on the day she died. also, agnes found karen naked in the closet unciousness, unlike in the movie where she was dressed in white. the music was very good. that was the only thing i would recommend on seeing it.

i've become a big fan of the carpenters, and i didn't really enjoy this movie.i feel it focused far too much on her anorexia and didn't let her true personality shine through. i wasn't overly fond of cynthia gibb's portrayal; especially knowing she decided karen's anorexia was suicide, which it clearly wasn't. although her family was not big on hugs and kisses, i thought the movie portrayed agnes (their mother) as being terrible.i did find a few scenes to be harrowing in a way, such as where she sees herself in a mirror that seems to distort her and make her look heavier; i thought the metaphor (so-to-speak) there was rather effective. when the family is playing pool and discussing her divorce and she breaks down and richard is shocked when he comforts her and feels her frail body was pretty moving (which is probably the wrong word) as well.overall, i feel they needed to bring out her more bubbly, quirky side--her genuine personality. even as the focus of the film, there really wasn't a point that caused one to understand what would lead her to anorexia (though of course no one can really know), and almost made it seem baseless. the film was more poor-singer-with-anorexia than karen carpenter's story, in my opinion.i would assume that they changed her husband's name/profession and all because they couldn't get his permission to actually include him (there were some bad terms there), but that whole aspect was inaccurate with the changes. on this note, i can't recall the movie bringing out her longing for a family and kids, which greatly prevailed in her life and explains her whirlwind romance and quick marriage to her husband.on the whole, it ends up as a low-budget made-for-tv movie that just isn't very high quality and can be disappointing if you're a hardcore fan who is hoping to see beyond karen's disease. i feel that such a legend deserves/deserved a better film as a tribute to an amazing person and an awesome voice.

i spotted the dvd on a store near my home, and since i'm a "cheesy horror movie/alien flicks" addict, i wondered how good it was. it even had two award mentions on the cover (i don't remember what festival it won) so i figured "hey this might be good". so i bought it (for five euros) and i came here to imdb to check out some reviews. here, either people bashed the movie to say it was bad, or people said the movie was a wonderful feat in indie movies bla, bla. i then played the dvd, not thinking about any review i had read, with an open mind, and not expecting anything at all.man... i don't' like being this critical, but the movie was genuinely bad... ok, i'm just going to give out some pointers of what i thought:1-acting/dialog: the acting was so confusing... sometimes the actors did a decent job, but there were scenes were i could spot no effort at all from them! the dialog was even worst... i think it was probably the aspect i most disliked in the whole movie. the talking in between characters seemed... off. not just bad, but far away from the actual happenings in the movie. the monologues of the female character, although well delivered, became boring and annoying in a little while... but of course the most ridiculous aspect was the... "aliens" or the "infected"... i wont even comment on that one, just going to say that it was absolutely ridiculous and took the entire mood away from the picture; 2-visuals: the strongest aspect in the movie... if you forget the awful fx and light flashes they used to simulate explosions or what the hell they were supposed to be. the "camera in car" aspect was quite cool actually, but they didn't even used the environment to inspire fear or dread. they left that to cheap sound and video fx and the three "infected" characters. the movie becomes boring in so many scenes...; 3-sound: talk about editing... this movie has no problems in showing how weakly edited it was. from computer sounds imitating the forest animals to the "alien dialog"... ah...so what did i like in the movie... (spoilers) the only thing i really liked and it was actually quite scary was the succession of two scenes where the car is still and you spot something/someone walking in a distant. at first i really thought it was me seeing things, but when the character realizes that the "figures" coming towards her were her own reflection, i was surprised! pretty creepy idea done well! apart from that... i had an awful time.and i don't recommend this to anyone... not even "teen get together" because you can't even laugh at this...i give it a solid 2. only some technical achievements worked here... apart from that... yeah... nothing

army private gene kelly, who's also a talented trapeze aerialist, comes under fire for doing daring stunts without a net and alienating his high-wire cohorts; meanwhile, there's an elaborate 'camp show' to put on for army soldiers and personnel, and the whole studio of m-g-m has shown up to join in the fun. mickey rooney plays m.c. (unctuously), introducing acts like kay kyser and his orchestra, bob crosby, benny carter, and the m-g-m dancing girls (who appear to be dressed as vegetables). red skelton does a cute bit with donna reed and margaret o'brien, but the other comedic bits suffer from an apparent vacuum between the performers and the allegedly-live audience (they're awfully silent until the editor cuts to them for exaggerated reaction shots). judy garland sings an inappropriate song about a jumpin' night at carnegie hall (improbably accompanied by classical pianist josé iturbi, whom judy calls 'hep'). the production is glossy, but the manic energy feels false, fabricated. ** from ****

jumpin' butterballs, this movie stinks! it's a dull and listless drag that never lets up. it's a wonder anyone even bothered to make groucho up in his bizarre trademark eyebrows and mustache, as he has nothing witty or outrageous to do or say throughout this bore. chico must have been so disinterested that he forgot to use his italian accent.only harpo provides a grin or two, and there's precious little of that to go around here anyway. figure in a loudmouthed hotel manager and another obnoxious co-comic in frank albertson, and the road gets even bumpier. a real misfire.

picking this up along with the rest of the marx brothers box set, i found myself disappointed by most everything beyond a night at the opera. this stinker is prolly the worst i've seen of them so far, with the clever lines left out and the characterization is woeful. the playwright is so obscenely stupid in this play it's hard not to tackle the television and try and strangle him.as it is, the marxes seem to do better as outsiders brought in to wreak havoc, and are much much better when they have a good gag or two at least. the material here is all obviously written for anyone, and it really wastes the marx's talent. avoid. rating: 3/10

this film is likely to be a real letdown unless you understand the circumstances under which it was made. the marxes were chosen to be cast in the film version of a play that was not originally written for them. they are sort of force-fitted into the roles. ironically it might have been funnier if it had used different actors who did not have such high expectations placed upon them. instead, it has been forever enshrined as part of a canon to which it really doesn't deserve to belong.

************* spoilers below ************* "'night, mother" is the story of jesse (sissy spacek), a divorced epileptic woman who calmly announces to her brash mother (anne bancroft) that she's going to commit suicide. this is a fascinating premise that is drained of all vitality and excitement. the brilliant hook turns out to be a cheat- the story that follows is lacking in substance, gravity and revelatory value. where are the shocks and surprises as mother and daughter have what may be the last conversation of their lives? where are the secrets revealed, the confessions and fantasies and regrets? they're here, but they've all been painted the same dull color that keeps emotion in the background and celebrates the 'genius' of playwright marsha norman at the expense of everything else. the result is not a film but an exhausting endurance test.let me preface my comments by saying i find sissy spacek to be one of the greatest actresses in the history of motion pictures, a woman so magnetic, so natural that she continues to surprise and amaze me after twenty years of stardom. she brings a touch of class and magic to everything she does, and i've seen her rescue more than one film from the recycling bin with her angelic face and vulnerable eyes, her soft voice and sweet smile. it was because of the great spacek that i watched this film in the first place, and for one of her movies to be terrible it has to fail in a significant way. this film fails in two.first and foremost the film is adapted so faithfully from the pulitzer-winning stage play that it is claustrophobic and repetitive. the entire movie is a two-woman dialogue between jesse and her mother. what worked on stage- a middle-aged mother and daughter argue for two hours in small house- dies on film. a play, no matter how great, needs to be *adapted* for the screen it is self-indulgent and arrogant to believe that the dialogue is so perfect that not of a word of it can be altered. the screenplay for this film could have been shortened by thirty to forty pages, and a knowing screenwriter would have given the brilliant spacek and competent bancroft some *physical* sequences, some facial reactions, something to break up the wall-to-wall yak fest and prison-like single-set. it is no wonder that the screenplay was adapted by the original playwright marsha norman, who may know theater but reveals herself here to be clueless in film.i cannot over-emphasize the effect the stage-play script has on the film. watching jesse and her mother argue about jesse's impending suicide is redundant and dull. the women walk from the living room into the kitchen into the den and back into the living room, where they start all over again. a tiny midwestern house is not the ideal location for a single-set film, and the director never tries anything clever or original, never tries to break up the monotony with an exterior shot or cutaway or a flashback or *anything*. there's no music, no other characters, no other stories... just two women covering the couch cushions and arguing their opinions. the reverence given to the play is sickening even shakespeare's most solemn classics get shaken up for the screen. the commitment to the original play seems almost spiteful it's as if the film was made only to document the dramatic treasure that was the stage play, with the audience an afterthought.the other reason the film fails is anne bancroft. she may be a good stage actress but on film- where presence is 80% of performance- she rarely seems to fit. she certainly doesn't fit here, playing a midwestern grandmother but looking more like mrs. robinson before her morning coffee. she chases jesse around the house, looking more aggravated than astounded, and seems extraordinarily unsympathetic, even when her lines convey a loving- if flawed- woman.sissy spacek is great as she always is, honest and open and so good that you actually understand and agree with her character's choice. sissy lets us see that jesse is a flat tire, a wrong turn of a woman who has had every bad break and made too many wrong choices. she's never had control of her life, and her suicide will be her way of finally saying "no more- this is where i get off." that's how she puts it anyway, and when spacek speaks you listen. she proves in all her films that a good actress doesn't have to behave like a man, doesn't have to be all bluff and bravado and borrowed testosterone. in this and in films like "coal miner's daughter" she quietly demonstrates a soft strength and quiet depth that is as impressive as it is hypnotic you can't help but fall in love.that's why it was so hard for me to watch "'night, mother." spacek is wasted in a stilted stunt of a film that never serves to engage or even distract. i would not recommend this movie to anyone except die-hard fans of sissy like myself and even then you'll be disappointed. i do give the film an entire letter grade bonus for the ending, which is courageous enough to let the lead character do what's right for *her* and not pander to a hackneyed happy ending. grade: c

hey ....i really do not know why this film has been appreciated so much,perhaps i missed the point.the way i see it , a lot of international film makers have made brilliant films that have dealt with 'schizophrenia' and have informed ,excited ,shocked,evoked emotion and compelled the audience to step aside from their own reality and think.........while it is true that aparna sen's endeavor was an ambitious one ,in light of all the other movies , this one falls short..... miserably......it was too slow, there were no details about anything and the ending .... was completely ...pointless......it was not open ended or anything ....just pointless.....so watch it if you want to see a good concept completely wasted.......

i had the privilege of seeing this powerful play on broadway with kathy bates in the lead. i only saw one other play in the 1970's-1990's that had an emotional impact like this play did. i really looked forward to the play being made into a movie but was very disappointed when i learned that kathy bates wouldn't reprise her role in the film--she wasn't well known off broadway at the time and the producers must have wanted star power i suppose and cast sissy spacek instead. sissy did an adequate job in the lead role but did not measure up to kathy bates in any way. i love anne bancroft but she seemed too young for this role. the movie plot was true to the play. anyone who ever contemplates suicide should have to watch this movie to realize the devastation on those who are left behind.

i like the concept of csi, but the show is spoiled by some seriously wooden acting. the medical examiner has the best lines and delivers them in an arch, offhand manner that livens up the story. unfortunately he has little screen time.also, why does jorja fox always look and act so utterly unhappy? i know that forensic investigation is a very serious business, but the characters, for the most part, seem to confuse seriousness with humorlessness and a complete lack of personality. i can't imagine dating either sarah sidle or catherine willows; what would you talk to either one about? i'm waiting for the episode when, at the end of a shift, catherine picks up a remote control, points it at grissom, shuts him down, and wheels him into a closet until the next day.

my ratings: acting - 3/10 suspense - 2/10 character attachment - 1/10 plot - 2/10 character development - 2/10 overall - 2/10this show sucks very much officially. for me, csi miami is the best, csi ny 2nd and csi 100th. i don't know, in the other csis you get into the episode you're watching. but in this one, you just can't get into the episode, no matter how much you try, so in my opinion, this show is not worth watching. i know people have different opinions, and i respect that, but for me, this csi ain't good enough. so if you like suspense, real acting/performance, good plot, direction, character development/attachment and you an overall good show, i suggest you to watch csi miami.

one: your screen will be filled with beautiful effects and colours. these do nothing for the story, but they will keep your lazy eyes occupied for some 50 minutes. a good example is the eternal use of a computer screen that shows each fingerprint from the database as that print is compared with the one they want to find out about. yeah, right.two: these guys being like real professional pros, they will engage each other in intriguing pro talk: "look, grissom, these are what we call fingerprints. everybody has them, and they are different on each person. so, with these fingerprints we can actually find...".yup! exactly like real pros would talk to each other if there wasn't a completely uninformed and stupid audience around.however, not everything about this show is bad. some stories work to some degree, and the colours _are_ really beautiful. they use red, blue, green, yellow... all of them colours i've loved since kindergarten.

what exactly is the point of pretending to "con" people out of things like ski passes and pizza? i fail to see a point. i'd not clever or original and it strikes me as being extremely pointless. skyler stone doesn't seem to be a very down-to-earth or even a nice guy. he has very little charisma and just about anyone could do what he does in this show. the worse thing about this piece of crap, is the fact that a lot of the phone calls are reenacted, so not only are they apparently conning the poor people on the other end of the phone, but they are also conning the audience who don't have enough time to read the "disclaimed" that flickers across the screen for about half a second at the beginning at the end of the show!not only that but he also claims this is how he lives his whole life. what an lie. no one could live their lives like this and the fact he says this is not only yet another con to get his show watched, but it's also one of the most fabricated, blatant pieces of bull$hit i've ever heard. this guy is an @$$!what makes them think that going to all the trouble of, for example, write and record a song, get someone to pain a huge picture of you and two mates, get dance lessons and actually travel to a ski resort is actually worth only getting free ski passes and some food for free? what is the point of that? it's an awful lot of trouble to go to just for a few ski passes and a bit of snow. as far as "comedy" goes, this is bottom of the barrel stuff.

i have decided to flush this show from my memory down the toilet of bad tv show into the obscurity of forgetful, disappointing, pointless, garbage tv show hell.the skyler guy who is the host/star/creator of this show is boring, uninteresting, unbelievable, not particularly good looking and not at all funny, in short why is this guy on tv and especially why is he in a comedy show when he's not funny, pretending to be a professional con man when he definitely is nothing but an obvious pretender? others have said it here already but this guy is a total fake and fraud, if you believe any of these cons i think you should seriously consider going to get your head checked because they're all fake, and the ones that might possibly be true are so pointless, like spending all day to con someone out of giving you an average meal at a restaurant? seriously this guy needs to go away, glad this show got canned.

on top of the fact that skylar is a complete douche bag and his cons are unimaginative, his schemes require way to much preparation to make any of his scams worth while. without giving away any spoilers (as if it matters with this piece of crap) his cons are such a sham because it takes the effort of days and days of planning, and the use of multiple accomplices and an entire camera crew etc. just to scam someone into a service that would cost less than a hundred bucks.....in addition if you read in the credits they re-stage some of the phone calls etc. because they don't pan out...the whole concept of this show is bunk because all of his cons have the cost in both the crew and the effort of ten times the actual cost of the service he is trying to get for free...what is the con?

scarier than any horror movie ever made because you're in controlled of this blood fest which make it more scarier than watching other people doing it on the big screen or on your television screen. this game got two cds which make the game much more entertaining.each cd contains a different character with a complete different story line which make the game much more fun. i recommend you to buy this game and the first game too (isn't as good as this game, still fun though)****

my overall feeling about this film is that it was a slow, drawn-out, structureless wander through some of the worlds genuinely unfortunate situations with a bit of redemption and an obvious message. the film is composed mostly of fairly uninteresting video footage of the countries he visits with bad reenactments, all slow-mo'ed down to a snails pace and overlaid with depressing music. certainly some of the materials and interviews contain some compelling stories, but unlike what the description on the back suggests, it wasn't so much the victim's story that's being told as it is the director's, mr. ripper, and he doesn't tell it well. this film could have included longer, better interviews with the people themselves, letting them tell their stories. instead mr. ripper indulgently draws the story towards himself making it some kind of personal journey, and unfortunately it doesn't end up being much of one. i never really got a sense of any growth as he explores the subject, and he never indicates what about the subject pulled him in in the first place. he just drags us from one place to the next, brushes lightly on the situation and characters, hangs around showing too much uneventful slow-motion footage of people just walking around the streets, then moves on to his next destination. he does this over, and over, and over again without any real development. i felt like this film could have been cut down to 45 minutes but it's drawn out to close to 2 crushingly slow hours. we feel morally obliged to care about the topic, but the director's self-indulgent, meandering, uninspired delivery of his journey makes you grow numb after a while.

but then again, what ever is? i picked this up at my local 99cent store for, you guessed it, 99 cents (plus tax). i remember seeing this on video as a teen and thinking it was a cool flick. too bad the film and my memories don't match. regardless, its not a too horrible way to blow a couple hours, and it is neat to see some vintage bill paxton and mark hamill. blah.... blah.... blah.... man, oh man, i cannot think of anything else to say about this flick... (just filling space to meet the ten line rule...) good golly, this is pathetic, just how bad is this movie that the best i could come up with in regards to it were five frickin'lines of text? so anyway, ten lines of text, eh? hmmm, ten lines are hard to come by when you can't remember squat about a film you just watched.

this is a film that really makes me cringe. in 1951, mgm and looney toons were making some of their very best cartoons--with amazing animation, exceptional backgrounds and great stories. then, in the late 40s, a new style of animation began to appear (such as the "crusader rabbit" series on tv)--animation with extremely simplistic artwork in order to save money. unfortunately, columbia picture's cynical ploy worked!! instead of the public hating the toons (as they should have), many accepted them and the oscar people (ampas) actually gave this film the award for best animated short--giving legitimacy for an inferior product. unfortunately, in the dollars and sense world of hollywood, this soon began to creep into the products of legitimate studios--resulting in rather crappy cartoons. later, it got even worse as in addition to lousy animation and backgrounds, the stories themselves became almost unbearable for adults to watch. the cleverness and style of the classic cartoons were gone. and for this tragedy, i blame, in part, gerald mcboing-boing--one of the granddaddies of cheap cartoons. the story isn't that bad but the animation is a horror and listening to the kid saying "boing-boing" incessantly is a pain.

awful wot more can i say i remember seeing it in the cinema (see how it sticks painfully in the memory)as a 16 yr old lad. mark hamill was the older generations skywalker and wasn't great at that, he was worse in this. plus a dour soundtrack by then jericho aaaaarrrrrrgggggghhhhhh. there is one film equally as bad as this i saw in the cinema arthur 2 on the rocks. funny how that question "what is the worst film you have ever seen is?" is easier than "what is the best film?" which incidentally varies between the italian job (original), untouchables, casino, things to do in denver, goodfellas (getting a sense of what i like??? - this will fool you!) finding nemo, pirates of the caribbean and moulin rouge! please never watch this film or it will stick in your memory too!

i saw this film when it first came out in the cinema. we were all looking forward to seeing mark hamill relaunch his career, but we came out wishing we hadn't bothered. many people walked out after about half an hour - i wish i had too. the basic premise seems okay, but the plot was ridiculously involved and tortuous, and runs out half way through. its completely unmemorable, and not a film you want to have paid money to see. if you're really bored and it's on tv, then it'll help you kill a couple of hours (or help you to nod off!). 2/10

the film has so much potential which was not developed. mark hamill gives a good performance and so does bill paxton. the scenery is beautiful and the ultralight aircraft are neat. the problem with this film is that the story is way underdeveloped and the plot goes nowhere. the film at certain points almost puts you to sleep. i give it 3 out of 10 stars for the flying scenes.

wow !! i didn't even know about this movie until i was searching for the name of another mark hamill classic (time runner). some things are better left unknown. mark hamill's role is quite ... limited. i would compare his appearance in this movie to all those appearances of vincent price and christopher lee in those bad horror b-movies of the 60's and 70's. in those movies, they appeared in the the first and last 5 minutes of the movie. memorable acting by mark with such great lines as "don't try to run. you're under arrest." did i mention he says that exact thing more than once. bill paxton fell into an uzumaki type spiral of drugs and booze after aliens, because he ended up in this movie after waking up on the set after a binge session. the hair .. the hair !!! .. priceless bill. truly should have been "game over" for bill .. but somehow .. he got treatment .. and went on to better??? movies. this movie blows. it is more dull and boring than the crazies. at least that movie was crazy... this is just boring. do not watch this movie sober.

yeeee-haa! i have seen it argued that most american movies are cowboy movies in disguise; that hollywood is so in love with it's only truly original creation that it keeps reinventing the cowboy myth. i'm not sure i totally buy that argument but slipstream is evidence in support of the theory; it's a cowboy movie with aeroplanes. actually it goes one better than that. it's a spagetti western with aeroplanes! substitute the planes with horses, make the android a priest and this movie would be indistinguishable from any one of a dozen italian spanish semi-arty "shoot-'em-ups with pretensions" of the seventies.the film isn't as bad as i had been lead to believe by some of the reviews i had read here but it certainly wasn't good.

combine good casting, bad writing, good orchestral scoring, bad dialogue, and good story idea with lots of potential but is never realized then you have slipstream. just bought the movie for a buck, it is worth it, but not much more. good to see mark hamill act again. there should be a decent sequel made to remedy the damage from the original. or at least give it the proper attention it should have received in the first place. berstein's score gave demanded your attention from the opening credits, however, the long shots of slipstream planes and the even longer revealing of interesting plot points mutes his attention getting score. it is really easy to dog a movie like this, after all it is by the producer of starwars and the director of tron and a tremendous cast but it is what it is. and that ain't much.favorite line- "we're going to make it, ha-ha!...(boom!)"

the quote above just about says it all for "slipstream". i should have bailed out of this film after the first half hour, but decided i ought to be fair and give it a chance. i won't watch it again, so if anyone with the temerity to do so can get back to me with the number of clichéd lines in the movie, i'm sure it will set a record.some otherwise fine and talented actors got mixed up with this clunker; mark hamill portrays a futuristic bounty hunter and bill paxton is his quarry. paxton's character has hijacked hamill's prisoner, an android taking his name from the poet byron (bob peck). tasker (hamill) shoots owens (paxton) with a dart containing a tracking device so he and his companion belitski (kitty aldridge) can keep tabs on the pair. the real question though is why didn't he just fire the device at byron thereby cutting out the middleman.if you enjoy scene after disjointed scene with tedious characterization and artsy fartsy pretense, then i suppose you'll find something of interest here. but you can't convince me that the film makes sense on any level. scenes of a futuristic stone age make way for high society snobbery, but the pinnacle of poor taste is reached when paxton's character is displayed following a night of revelry with hickeys all over his torso. if anyone thinks there's some hidden meaning here, you're really stretching.patiently waiting for the frame proclaiming "the end" to come into view, alas, even that was denied. if beauty is in the eye of the beholder, then so is understanding; this movie had neither. yet there was a single redeeming feature as the closing credits began their run - an awesome view of a half dozen hot air balloons. apparently the film was keeping them afloat.

the story and the characters really really needed work. the world idea is kind of neat, but no one bothered to develop any of it either through exposition, or through the plot. despite the cheesy notes at the beginning of the film, it makes sense that you wouldn't use exposition, since no one is new to this world. and yet, when matt owens (bill paxton) and byron (bob peck) stray off-course and get lost, and get introduced to the wind-worshipers and the fat, lazy, rich people in the museum, we don't get any real idea of who these people are, or why we should care about any of them. smart films have ways of developing this simply by having the characters live in the world. simple things, like ordering a drink at a bar, or talking about something in the past -- these are the kind of things that make the film world memorable, not endless shots of crappy planes, and cheap cg effects of someone trying to do loops in an ultralight.if this is too difficult for you, here's a little tip -- pare down the multiple locations. if everything's becoming disjointed because you're pulling up to often, stay in one place for a little while and have the characters talk a little. all the superfluous crap should be removed. get rid of the entire wind-worshipers scene. get rid of the stuffy museum people. get rid of all the crappy flying crap unless you can make the wind relevant to the story. have the entire thing set on a big plane, or something. just get people talking about something we care about.hey, get rid of bill paxton. have the film center around tasker's character and his relationship with the robot, byron.indeed, the biggest problem of the film is that we don't care anything about anybody, because no one takes the time to either explain their motivations or delve into their characters. we don't like matt (well, because he's played by bill paxton, among other things). he's a scoundrel, who doesn't redeem himself enough, except to let the android, byron, go. and this action has even less meaning than most because of three key points: 1. byron is a murderer. 2. byron is indestructible 3. byron can leave any time he damn well pleases.we try to like byron, because there's a kind of pathos there, but it's largely undeveloped. all we're left with is a whiny, glassy-eyed robot guy who's acting is subdued and wooden one moment, and practically zany the next. we don't know why or how he develops emotions, but we do know for a fact that he's murdered someone. we don't know why he murdered someone, or the circumstances of this grisly event, because it isn't developed. we can't feel pity for him if we don't know the story. all we know for a fact is that he murders people. and he likes bill paxton.we don't hate tasker enough (partly because he's played by good-guy mark hamill), since while gruff and ruthless, doesn't do anything out of the ordinary for his character -- a post-apocalyptic peace officer. sure he kills montclaire (robbie coltrane) and his team, but they are drug dealers, on their way to grow poppies for heroin. and they shoot at him first. he doesn't kill anyone who doesn't get in the way, or who does not try to physically harm him first. that goes equally well for the final confrontation in the museum. he uses a smidge of police brutality against a lazy dilettante (f. murray abraham is wasted in this role), and everyone else draws a gun on him.i really don't understand what's the deal with belitski (kitty aldridge), tasker's partner. after only an accumulated 10 minutes with matt, she's ready to switch sides, despite her shouts of loyalty, and despite matt's trash-talking her, and punching her out. if that's love, then i'll choose hate any day.really. paxton's character is about as lovable as simon in "true lies", or pvt. hudson from "aliens". does anyone fall for him in these movies? no. why? because he's a loud-mouthed idiot, and a loser. why put him at the helm of this film?

this film fails on many many levels. the script is the first failing, and as i understand it, if the script stinks, there's nothing that can fix that. the plot is boring, after the first 45 minutes, i'm looking at the counter on the dvd saying to myself, "how much longer?" the cinematography is pretty awful. i'm not sure how bad the transfer was to dvd, but it looked like a vhs copy. also, the sound was bad. i realize this isn't going to get remixed for 5.1, but yikes, it didn't even sound like it was in dolby stereo which had been around for almost a decade when they cut this film.slipstream was far too similar to both mad max and blade runner for comfort. because of the lack of decent special effects and high quality dialog, it is extremely disappointing. if i recall, the pointer scene took place during the last 20 minutes, usually it should take place in the first 20. most people will be totally confused as to what the heck is going on until the final 20 minutes.the film's music was excellent in parts, and then completely inappropriate in others. elmer bernstien did the scoring, but it sounds like someone else had a hand in sticking in 'other' stuff elsewhere as it doesn't match the overall good orchestral score (with some synthesizer music.)there were great actors cast, bob peck, mark hamill, ben kingsley, bill paxton. and they did a great job breathing the little available life into their characters. (well, paxton's character was pretty stupid, and the whole movie was centered on him. i'm not sure a heroic stooge is a good choice for the main character who carries the film.) again, a major flaw with the script.thank goodness i watched this from a mail order dvd service, and not the theater. overall a major disappointment for sci-fi fans, or fans of paxton, or hamill. 90 minutes of your life, you'll never get back.

this movie was strange mainly because the plot was so incoherent. the title refers to a vicious wind which renders the surface of the earth almost uninhabitable when it blows, but this seemed to have nothing whatsoever to do with what was going on. the movie seems to be an extremely poor rip-off of bladerunner ie rogue android being chased by bounty hunter(or ruthless cop in this). luke skywalker turns in a surprisingly good performance as afore-mentioned rogue cop. nothing seems to be resolved at the end of the movie, we never find out anything of any substance about the android or what his intentions are. there is one baffling scene where bill paxton(who has kidnapped the android) plays one particular song in his cardboard airplane for no particular reason(the song is called "shape of things", by the yardbirds). this happens again in a later scene where the same song is played for no apparent reason. does this song have any relevance to the movie? don't think so.

with several name actors (lance henrikson, david warner, joe don baker), why was jeffery combs given the lead? henrikson would have been a perfect fit for the lead, as would warner, baker or even others in the movie such as charles napier. combs was miscast in this, and did a poor job of it. everything he did seemed fake or contrived.the script is poor. meaning that if lance henrikson (or another) had the lead role, he might have saved the film (removed it from my "waste of time" category), but it still would have been a bad movie. the screen play was completely lacking. the director should have recognized this and helped the movie along.

if you are having trouble sleeping or just want to take that nap in the afternoon but just can't seem to drift off, pop in this movie. the only neat thing about this movie are the electric planes. aside from that prepare for some sweet zzzzz's. it boggles the mind how big name stars such as those in this movie can be part of the one of the dullest movies i've ever seen. now, if you will excuse me, i will finish my nap.

this is a movie with a wonderful concept, but very weak writing. it should never have been released with out at least three more re-writes (assuming it got any). the story is too loosly held together, and there are too many 90 degree turns in the story to make it a cohesive movie. it would be great to see what a decent screen-writer could do with the story.

they say david duchovny took six days to write the script for this movie. that sounds about right.this movie is one of the worst films i've ever seen and i've seen gigli. it's not as bad as gigli, but that's like saying saddam hussein wasn't as bad as adolf hitler.tom warshaw has been living in france with his french wife and 13-year old son. he has been pretending to be french all this time. he reveals to his wife that he is actually american. for some reason, this comes as an earth-shattering reveal for her, despite the fact that she always commented on her husband's american accent. also, their son - remember, he was born in france and never knew his father was american - speaks perfect american english without a hint of french accent. that's just one of several huge plot holes in this movie.the main bulk of the movie is a flashback to tommy's youth in new york city during the 1970's, as he explains to his wife why he has been hiding in france. his best friend as a boy was pappas, a retarded adult played terribly by robin williams. i assume duchovny thinks that "retarded" is someone who is just sort of dumb, because pappas comes off only mildly slow at times, while other times he comes off as just robin williams. yes, williams actually fits in his tired improv schtick although he is supposed to play a person who is mentally slow.tommy's mother, played by duchovny's wife tea leoni, is a pill-popping nurse who is distraught over the recent death of her husband. leoni does a good job, but she mainly just smokes a lot and yells at tommy for things that don't seem to be too important. the script didn't give her much to work with. tommy also befriends a lady (whom he calls "lady") who is in prison and offers him advice through her jail window (this house of detention is called "house of d" for short, thus the title). tommy has no qualms yelling his personal problems out loud on a city street so this incarcerated felon can offer him advice, and he does so many times without care.i don't want to bore you with the entire summary of the movie, but plot holes are abound in this film that tries way too hard to be touching but comes off as, well, bad. real bad. real real bad. near the end of this train wreck, the script gets cornier and cornier and ends with a laughably crappy ending.critics tore "house of d" apart and rightfully so. i can't believe some people actually like this movie. it is a painful film to sit through and i felt weak afterwards - not from emotion, but from how terrible it was.

an american boy goes to paris after his mother commits suicide, becomes and artist and then discovers himself and returns to the states so he can make things right with his former friends.i have to think that the people who are rating this movie so highly are all x-files fans, even though there are no aliens or serial killers in it. don't be fooled, this movie blows chunks.the story is incoherent, with little or no explanation of what people are doing or why. when you do get an explanation, it doesn't fit the story that went before it. what it does is bore you. for all the acting talent in the film, it just isn't interesting. i spent the whole movie wondering when sex-addict duchovny was going to bang someone. maybe he was doing it behind the scenes; they should have filmed that instead.what comes across is a story of a self-obsessed artist worrying about minor incidents in his life and wanting to make them right somehow - even though they didn't seem that wrong to begin with. there aren't any particularly interesting or shocking revelations, despite the mention of a big secret in the first few minutes. it's just a guy thinking that his life is as interesting to you as it is to him. it's not.i saw in the trivia that duchovny claims he wrote the script in a week, that's entirely believable. the guy can act, there's no doubt, but writing and directing are obviously beyond his talents.why hollywood keeps greenlighting these self-discovery stories is beyond me. i discover myself in the shower every morning but i don't bother making a movie about it. mine would probably be better than this one, though; at least there would be some nudity.

'felony' is a b-movie. no doubt about it.of course, if you take a look at the cast lineup you might have some high hopes for its entertainment potential. this film is stuffed with all of those wonderful character actors that you grew up with, the ones with the faces you immediately recognize even though you probably don't know their names. it's amazing that the filmmakers were able to get all of these people together on one project, almost like they decided to do a b-movie actor reunion. the cast even includes a couple of really first-rate actors: david warner, who most people will recognize from 'titanic' (although my favorite of his roles is jack the ripper in 'time after time') and lance henriksen, who many will remember as bishop in 'aliens'. these two actors have done some excellent work in their long careers and made some very fine films.however, as impressive as this collection of actors is, their talent is never fully manifested on the screen. the writers of 'felony' spent a lot of money to assemble a dream-team cast and then missed their golden opportunity because of one important factor, the common denominator of all b-movies: a silly script.we start with a silly premise. the bad guys are caught on tape committing a gruesome murder and they relentlessly pursue the film crew in order to acquire the videotape and destroy the evidence. but honestly, why bother? in the time it takes them to track down the film crew, a thousand copies of that tape could be made and circulated to every law enforcement agency and media outlet. the criminals don't seem to realize how futile their effort is, and they talk as if stealing and destroying the one original videotape is going to solve the whole problem. silly...but i suppose if the bad guys were so logical there would be no movie.then there is the dialogue. it is at times silly, at times cliché, and at times unbelievable...everything you have come to expect from a b-movie. of course, i have always believed that strong performances can overcome a lot of weaknesses in the material. this cast includes actors who are definitely capable of strong performances, and although a number of the cast members are not good actors at all and have achieved b-movie status quite deservedly, one still might be hopeful that the stronger part of the cast would be able to infuse some life into their parts. however, it's disappointing to see that few of the actors in this film really seem to take the movie seriously enough to give it their best shot. there's not much inspiration evident in these performances, but then again it's an uninspiring script. now, i'll admit that some of the more colorful actors in the cast do manage to add a certain amount of pizazz into the delivery of their lines, but honestly, even the very fine actors i mentioned earlier seem mostly disinterested and uninvolved with the story.speaking of the story...even if the acting had been of a high enough caliber that it made the dialogue seem a little less cheesy, it still would not redeem 'felony' from the fact that its writer commits the ultimate faux pas of low budget action movie scripts: a plot with as many holes as a block of swiss cheese. you can watch this movie a hundred times and you still won't figure out how everything adds up. in an effort to create suspense and always keep the viewer guessing, the writer throws in all kinds of surprises and unexpected twists into his script and ends up with a jigsaw puzzle, but when you get to the end you find there are a bunch of pieces that just don't fit anywhere and others that are missing. i admire a good thriller that keeps me guessing, but creating plot twists that exist just to confuse you and which are not consistent with the rest of the story is amateurish. there was so much that was never explained that i felt extremely frustrated at the end. if you decide to watch it, be prepared to be confused.i haven't even mentioned all kinds of other silly things about this movie, but i won't bother. the funny thing is that despite everything i've said, i have to admit that i can't give 'felony' 1/10 stars. although i can't exactly put my finger on why, i actually found this film to be somewhat likable. the silliness can actually be fun at times if you are in the mood for it. plus, i really like some of these character actors, and even though their performances are somewhat lackluster considering their talents, i still got a kick out of seeing them.now, i realize i have been rating this film from the standpoint of a serious moviegoer. it's entirely possible i have completely missed the point. it could be that the filmmakers' intention all along was to make a b-movie. maybe the silliness is all completely intentional. if that's the case, and if i were to rate it on those terms, i would have to say that 'felony' is a classic in the genre of tongue-in-cheek action flicks. b-movie fans will love seeing all of their favorite actors together in one film, will get some chuckles from the script, and will be entertained by the healthy dose of guns, explosions, and chases.

lance henriksen has a knack for being the top name in a b-movie, even in this case starring along side charles napier, master control program, and joe don baker. as always he does a great job of being the bad guy, but the plot is just bad (don't even get me started about the ending). and the editing is so horrible it might actually be a thing of beauty. is it just me, or does it seem that joe don baker was spliced into the movie at the last minute? also, anytime glass is broken in this movie, the editing is so anti-phenomenal. lastly, after watching this, i figure david warner is dying for tron 2.0 to finally get the green light.unfortunately for felony, this will be the third movie i give the rating of 1/10, joining iron eagle iv and no mercy.

one of the worst things a film studio can do is exploit the tragedies of others, commercializing a 'shock' or 'gore' factor in order to sell tickets to be able to buy their birch a new diamond necklace. another worst thing is to totally misrepresent the true facts of an incredible saga by fabricating events, dialog and images to the director's own liking. lastly, one of the worst things a film studio can do is to use bottom-of-the-barrel actors and shoot it all on a sound stage that was rented for fifty cents a day. all three of these travesties the makers of this film are guilty of. this is, hands-down, the worst movie i have ever seen, and i've seen thousands. a score of '1' is too good for this waste of celluloid. not only should the filmmakers be ashamed for making it, they should be ashamed for negatively exploiting the heroes of this story, which are the people who experienced this tragedy firsthand, both the living and the dead.

i couldn't. i was bored, not just because the acting was terrible and the tragic story was simply a b-movie whose plot was all about the cannibalism, but the fact i was watching a subtitle foreign film, which doesn't bother me at all, but was still dubbed.the "special effects" were awful. as the back of the plane splits off, you can see the model is hollow as it "breaks away" in the phony snow. most of the movie takes place on a sound stage that clearly is not real and almost looks like a play, as the "sounds" of snow blowing all over are heard but not actually scene."but how what will they eat? they have no food" one military person (it's never clear what this guy does or why he's in charge) says, which i'm sure no one ever said in reality or even thought about food, since they were concerned if the people were alive, not how they'd eat. it was simply a stupid line written to point out that, yes, they will have to eat the dead bodies to survive.when they finally decide to eat the bodies, one man finds one shirtless body, who despite being in the snow for however long, is not remotely frozen, in fact, his flesh is very flexible and fresh. he cuts the fresh meat off his back, that again, is not frozen or even cold it appears, and this scene goes on for five minutes. that's where i had to stop. the remake "alive" was a far superior film about trying to survive in a horrible situation that i'm sure the real survivors praised whereas i can't imagine any of them had anything nice to say about this version. it was simply about eating dead bodies and everything else was secondary. avoid.

making a film based on a true story, particularly one as incredible and horrifying as the 1972 andean plane crash, is hard for even the best filmmakers. but the mexicans behind this forgettable and cheap exploitation flick don't even try! the actual names of both the survivors and the casualties of the uruguayan air force plane crash have all been altered, the crash itself is obviously staged in a very slip-shod manner, and the cannibalism aspect has been unnecessarily and gorily played up. shockingly, it made a ton of money on both sides of the border. thankfully, thought, it has mercifully been forgotten. but the same people behind this would later give us the equally revolting guyana: cult of the damned!this cheap horror exploitation flick necessitated the making of alive some fifteen years later. that film was a masterpiece. survive!, to put it mildly, is not.

leave ed wood alone. to call "plan 9 from outer space" the worst film ever made would be to deny this abysmally vulgar heap of hollywood guano its rightful title. this pretentious fusion of witless whimsy and bathetic sociopolitical "commentary" actually does seem to be formed along the lines of "plan 9," with badly-staged scenes of down-on-their-luck actors on cheap sets interspersed with what appears to be footage of battle and crowd scenes cribbed from higher-budget epics. but whereas "plan 9" occasionally manages to be funny when it means to be and reasonably entertaining overall, this tacky pageant is appallingly lacking in basic showmanship, with scenes ranging from offensively unfunny (the disgusting burlesque of groucho marx stealing manhattan from the indians) to low camp (hedy lamarr attempting to impersonate joan of arc hearing her "voices") to tedious (dennis hopper doing absolutely nothing with the role of napoleon) to the unexpectedly poignant performance of peter lorre as the psychotic nero. give the worst director trophy to irwin allen, for turning so much into so little.

i'm an atheist. to me history and truth mean a lot.this film is made after a novel published in 1921, which is still being updated up to this day as if it was a history book. well it's not. the movie is about the novels 1950s version. some actors were great but that doesn't cover the plot.in short man invents a super-bomb so god and his friends hold a tribunal to see if they must intervene. the devil analogy persecutes man, and for defense we have the spirit of man. what is the spirit of man anyway? and why was the first defendant adam? eventually you just get us christian propaganda in a 5th grade history book of the time. though other religions are mentioned, only european christianity is explored.first we get the caveman story. the women are scrawny stereotypes of damsels in distress. real cave women were as strong as men and just as resistant. hard times, hard life, adapt and survive. all this is watered down by mid-century stereotypes.next we get egypt's first pyramid construction. today we see a different story and know that there were a lot less deaths and regular citizens at work as well. loosing mentioned amount of many lives in the process would have been a national disaster and nobody after would try to beat it. as if there was only one pyramid build.the part about moses and one true god was as if the spanish inquisition was asking nicely. inquisition itself was never even mentioned in the movie.helen of troy's evil grim was so vile that i didn't see why so many were even interested in her. in reality they were just soldiers, following commanders orders, who were "discussing" a political issue of power. she was just an excuse.the cleopatra story was were i saw this film was to inaccurate and filled with propaganda. here brother was a lot younger. she was not obsessed with poison, was quite educated to restore library content, and was politically competitive to drag beaten down egypt out of dirt.the part with nero and praying christians in a cave were disgusting. yes, rome burned down. yes, there was persecuted christianity. but the way they portray it was as if the coliseum build itself and there was no vespasian to rebuild rome.attila the hun appears in a short seen and than we jump to king arthur. the crusades are mentioned with minimal bloodshed. and there is no mention of the crusades east to russia that ended in an ironic battle. the knights just went home and started jousting for fun of it. a lot of stuff is put down like no indoor pluming, hygiene and plagues.then they cover joan of ark, where she always has to much makeup and looks like a princes. territorial politics were replaced with an unjust court. the sidesaddle alone on a stool makes me want to ask how someone could follow here. at here burning i wanted to yell "hura! now die already! cheap special effects, where is the fire?".by the time they mentioned leonardo i already got fed up with the movie. columbus, spanish slaughter of america, yelling queen elisabeth "kick the spanish armada" and so on and so on.the only reason i wanted to see this movie was the fact that it was the last one with all 3 marks brothers. and all they got was the scene with manhattan and indians. amusing, but no more than a smile.the witch-hunts are mentioned briefly, as well as plagues (after renascence). when they start portraying revolutions, things gut power-hungry and anarchistic. the us revolution was pursued by the french revolution. oppression and incompetence are bad, but you can't just blow the old way up out of anger, you must replace it with something. so they replaced the french monarchy with new french monarchy. so we get napoleon and his ambitions to go to india by land. but they replace his motives with unity and band him for only the title "emperor". the conquests in europe, defeat in russia are sacked to waterloo.the us civil war, the english rich inventors (tesla not included). "mister watson, come here, i want you" almost made me laugh for teenage reasons. technological hard work was watered down to the final discovery and comedic misuse.eventually after 85 minutes we come to world wars and organized crime, but none of its horrors. adolph's words "i invade russia. this is my last territorial demand" were hilarious. it was his last territorial demand.to build suspense god puts a countdown clock to doomsday on the "wall" for the final words. all mighty cant pause the universe for a second? there was no need for the persecution speech but the defense made one last throw.last we see the man of tomorrow as the final defense. apparently a paradox man, because the bomb was to go of today. his toys are a music box in the shape of a gun and a pencil box sword. now that is so wrong pens and pencils drew so many weapon blueprints that its kill count surpasses the atom bomb. and making music out of a weapon? deluded egoistic generals make music out of weapon fire. so the man of tomorrow is already a monster.the way i see it, all the defense had to do was blame the devil as the true conspirator for mans demise and case closed. and honestly, compared to all barbaric stuff our ancestors did centuries ago we are pretty humane at painless backstabbing these days.to summarize all i will just quote "firefly"s episode "jaynestown": "it's my estimation that every man ever got a statue made of him was one kind of son of bitch or another. ain't about you, jayne. it's about what they need".

i can't understand why many seem to hate this.this movie ties together many of the overlapping settings of the historical and biblical epics of the fifties, using set pieces, props, and costumes similar to those seen in other movies. here, however, the story attempts to run through all of human history, with a frame story about the human race being on trial, with a guilty verdict meaning h-bombs will go off all over the world. the prosecutor is the devil, played with fiendish glee by vincent price. ok, so it's a little hokey calling the defender "the spirit of all men," but i think that's one of the things that gives this movie a sense of period charm. the spririt of man is incidentally played quite well by ronald coleman, in his last film. it is also the last movie in which groucho, harpo, and chico marx all appear, but not together. groucho plays peiter minuet buying manhattan from the indians, in a scene played purely for campy humor. chico isn't funny at all as a monk who thinks the world is flat, and harpo, we are told, is meant to be isaac newton, discovering gravity. most of the other performances are well done, though.other hokey things are that the trial is supposedly taking place in outer space, which is depicted as a region of clouds and blueness. there is something called "the great clock of outer space," which, when striking midnight, may signal the end of the world.but at its heart, the movie addresses the problems of wmds and the eternal question of whether man is basically good, or basically evil; and poses it in what i think is an interesting way. also, anyone who likes the look of costume epics of the fifties should like the look of this movie.

when i was 8 years old, and going through my marx brothers phase, my father read in the tv guide that they were showing the marx brothers film, "the big store" late on friday night, and set the vcr to tape it for me. when i woke up on saturday -- due no doubt to a misprint in the tv guide -- my father and i discovered "the story of mankind" had been recorded instead."the big store" was probably one of the least funny of all the marx brothers movies and nevertheless it stands as one of the century's finest works of cinema when compared with "the story of mankind." i can almost justify tv guide's error, in that the marx brothers -- groucho, chico, and harpo -- appear in both movies. although in "the story of mankind," they are divided up into a series of unrelated scenes: groucho plays peter minuit, chico plays some guy talking to christopher columbus, and harpo plays isaac newton????? harpo's scene lasts about half a minute; chico only has two or three lines; groucho's scene is at least funny, but horribly racially insensitive by today's standards. the rest of the movie doesn't bear mentioning. they trotted out some of the finest actors of the day, and made them recite total garbage. what a disappointment.tv guide, i sent you a nice letter, i'm still waiting for an apology.for the record: "the big store" has a wonderful bit of physical comedy with the marx brothers on roller skates, and a couple of songs by virginia o'brien. i was really looking forward to seeing it.

irwin allen's first venture into all star spectacle was one all star disaster. the story of mankind contains some of the most incredible casting decisions of all time. virginia mayo as the blond cleopatra, dennis hopper chewing the scenery with napoleon, peter lorre dining on the scenery for weeks as nero, marie wilson as marie antoinette as a roadshow marilyn monroe, that's just some of them.the film also is known for being the last film which featured all three of the marx brothers though they all have different roles. chico plays a monk who is christopher columbus's confidante, groucho euchres the indians out of manhattan island as peter minuit, and most astonishing of all, harpo marx as sir isaac newton who discovers gravity when an apple conks him on the bean. holding all these portrayals together is a story where mankind itself is being judged. a super h bomb is about to be discovered and let loose will do in the world's population. it's judgement day a coming.but mankind has its advocates and detractors. speaking for the prosecution is old scratch who's been bringing the worst out in man for centuries in the form of vincent price. but man has his good side as well and who better than ronald colman to demonstrate man at his most civilized best. colman and price plead their case before the judge played by cedric hardwicke. in those three individuals you have some of the finest speaking voices the english language ever knew. when the film is on them as they each bring out the exhibits for their case it's a pleasure to listen to. then when the focus is on the individual stories, you want to scream in agony.what was irwin allen driving at, i'm still trying to figure it out. was he deliberately camping it up with some of these casting decisions? if it was satire, it just doesn't get off the ground.this was ronald colman's farewell film and while it's hardly something i'd like to go out on, i can't think of any man who could have stated the case for civilization any better. so when you see the story of mankind, fast forward through some of the exhibits and treasure every moment the advocates are before the judge.

do you hear that sound? that's the sound of h.g. wells rolling over in his grave, between this version and spielberg's cinematic abortion it's been a tough year for the classic novel. but at least steven got a few things right compared to this crapperella. hello, the ships weren't big insects, they had names. they were tripods and the aliens worked in threes. the ships and the aliens were all wrong, you don't really get to see the aliens until the end. the effects and the cast work fine. but these actors are much better then this "movie" deserves. the bulk if not all the movie is the howell character wondering through the devastation, meeting one person, they join him and he looses them for one reason or the other. there's not more then two people on camera at any given moment though most of the movie. it's like if they filmed three at once it would put the movie over budget or something. so fat the only and mean only watchable adaptation of the war of the worlds story is the george pal version way back in the 1950s. the black hole.

pretty, stereotyped, good looking cast, the story loops in a wide and confusing arc, leading you down a number of garden paths (without attendant fairies) before plummeting to an end that feels you leaving - hollow.if you are after a film that has climax or ends with a satisfying thump, this is going to be a disappointment. inspite of the main character's notionally overt sexuality i felt that he was androgynous, lacking a clear male persona, rather like his lacking of a clear french persona. even though he is notionally laid naked (or rather sat naked) at the end of the film, the viewer is as unaware as the character as to motivations - that little thing called plot. probably a stereotypically english speaking point of view, at least if you take the side of the film.

l'auberge espagnole is less funny and less interesting than any episode of dobie gillis. where is their bob denver? do they even have a dwayne hickman? a french man moves to barcelona to attend classes. he moves in with some other students who are no more interesting than himself, and they do and say uninteresting things. this movie is unbelievably bland. the only bright spot was a pretty french girl who played a belgian lesbian. she places her hands behind her head and reveals shaven underarms, not the usual tufts of dark, smelly hair. but bare armpits does not a good movie make. l'emmerdeur was funny, so was la cage aux folles. l'auberge espagnole and le placard makes you wonder what is going wrong with french comedy.

i have seen previous movies from cédric klapisch, and therefore expected a quality movie with psychological depth. having been an erasmus student myself and having visited several friends studying abroad, i know very well what it means to spend some time abroad and mix with different cultures at the same time. yes, it is great fun! because of that i thought i should not miss this movie. unfortunately i was disappointed to find that l'auberge espagnol fails to satisfy in many ways: the characters are stereotyped, the events are trite and the story is shallow. although there are quite a few familiar situations, they are irritatingly cliché and do not go beyond the trivial events. this made the movie uninteresting to watch, and gave me a strong "been-there-done-that-don't-you-have-anything-to-add?" feeling. apart from that, the movie lacks a firm story. it sometimes looks more like a documentary or 'real-life' show than a seriously made movie.however, i can imagine that if you haven't studied or travelled abroad, this might be fun to watch.

i was really looking forward to seeing this movie, having spent a few (fantastic) college weeks in barcelona myself. the premise is right on cue--a confused & disordered young individual enters a world of equally confused & disordered young individuals. but the director's weak swats at symbolism, philosophy and social commentary were completely off the mark, and it leaves us, the audience, feeling confused & disordered. bravo.perhaps if this movie had been presented as a european "american pie" flick, then i'd be able to turn off my brain and go along for the ride. but right off the bat, the director piques our deeper senses by introducing the symbolism of the twisted highways and the dichotomy of the "inner self" vs. the "public self" (one's "mother tongue" vs. one's "secondary language"). furthermore, it dives boldly into the subject of racial/national stereotyping. off to an interesting start, eh?wrong. that's as far as it goes. these interesting topics are hardly mentioned again except at the contrived epilogue-type ending which seemed to be the director's way of floundering to get back on topic. it reminded me of a meandering speech which goes nowhere, but the speaker ends by saying, "so in conclusion, i hope you see how this relates to my original thought!"furthermore, as other reviewers have pointed out, the cynical jab at stereotyping betrays itself. if the point is to ridicule the use of national stereotypes, then why did the director introduce a cockney-speaking, beer-swilling english brat as a caricature of prejudice? why did the director portray the american as a neanderthal (literally banging his chest & making ape noises at one point) whilst the europeans tolerate him superciliously? why is the british girl the one who sinks to uttering slurs (calling french people "frogs" and butchering the french language) while everyone else is above all that? the answer is that this isn't a deep or well-thought out film. it's simply an anglophobe's retort to the anglophiles. but really it's no different from the prejudice it seeks to ridicule! now there's a funny irony to consider.ok, philosophy, artistry & socio-political commentary aside, i was still very bored by this movie. there is one very funny gag which involves deceiving one of the girls' boyfriends, but aside from that i was hardly entertained at all. the only reason why i watched it through to the end is that i'd like to brush up on my french & spanish. (you see, we monolingual americans may be stupid, but we do try.)

not a terrible movie... but there are monster scenes where you will be rolling on the floor laughing - not a good thing for a action/thriller. the acting is generally pretty decent for a scifi channel movie. barry corbin plays a credible us senator, and lou diamond phillips again gives us a decent military/police/sheriff/agent/marshal figure. the special effects are well, "special" - for example, the external train shots are very obviously a model train.goofs: a meteor strikes a stationary car in the opening scene. the car bursts into flames but does not budge an inch. after the impact, the meteor is lodged in the top of the car's hood - impossible from the low angle that the meteor came in at.spoilers...a good portion of the movie's events are predictable, from the helicopter crash ("pull up, pull up!"), to the fact that the annoying people get it in the end, to the classic blown bridge over a 1000 foot gorge awaiting the train, to the sequel set-up at the end.the scenes showing the aliens attacking are hilarious. they are vicious cute puppets and move at lightening speed - remember the monty python rabbit? spoiler goof: in one scene four people shooting clip after clip cannot hit a single creature because they move at lightning speed. later in the movie todd bridges rigs up a mini flame thrower which he uses to dispatch a number of creatures at close range. on several occasions, lou diamond phillips is able to easily grab creatures with his bare hands.

i did my best to watch this two hour fiasco. it combined the awful special effects and plot of the original "blob," with an execrable boosting of the (outstanding in the original) screenplay of "runaway train." the only explanation for this movie is that someone needed to take a huge tax deduction and figured they'd combine it with a shot at hosting a casting couch. what an incredible stinker! lou diamond phillips is anxious to show us why he will take any part, no matter how bad. barry corbin continues his career as a typecast creep, a u.s. senator from texas and plays it well. he should next do the lead role in the story of trent lott or jesse helms. the women in this flick all seem to have gotten their roles as consolation prizes in the fay wray memorial screaming contest. special effects are unbelievably bad. h.s. kids in film class in north dakota could have done a better job. the writers must have pulled a heist at the cliché bank to accumulate this many. i couldn't watch any more without being forced to sit in the clockwork orange chair. i have no idea how it ended, except obviously, 119 minutes too late. ugh! caveat emptor.

we all know that special effects cost money, but it seems as if they could have used the money they saved writing the script to get some better shots. the train is obviously a model in most moving shots, the helicopter is obviously computer generated, the alien looks like the one from the end of spaceballs, except it's a decade later and spaceballs had an excuse.the only smart thing they did was blur all of the special effects to make them harder to see.not even the actors could compensate for such a poorly written script and it's pretty obvious they didn't really try either.please, don't waste your time. please.

*this review may contain spoilers... or maybe not. the warning is the same for all*dang it. just when i thought that scifi channel had used all of its ridiculous ideas for movies, they give us this. actually, the plot itself it's nothing we haven't seen in movies like snakes on a plane, deep blue sea, etc... that means, a monster/animal/menace of some kind is lurking in a close environment threatening a bunch of people. in this case, an alien in a train. wow.i must say that, when i first saw this thing on cable, i couldn't stop laughing. no scifi film had prepared me for this; it was so incredibly pathetic i couldn't believe it! the actors are all a bunch of stereotypical-genre characters. but since they're not so famous (to say the least), i wasn't expecting much of them. except diamond phillips. no comments there, but i think the guy was desperate to find a job. the problem was something called 'special effects', horrible even for scifi channel standards. that model/toy they made us believe it was a real train (not to mention the model/toy helicopter, bigger than a train's wagon), the meteor coming horizontally from space, the 'baby' alien (a sock puppet, and i ain't kiddin'), the regular aliens who looked pretty ugly... while they were static; when they started "moving", it was awful, the explosions (the terrorist blew up literally! and what about the exploding helicopter! just how many barrels of gas was that thing carrying?), the insane mathematics used (they couldn't even solve a school problem right!)... and i won't talk about that doomsday-like ending, by that time i didn't know if to keep laughing or to start crying. if i remember right, i did both.it's an ideal movie to have a good laugh, alone or with friends. but be warned; it's so ridiculous at so many levels... and you need a heck of a lot of suspension of disbelief...

watching alien express inspired feelings of awe, shock, pity and, yes, sheer terror. to think that actors who have done good work in the past should come to something like this. the horror, the horror.tell me if any of this sounds familiar.a train especially built for a political campaign is on it's way to las vegas for a big rally for the candidate, a senator from texas (barry corbin, the only actor with roles both alien express and no country for old men in the same decade). at a railroad crossing in utah a meteor incinerates a car waiting for the train to pass.the train stops. local law enforcement is summoned. oh, can it be? the senator has a lovely young lady (amy locane from cry-baby and melrose place) who just happened to have once been married to one of the officers answering the 911 call. lou diamond phillips (stand and deliver, la bamba) is the ex-husband.meanwhile eeeeevil aliens have managed to stow away on the train.the train leaves. lou gets his buddy to pilot a helicopter so that lou can drop onto the moving train (about 70 miles per hour) so that he can save the day. as the buddy's reward, he crashes the helicopter into the mountain.which is another example of how poorly written alien express is. the cop hero's sidekick must die, we all know that. but he's supposed to die near the end of the third act, usually while saving several lives.once on the train, lou manages to lose his shirt so that he can channel bruce willis in die hard by wearing a wife beater t-shirt. yeah, lou is 46 years old but he hits the gym. the part he's playing isn't worth bothering with, but he's in good shape.the senator is going to have an afternoon delight with miss utah, but aliens intercede and both he and the woman young enough to be his granddaughter pay the ultimate price.soon we have bomb threats, multiplying aliens, and of course the train goes out of control and speeds toward its date with destiny while lou and todd bridges (diff'rent strokes) try to save as many lives as they can.there is exactly one surprise in the entire movie. early in the story a couple lift wine glasses to their thirty-fifth anniversary, with hopes for thirty-five more years together. the dude gets banged up, but he and the mrs. both live. maybe the writers just lost track of them.this is the kind of movie that you'd love to be a fly on the wall. these actors who have done better work (and, really, deserve much better than this) are probably just happy for the work. did they actually think they were working on something worthwhile, or did they cry (and/or drink) themselves to sleep at night? at the end of the story the (fairly numerous, all things considered) survivors gather in the last car of the train, which is unhooked. the other cars go over a cliff but the one containing the protagonists stops just inches short of the cliff.lou and his ex are reunited. happiness reigns. i'd have thought that the first thing they'd do was get off the train so they'd have solid ground under their feet, but i digress.someone looks out the window and sees a shooting star. look, make a wish. then another. then more and more. the earth is being bombarded with meteors that will crack open and creepy crawly hand puppets with big teeth will be everywhere.it's gotten to a point that seeing the words "the sci-fi channel presents" on an "original" movie tells us that we'll be glad we have ti-vo so that we can fast forward through the next two hours. or, better yet, just go ahead and erase it two minutes into the story and spend that time more wisely.

it is way beyond me how this script was ever sold much less produced and distributed. the dialogue was so bad it was sickening. the train and helicopter scenes appeared to have been done on flash cards by high school students. lou diamond phillips must have hidden under his seat when this --- this "movie"? was shown at a private screening afterwhich he most likely left by the back door. the only emotion it aroused in me was pity for the cast, they had to "bite the bullet" to get through this one. i couldn't stand to watch all of it, it was so predictable that it was funny. who knows maybe it will be picked up by one of the networks as a situation comedy.

what a mess of a movie! if it wasnt for eric roberts and susan sarandon's performances ,this movie would be a total waste! a very muddled plot and phony dialogue.eric roberts debut....where did his career go from this movie on?nowhere but down!

when i heard the film was to be released and the theme of what it was about, i felt very curious. but when i saw it was the biggest deception of my life. technically speaking, the sound is poor, you can tell about man dialogs that were remade on studio that are poorly achieved in the final mix. secondo of all, the photography is mediocre, some part of the films show some soldiers with night vision goggles, and the way the cinematographer achieves that "dark night" is by illuminated everything like if they were in an actual military base with lights, there's no reference used of the moonlight, my god! thir but not least, most of the ac tings are really poor, it's totally not believable the roll of the wife of one of the soldier, her performance it's pretty poor.great disappointing, shame of the jury who chose to send this movie to represent colombia on the oscars.

tom is about to tuck into a delicious jerry sandwich when a huge bird of prey swoops down and flies off with his snack. not at all happy with having his sarnie stolen right from under his nose, tom takes off in hot pursuit, determined to retrieve his mousy morsel.as much as i love tom and jerry, i have got to say that this one is a bit of a stinker: the story is rather mundane; it introduces a badly conceived peripheral character that lacks charm; and it flogs the old 'dress the cartoon character up as a woman' gag to death.in my opinion, 'flirty birdy' rivals 'fraidy cat' and 'mouse in manhattan' for the title of weakest tom and jerry caper thus far.

this year's eurovision was to me a big disappointment. i've watched the eurovision song contest every year since 1986 (well, at least that's the earliest one i can remember, and i was only 2 at the time). as any other year this one contained both good, bad and horrible songs - nothing new there. however this year's show was the worst one i can remember. only very few good (decent's probably more like it) songs and a lot of absolutely terrible songs.turkey's winner song "every way that i can" sounded to me like a rip-off of turkish singer tarkan's hit "simarik", just sounding a lot worse. it didn't deserve to win from my point of view. belgium's song "sanomi", coming in second, was a no-language song. wonder what's next? animals singing? nevertheless the music for the song was quite catchy, giving the song a kind of dreamy feeling, to which the "lyrics" seemed appropriate. one of the better songs, but that's not saying much.after one of the closest races in eurovision history russian duo t.a.t.u. ended in third place just three points behind turkey and behind belgium, with "ne ver', ne boisia" ("don't trust, don't be afraid"). to me t.a.t.u. was one of the very few highlights of the show, surprising just about everyone by being some of the most covered up girls of all the female contestants. they let their song do the talking and if we ignore the fact that they failed to pitch a few times in the first chorus, they let the song speak very well indeed.the biggest surprise when looking at the scoreboard was austria. the bookmakers here in denmark had the biggest odds on that song - a song that indeed was beyond horrible - but ended up in 8th place. could it be that bum of his being shaken to the rhythm of the song? that performance was the one that made me and my family laugh the most, not because it looked good, but because it looked so stupid that it was actually fun.sweden did what they do the best; abba. in 1999 they won with "take me to your heaven", by sounding like abba. in 2001 they made the top 10 with "listen to your heartbeat", again sounding like abba, and once again this year they did it abba-style, again ending in the top 10.england was finally punished for making those absolutely horrible, non-catching songs, that they've been the past years.ireland ripped off the winner from 2000, "fly on the wings of love". and i could go on and on about how bad the songs were.i feel a bit sorry for the aussies, who this year finally got the chance to see the eurovision song contest. they deserved better than this.i wasn't surprised by the show though. the eurovision from 2000 to me stands out as one of the best in recent years. 2001 was quite good, but not as good. 2002 was okay, but certainly no more. this year was quite simply disappointing.let's hope it'll get better next year. if not for us, then at least for the aussies.4/10. one for t.a.t.u., one for the close race, one for the butt-shaking and one for all the rest.

the acting is generally pretty weak. the dialog was also apparently dubbed in after the filming, so it just doesn't come across well. what do you want for a tv movie?annette o'toole was ok; there were a few strong lines from the parent of the queen.otherwise, these kids weren't quite up to it. didn't impress my kids either.on the upside, it is only an hour long. considering that, it got through plot and character development in a creditable fashion. the settings and cinematography are ok too.some other viewers may like it for sentimental reasons.

i have recently gone to the movie theatres to see the new (2007) version of bridge to teribithia. after, i went to the library to rent the older version to see it again without paying again. i must say that i was extremely disappointed! i found the older version to have horrible acting as well as corny lines including jessie saying, "i know daddy, but i hurt so much inside" after leslie dies. it was quite horribly done and the casting was not much better in my opinion. i watched in amazement all the while saying no wonder they remade it. the story is great but trust me spend the money and see the new version, if you just see the old one you may never experience the true magic of teribithia.

i was in 6th grade and this movie aired on pbs during a series called 'wonderworks.' i distinctly remember sitting on a couch watching the movie with tears running down my face at the end. in the film jesse, the main character, forms an unusual friendship with a girl named leslie. due to a very simple, but careless mistake one of the pair dies. at the time, i found the story very powerful, because the fatal mistake is exactly the type of mistake a kid would make and so any kid watching the film will find it very easy to identify with and feel the emotional weight of the tragedy that ensues.last year, i finally tracked down a vhs copy of the show. i probably should have stuck with my memories. watching the show as an adult i was absolutely shocked by what a horribly made film this was. my girlfriend had a similar memory of the movie as well, and she too was pretty sad about how bad the movie was compared to her memories. many adults probably have a good memory of watching this movie when they were kids. i strongly advise that these people leave their memories intact, and avoid seeing this film as an adult.

i am a fifth grade language arts teacher, and after we read this book (which the students loved), then we watched the movie. they laughed out loud! unfortunately, it's not a comedy! the acting was so awful, i felt like i was watching a bunch of kids in the neighborhood putting on a play. my students were mimicking the lines and making fun off and on the whole way through. i have to agree with them, at times, it was pretty bad. still, i would show it to students again, just for fun, and to compare the film with the book. we did a venn diagram (teachers know what that is) afterward, to show what was the same in both and what were the differences, so there is an educational value in showing it. i noticed that another adaptation is being filmed for 2005 so we can only hope the acting will be better!

i have been collecting iron man comics since the early 70s and always enjoyed the character who is far far from the average clean cut hero and his many and varied enemies. there have been no less than three attempts at an animated series for iron man and only the original and part of the second have ever done the character justice. so i was somewhat hopeful that this newest version would be good. boy was i wrong! the dvd art is very misleading and presents an image that is not the movie. fist off the good, what little there is... the art and animation are well drawn and the writing and dialog are generally good, though with notable exceptions. character voices are very well selected and each character is distinctive and well acted. now for the bad... unfortunately the writers opted to totally screw around with both iron man's origin and especially the mandarin's. on top of that they decided to do iron man and his opponents all in cgi. bad cgi. this makes them stand out almost as badly as live actors would in a cartoon. the cg work is often repetitive and glaring shortcuts are taken at times. the cg battles are clumsy as well, further enhancing the fact that cg and line animation do not mix well. the movie would certainly have fared better had they opted to actually draw all the characters. another problem is that iron man is in his traditional red and gold suit for all of one battle! and its not even the big fight at the end. all this drags the movie down and it never picks up.************ spoilers (or warnings) may follow ************the movie starts off with an interestingly unusual stop motion credit sequence of machinery, welding and gears. then we are introduced to what looks like a chinese temple in the process of being restored, and prominent is a statue of what fans will recognize as the mandarin. things go strangely, impeding progress in restoring the temple. overseeing it is james rhodes, tony stark's long time friend. seems they plan to actually raise the temple up from the earth, despite opposition by a group who insist that raising the temple will bring about a terrible disaster. rhodes is captured in a raid. stark, shown in a hot tub with a lovely lady, is informed of the problems and sets out to personally oversee the project and rescue his friend while in the background his father deals with board executives who are pushing to have tony removed. tony arrives only to have his armored escort ambushed and blown to pieces. tony later awakens mortally wounded in the heart and a prisoner of the rebels. he is saved only by quick action from rhodes and a scientist. eventually stark must build the prototype gray iron armor and makes good an escape, but only after some loss of life. while with the rebels he meets a troubled girl named li mei, and the two fall in love. the temple is raised and four elemental beings (all done in cg) appear and proceed to start collecting hidden rings of power. stark and rhody find trouble back home but manage to confront the elementals without success in really stopping them, first using the aquatic armor, then the more classic red and gold armor and finally everything returns to the temple and stark is back in the bulky gray armor for a final showdown and a run in with what may be fin fang foom (also in cg.) here the story takes a major twist as it turns out that the mandarin needs a host body to manifest. this leads to a somewhat tragic final battle marred by the fact that the mandarin is little more than a ghost and isn't seen till the last 5 minutes of the movie. ugh...if you are an iron man fan then you will likely not enjoy this outing. and even non-fans may well find the movie somewhat lacking or not.

this was something i had been looking forward to seeing. the ultimate avengers movies had both exceeded my expectations and since iron man has been one of my favorite marvel characters i thought that this same production team would be able to do some really great stuff with an iron man solo title. but the final film was unsatisfying. i wasn't expecting them to spend most of the movie paying tribute to iron man gray armor. the red and gold armor is seen for maybe ten or so minutes all together. not a major complaint but not what i expected from the ads and box. the worse thing however was the story, the acting and the cell-shaded cgi animation for the monsters and iron man armor that was not convincing. it didn't blend in well with the cell animation at all. even on it's own it seem stick-like and lifeless. tony stark's character arc, as incredibly slow as it takes, is so forced and unconvincing. i wanted to see this movie because i love iron man but after forcing myself through the film i wondered if they couldn't have come up with something that had been as good as the ultimate avengers movies.

i am obviously disappointed so i'll be brief and won't waste your time. first off, the plot was uninspired... at least. the animation was even worse, we're in 2008 for god's sake and it looked like a shinier version of g.i.joe. i won't even bother characterizing the actors' performance and the dialogs. or maybe i will 'cause i just saw that in order to post a comment over here you need 10 lines (?!??!?!). where were we? oh yeah the performance, well it was totally flat, lacking passion and talent if i am excused. now as for the dialogs, just like the acting, no memorable quotes, nothing that someone wouldn't expect. let's just hope the movie will be decent ...at least.

don't get me wrong, the guy's a success dynamo, but he got to the top by selling overpriced plastic toys to impulsive brats. so i get a little peeved when he looks at comic book fans as an extension of that same market.see, "the invincible iron man" wouldn't be bad if it were slotted on a saturday morning and geared exclusively toward undiscerning children. but it's not directed exclusively at children. periphery characters are killed every five minutes and there's enough bloodshed and semi-nude bodies to make network censors squirm, so it isn't quite cut out for children's television.so what audience is this video aiming for then? it's the audience that enjoys nigh intelligible story lines about reviving a tyrannical chinese emperor with 5 arcane rings, that's who. and i think that audience is restrictively small.a lot of great writers have passed through marvel's leathery yoni over the decades. so it's a shame that marvel would risk their pricey animation investments on so many questionable storytellers and scribes who, like mr. arad, are better accustomed to peddling action figures during saturday morning cartoons. how many lukewarm receptions do marvel have to endure before they come up with a better strategy? ***animation: just passable cels, some segments are better than others, a low budget look all throughout -- this ain't no bakshi (ralph) and it ain't no bluth (don)! cg animation's okay, but far from impressive.story: a litany of clichés, all over the place, convoluted, contrived, and uninspired.characters: so why is rhodes even here if all he does is add to stark's sexual ambiguity? hmmm... her dad's in a wheelchair... tony misses his mom... asian chicks are hot and, apparently, little else; the female lead is thoroughly objectified by the feature's end.performances: can't blame competent voice actors for a bad script.art: very western musculature, very clean lines, faces are very derivative of eastern art, very boring mattes, very bland cg.conclusion: not great, but worth a watch for the fans and those who enjoy superhero myths. a 'must-buy' for collectors. a valuable "what not to do" course for junior animators.

first of all, the title "daily" is a lie. every "daily show" program opens with an on-screen visual of the date it was made, followed by a pause and the opening announce. on the many days when they are re-running a daily show, they slip-cue the tape and omit the date and begin with the opening announce giving the false impression that the show is a new one. that's a lie. there is no mention of it being a rebroadcast. and that kind of crap is just a small indicator of how sneaky and deceptive this show is. furthermore, it's only on 4 nights a week. that's not quite "daily" - meaning monday through friday - another shortcoming but one i am grateful for.it's sad to think that many clueless young people use this fake news program as their main, often only, news source. this leaves them woefully ignorant and much worse - badly misinformed.although it leans liberal-left, politically, this show can be amusing at times. however, its veracity is low. facts and information are often cleverly twisted to fit the writers' agendas. it's often hard to tell where the facts leave off and the fiction and comedy writing begin. the result is pre-digested, reinterpreted information designed to persuade and influence. this is called "propaganda".the remote interviews are heavily kluged in editing.it really loses me when it bashes god and christians - which it does all too often. however, you'll never hear anything vaguely anti-semitic.if jon stewart and company attacked anyone but christians, it would be considered an offensive outrage. the names in the credits explain the source.

jon stewart (aka john liebowitz) constantly rips conservatism and anything republican. this liberal comic is anything but, as he pours his cutting "humor" down the throats of impressionable youths. i've viewed the show while stuck in a waiting room while my car was repaired and this guy borders on treason. he'll take al queda's side over bush any day. he's shameless and everything he says is punctuated by a phony laughtrack. i do remember four years ago when he "interviewed" john kerry. the two made faces at each other that seemed to preclude a makeout session. it was like, "get a room, you guys". i just don't like smirky little traitors who peddle their propaganda. call me shallow. the daily show has had a long run and there are many likeminded liberals who have a seething hatred for republicans and conservatism. i'm not surprised at its success, but do that many people actually watch comedy central? that mancia guy makes me barf.

comedy works best when it relates to stuff that's true. but even as such, some effort is required to make jokes that everyone likes and even the most grumpy of viewers can crack a smile. when i look at the daily show, i see the whole "it's funny because it's true" thing, but i don't, however, see the effort and often times i don't if they're being funny or just trying to make a point(i notice this mostly in the interview segments). the daily show started off as a news parody, by definition they poke fun at how the media plays it's own news by pretending to be inept and dumb news reporters and anchormen and they tackled tons of subjects from science to movies and sometimes politics, then jon stewart came along...and it all went to hell. thr first years of jon stewart's reign were arguably golden, i though he was so funny, but then 2004 came along and it's where you start to notice a huge chance in the show from there on. the show's humor has gone stale, colbert left, steve carell left, many of the show's best anchors left and now it's mostly about jon stewart and the show's gone from a parody to a semi-serious news show, essentially evening news but with some gags here and there. for those who haven't seen the show and are having trouble finding out what to watch on cable, i'll give you a brief description of what the show's about(at least until 2009): -bush, cheney and all republicans(unless they happen to embrace an opinion shared by democrats as well) are stupid, evil, corrupt and hypocrites, anyone who stands by conservative beliefs is also evil, corrupt and a hypocrite; -people who doubt the man-made global warming theory are evil and stupid; -vote democrat; there, i saved you 25 minutes of your time, go watch something else. at first, i though that the producers hijacked the show for their own personal political agenda, but when i actually see the interviews, it becomes crystal clear what this show's about(what i mentioned above), but i'll get to that in a moment. frist off, the humor in the daily show according to jon stewart expects you to find a random filmed quote said by either bush, cheney or a random republican humorous because well, because. jon sets up the joke, setting it in writers specific context and expects that the random quote somehow delivers the punchline. so, unless you «get» the context, it's entirely useless as bankable humor. also the daily show expects you to laugh when they show a montage of one politician talking and in another separate video saying another thing, again putting into a context that the writers expect you to understand, thus making it funny,why? well, because jon said so. now imagine the daily show using that formula countless times for years every week, and you'll start to understand of what used to be a laugh-fest that is now 25 minutes of just silent stares(yes, even in the lewis black segments). at first, some decent amount of effort was put into these jokes, but now much less of that is apparent. and the interview have the most odd sense of bias that i've ever seen. jon stewart calls bill o'reilly a bully, but what does that make him, when he sucks up to every single actor and democrat(john kerry before, obama today) that appears on the show and looks down upon respected republicans and accomplished conservative newsmen such as weekly standard's own bill kristol? he puts them in some sort of people's tribunal as if they're being charged with a crime, often times any person on the show who stands up for bush is portrayed as delusional, as if that person's out of touch with reality and assumes he speaks for the majority of america, that's the de facto treatment for anybody conservative, unless they happen to share a similar point of view with democrats, if so then's it's an endless love fest. but still, it doesn't matter, in the eyes of jon you are already wrong before you walked into the show and are still wrong afterwords. that's the kind of treatment you get if you are anything remotely right-wing. now you have to wonder what that could possibly have anything to do with humor. one wonders what'll happen if democrats win the white house...

i have tried watching this show on several different occasions and each time found it to be utterly pale of humor.the reason, to mention one thing, is that it is solely based on ridiculing anything the republicans have done. in short it is basically democratic party political opinions touted as humor.all mr. stewart does is wisecrack about anything the republicans have done and the audience wets themselves in gales of forced laughter.my guess is that the left is so devoid of any real substance that they have to define themselves in terms of how much they all hate republicans.-ld_____________________________my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/

this show has shown it's true colors now that democrats are in power. it never did lead the world in iq as anyone who thought it has intelligence has been programmed to think one way (which is a scary thing).comedy central moved this & it's spin off back to an earlier time once the democrats took power for a reason- because now when the democrats screw up - which is just as often as republicans do - stewart no longer takes pot shots at them. that is why the ratings for both this & the spin are dropping.basically, most of the humor now is either lame, or lame sarah palin jokes - which all the ratings dropping comedians are now telling. the facts to back this up speak for themselves. the jay leno show which has been doing the same kind of humor is on the verge of being canceled. the ratings for letterman & conan & the shows that follow them are down.so emperor stewart is not alone. trouble is if any of them start taking real rips at the bungling democrats in power, they could raise their ratings in a hurry because the best humor is always at the expense of whose in power. the bush years proved that because the ratings for this show & colbert, & letterman & leno were higher there.o'bama has done one thing, proved these shows have to be willing to take chances & rip the folks in power if they are to prosper. right now, the daily show & stewart are sagging but maybe they can get lucky & have palin elected as the first woman president in 2012. then the lame palin jokes will become ratings grabbers.

for some reason i just didn't like it at all and felt embarrassed about how bad it was since i bought it and watched it with my family. all of us hated it with a passion. it's a nice enough kids' movie, maybe in the year it came out. however, think about it: an outdated kids' movie? what's the point? kids do not generally like to watch such old movies anyway, and i don't see what adults are supposed to get out of this movie at all.some kids' movies (like mary poppins or wizard of oz) can be enjoyed even now, but time bandits is totally outdated. for your reference, and i think applicable in this case, i also did not like dr strangelove or spinal tap at all. so, if you disagree with me on those similarly outdated movies, you might like time bandits.there is also a horrible case of overacting as i recall from the 'bad guys'. think of the two stupid 'bad pirates' in the pirates of the c. movies, except in time bandits they are not even remotely funny.anyway, i warned you, that's all i can do. people that rate this movie high must have liked it from many years ago. if you have not seen it before, then don't bother watching it now.

i got this movie from the library, and saw it had a lot of actors i like in it(john cleese, ian holm, ralph richardson, etc), so i got it and watched it. i expected cleese to have a large role since he had first billing, i was surprised to find out that he had about five minutes of screen time, along with everyone else i liked. this movie is amazingly pointless, the characters are nobodies, the plot is non-existent, and the ending is one of the worst endings i have ever seen. there were a few funny parts, but that's about it. stay away from this movie if you want to prevent going "what?" and "huh?", a lot. and if you don't want to waste your time. ignore the people who say this is a very funny movie...it isn't. just stay away from it at all costs...please.

i know terry gilliam is considered as a good director but claiming that this movie is good is just foolish. what was the movie about? what is it a spoof? fantasy? comedy? satire? no answer there from gilliam's screenplay. totally confused and pointlessly hurtling from one historical age to another. i find it amusing that some people actually call this movie magical. is it because they have to praise any movie which is vague and indecisive on what it is about?? 3 stars for special effects considering it is 1981. roger ebert has it right in his review. the movie is ambiguous and looks like gilliam's romp with money just to make a vague children's move masquerading as a historical revue. the movie also tries to confuse the would-be viewer by giving john cleese and sean connery top billing.

i have seen this movie and in all honestly was quite disappointed. and in my opinion this movie lacks heart. i frankly didn't care what happen to the characters by the end of the movie. there was so much there they could have done with the movie that they didn't because they were either so rapped up in trying to be obscure and make some deep comment on life, or trying so hard not to, that the characters and story were completely lost in all of it. i have seen another picture by this director and enjoyed it well enough. but i felt this film lack of the whimsy and heart of the other and i was left wondering what the point was, or if the point of the movie was that it had no point. honestly, while i didn't feel like tearing my hair out during the movie, i did remorse the lost time on the sad little film.i have no doubt that some people will love this movie, but frankly i didn't.

well.....horror this ain't, but.......!!!??? a terrible low low budget backwood-flic of the worst kind, sort of and...therefore quite charming and funny to watch...at least on my tv set!!! a cross between pete walker, herschell gordon lewis and...say....damn, i give up...just can't come up with any "prettier" resemblances for this trashy movie. everything is soooo wrong that i just have to enlist it in my film collection alongside with....death in venice.....nekromantik.....blue velvet and the good,bad,ugly... right !!?? people with some small talent for adding gory inserts or sexy happenings to film they buy offa other people, should pick this film up immediately....sure is a fat lil' ol' goldmine waiting here, oh maaaannnn!!!!!

i went into this film expecting/hoping for a sleazy drive-in style slice of seventies exploitation, but what i got was more of a bizarre pseudo western with far too much talking and not enough action. it's clear that this film was made on a budget; the locations are drab and poorly shot, while the acting leaves a lot to be desired also. the plot focuses on a trio of robbers (a father and two sons) that steal a load of gold after killing some miners. they come across a cabin inhabited by a young girl and her stepmother...and all this is told in flashbacks by the young girl, currently residing in an asylum. it's clear that directors louis leahman and william sachs thought they were making something really shocking; but despite its best efforts, south of hell mountain is just too boring to shock the viewer. the film drones on for about eighty minutes and most of it consists of boring characters spouting off boring and long-winded dialogue. the only good thing i have to say about the film is with regards to the music; which is good in places. the ending is the only other good thing about the movie; and that's only because it's the last thing that happens. i wouldn't recommend anyone bothers tracking this down...there was much better trash made in the seventies.

an absolutely baffling western featuring flash-forward sequences set in an insane asylum, south of hell mountain was one of the first films produced by the schlockmeisters at cannon film. co-directed by william sachs, who would later deliver such fan favourites as the incredible melting man and galaxina, the film tells the very dull tale of a trio of gold robbers who stumble upon a cabin occupied by two women who are hiding some secrets that aren't worth discovering. the cast (most of whom never made another film) try gamely, but are hamstrung by the screenplay, which generally makes no sense. the asylum scenes are edited in to little effect and are punctuated by ridiculous sound effects and tape loops. ultimately, it's a lot of talk and little else.

maybe it is unfair for me to review this movie because i walked out well before the end. that's odd, because i usually like shakespeare on the screen and i enjoyed midsummers night's dream once, many years ago, when i saw it on the stage. i think that two things did me in: that squeaky twerp with the shakespearian name, calista flockhart, and michelle feiffer sitting in a giant clamshell. well, i suppose you could say it supposed to be a comedy -- but when the scenery is funny and the actors aren't, i'd say we have a bad movie on our hands....

the only entertaining thing that i found about watching this movie was listening to star wars coming through the wall of the movie theatre (yes i go to a really bad movie theatre). this movie is so mind numbingly bad that i think i would rather have my eyes scratched out by a cat rather than watch it again.let's compare it to the original. one is charming, funny, exciting, well acted, and one of the best movies ever made, the other is so far from funny that all you can do is hope that your eyeballs will fall out so you don't have to watch any more. i'm sorry christina ricci is a fine actress but cannot compare with hailley mills, and don't even get me started on doug e. doug in a part one occupied by the amazing and absolutely charming dean jones. dean jones' tiny part in the new version is the only partially redeeming part of this movie, and it is the only reason i can justify a 1* rating (also because the imdb doesn't go into negatives).

i am really at a loss as to how anyone could give this movie a 10 (or even more than a 2!). it is full of bad lines, bad acting, bad slapstick, etc. i never thought i could see worse acting than the purposefully badly acted scenes at the beginning of uhf, but this was it. and just when you think it can't possibly get any worse, it does! over and over again! you actually could have watched this in a theater? it wasn't worth free on tv! my 4-year-old and 1-year-old liked it some, but they wanted to see the cat more and the cat was almost never on.

if you never have read the book and never intend to read it in the future, go on and watch the movie (6/10). it is a nice fantasy movie with well done cgi, nice acting, a beautiful environment and an above-average fantasy story.if you have read the book like me about 10 times or more and really love it, don't expect too much (or better: don't expect anything at all). the story is totally different from the original book. this may explain that the movie is voted 1/10 from people around 40 or more (like me) and much better from people who most probably never read the book before and thus expect nothing.most of the differences between movie and book are not really necessary and change the setting (in my opinion much to the worse): - the magic in the book works with rituals for classic magical effects. (changing weather, creating illusions, transform into animals, ...) in the movie the magic is more like "jedi-school for the middle ages" (tm) (wooden sticks instead of lightsabers). that the devil is looking like emperor palpatine (after part iii) doesn't make it really better.- the mill in the book is not totally cut off the world like in the movie. in the book the story is set near dresden, which krabat visits one time with his master and also he visits some nearby villages for festivities. (this part might have been changed to cut costs.) i also don't understand why in the movie the mill is located in the hills while the nearby graveyard is set in the high mountains.- the whole surrounding is the average run of the mill fantasy medieval style. lots of mud everywhere, dirty faces, not an orderly kitchen, only very rough houses. the book never suggested such an environment.- in the book the master tries to make krabat his successor but krabat rejects. krabat is somewhere between admiration, distance and silent rejection. in the movie krabat rejects the master always openly like a stubborn schoolboy.- the movie is set in 1647 instead of around 1720. this makes it impossible for the master to tell some stories from his youth probably around 170x. ok, the stories are missing anyway in the movie.also some explanations given in the book would have been helpful and would not cost so much minutes: - in the book all work done at day is effortless and work in the night is like normal work. this explanation is missing in the movie. sometimes the boys are sweating and sometimes they are happy.- the book explains why only a few "gesellen" try to confront the master: if the master dies by any mundane reasons, the "gesellen" are free and keep their magical powers. if the master dies at the confrontation, all will lose their power forever.

this film is about the encounters of 7 couples on hampstead heath in one sunny wednesday afternoon.it shows 7 different types of couples: married, divorced, breaking up a relationship, homosexual, elderly, blind date and escort service. they are not connected to each other apart from the geographical location, so that is a disappointment. the film is a collage of conversations, without any discernible plot. the film jumps from a pair to another without any logic. i find this film boring and purposeless. the only redeeming feature is the great weather throughout the film. it is sad that talents like ewan mcgregor and sophie okonedo get wasted by this film.

the acting is good.thats the positives out of the way! sosn is shallow and superficial.almost all the characters are middle class and english.the gay men are depicted as fickle sexual predators aiming to use children in their empty lives.this film could only appeal to people who know hampstead heath and would get minor satisfaction from pointing out any landmarks.there is no time to engage with the characters and has a result you really don,t care about them,catherine tate at the height of her comedic fame stars as a woman seeking a divorce from her husband and on screen for about the same time as her nana sketches failed to convince,however if she had said "what a f****** liberty" i would have agreed i'd rather take a walk in the park;unintelligent rubbish!

this film attempts to cash in on the success of richard curtis movies, particularly "love actually" (which i loved) - a series of disparate scenes following the love lives of various couples. it's a great idea poorly executed. the script tries to be a little too clever and simply doesn't resonate. most of the acting is stilted which is more a reflection on the director than the actors.the version i saw (on a plane) was called "scenes from a park", which is a more appropriate title as not all the scenes were of a 'sexual nature'.i was so looking forward to this movie, but ultimately it is disappointing. don't bother.

there is nothing mean spirited or evil about this movie. it's just terribly dull. dull is the photography--- the film stock appears old and faded and washed-out. maybe it was even 16mm blown up to 35mm, dunno. dull is the script, which is tedious and 'jules pfeiffer'-ish. that is, kind of 1960s bossa-nova cocktail party cool. like our beatnik grandparents might have spoken if they were trying to appear really straight. the 'slice-of-life' characters were mostly annoying. true, they were real to life, but hey, if i wanted to see truly ordinary people doing really mundane and ordinary things, i'd just watch myself. i wouldn't trapse all the way down to a cinema and blow five quid, and an evening, watching someone else do it.i expected a funny, bright rom-com. what i got was more like what two intelligent and moderately talented 19 or 20 year-olds might have produced on their first day with a new video camera.i gave this a 4 out 10, because it appears that someone tried, at least.

this movie is by far the worst movie ever, the story line is weak and never shows what happens to the people after the 20 was left they hands. this really bugs me. it drags on and on with out any meaning, very boring. the only good thing was the cast, wow, lots of big time actors and actress in it. but besides that it was horrible, terrible and repulsive, do yourself a favor, do not watch it.i gave it a 1 out of 10

this script was mildly original when it was written in 1935, but the poor performances and the inconsistent quality level make it impossible to recommend. some of the vignettes are absolutely terrible and the dialogue is never natural. a few of the plot twists were creative, but i was very surprised to see it so highly rated here at the imdb. a few scenes are worthwhile, it's as a film that if fails completely to entertain. if you like this sort of montage, run don't walk and get "tales of manhattan" (1942) a marvelous film that follows the life and times of a topcoat.

i did not like this movie. i rented it hoping it would be something like the 10th kingdom. i was disappointed when i discovered it wasn't. i also found it just plain nervracking. the acting was bad, the characters where unbelievable and the time jumps were crazy. i only recomend this film if your in the mood to see a crazy dude running around, but i'm sure there are better films with the same thing. i can't believe i wasted my time on this one.

loving the andersen fairy tails as a child and recently having seen some intriguing documentaries on this odd, though brilliant, author, i eagerly looked forward to see this made-for-tv film. unfortunately the experience was nothing but a disappointment leaving me in anger and confusion. first of all the story/script is filled with inaccuracies and downright fantasies and in this way creating almost a completely new story while shamefully abusing andersen's fairy tales, presumably in order to sell the crap to suckers like me. secondly, pretty-boy actor (really... ever seen a picture of the real andersen?) kieran brew manages to portray hans christian as mentally retarded rather than the brilliant though very disturbed character he indeed was. though annoying and irritating like andersen, brew is missing the required charisma to create any feelings of compassion what so ever. thirdly. the love story between andersen and the fictional jetta (whom actually should be henriette, the wife of edvard collin)... why? this man has lived such an interesting life, it should be enough as a foundation to a great movie!i could continue this to be a very long list but feel it safest to simply recommend all of you to spend your time and money on something else instead.

i really liked the idea of traveling between dimensions, and i even liked the wade/quinn tension in early episodes. some of the worlds they created gave the main characters extremely interesting backdrops for their stories. however, as the show went on there were more silly disputes among the friends and less of a true bond. there was less wonder and excitement when they were involved in other worlds and more condescension. and every world had one of the characters falling in love. the writing just got boring and everything was way too over the top. too bad it would've been nice to have a closely knit band of friends (a la star wars) traveling to different dimensions on tv for several years, rather than a tired band of knit pickers.

ok, first off there may be a spoiler here since i don't know what constitutes giving out too much information. my subject line says it all but surely people will want to know why it's so stupid.first off, this film follows a bunch of yuppies as they go to a sports game in chicago but wind up taking the wrong exit and winding up in the ghetto. scary, huh? well, first of all, emilio is driving everyone in the world's most overblown rv/winnebago, tricked out with satellite dishes and crap like that on it. so these guys are going to a sports game (i forget which, though likely the bulls or the white sox since they're near the oh-so-scary ghetto), yet they can't even make it down the freeway without having an onboard viewing command center that would put espn to shame. yet they're smart enough to earn livings that would pay for the stuff, but are such sports fans that they don't even know which exit to get off at on their way to the game they so love.i gave up on the movie within a half hour after that, but the reasons were plentiful. they wind up in the ghetto, yet their main danger to their existence is denis leary. a white guy. i'm no racist, but come on. in anything resembling reality - and this film was trying to be an urban nightmare - denis leary would not be trying to kill emilio estevez, he'd be hitching a ride to get the f*** out of dodge himself!!!this is easily one of the dumbest movies ever created, although i'm not familiar with much of the rest of the world's cinema. if mst3k were still on, they surely would have devoted an episode to this one.

the weakest of the 'old' crew star trek films, this film suffers from an awful script and obvious budget constraints, particularly in the mishandled finale. the bones of a good movie are here, and the directing from shatner is not as bad as is commonly made out, but the characters end up speaking and acting way out of the style that the previous 3 films had carefully established. lawrence luckinbull is convincing as the renegade vulcan with msyterious and mystical powers to influence people and these powers are responsible for some of the best scenes, particularly for deforest kelley who shines as 'bones' mccoy in this his second last movie. however, as good as those scenes are, they ultimately do not advance the plot, and end up feeling as more of a distraction. a great score from the ever reliable goldsmith and some funny scenes in yosemite between the main three are not enough to cover the gaping chasms in the plot, and the frankly embarassing attempts at humour serve only to alienate even die hard trekkies. all in all, a wealth of possibilities which although it fails to deliver, has its moments. watch out for the pool table in the bar brawl scene...

that's the only word i can think of to describe this movie. not waste as in a waste of time (any time spent with these characters is never wasted), but waste as in a waste of opportunities.when i see this movie, i think of all the star trek novels that were written which would have made a much better film than the story shatner chose. the setup was like an average television episode, while the finish felt like the climax (if you can call it that) of the first movie.nimoy, in directing ii-iv, focused on the character of spock--how he faced the kobayashi maru outside of the classroom, and how he handled his emotional live now that he had a chance to start fresh. shatner could have done the same with kirk here, but he didn't. we don't know much about kirk that we didn't know before. again, one of the novels would have been better--try "my enemy, my ally" for a very interesting character study of our friend james t. the minor characters are used mostly for cute bits, and the scotty-uhura subplot seems way out of left field, particularly since the subtext in the original series was sulu-uhura.even hardcore fans can't find much to enjoy here. sorry, but it's true.

star trek v definitely earns the dubious distinction of being the weakest film in the star trek series. despite the good acting efforts by the actors, it suffered from a general lack of funding from paramount pictures. paramount pictures was not enthusiastic about this film at its very onset.the movie begins with the enterprise crew enjoying their extended shore leave as a reword for saving the earth from total ecological disaster. their shore leave is cut short when a disturbance occurs on nimbus iii, the planet of intergalactic peace. captain kirk and the enterprise arrive at nimbus iii only to have their ship hijacked by sybok, spock's half-brother. sybok brainwashes the crew of the enterprise and sets it on a suicide mission to rendezvous with "god" just past the great barrier at the center of our galaxy. captain kirk must then figure out a way to regain control of his ship and to fend off the enterprise's klignon pursuers.the only bright spot in the film is the acting and directing. william shatner, leonard nimoy, deforest kelley, laurence luckinbill, and the rest of the cast all give good performances. william shatner also does a pretty good job directing this film.however, the film suffered from a general lack of enthusiasm and funding. first, the part of sybok was initially offered to sean connery, but he refused. so, laurence luckinbill got the part. second, many of the special effects were severely cut back ... reducing the movies entertaining potential. third, the scene that depicts the arrival at the great barrier left much to be desired. finally, the romance between scotty and uhura in this film did not make much sense at all ... considering that no such romance ever occurred prior to this point in the star trek universe and it was never explained how such a romance could suddenly materialize between star treks iv and v.overall, this is a very weak film. you should probably just skip this film and move on to star trek vi. after all, the cast and crew made star trek vi partly to bail themselves out after their debacle with star trek v.

no one expects the star trek movies to be high art, but the fans do expect a movie that is as good as some of the best episodes. unfortunately, this movie had a muddled, implausible plot that just left me cringing - this is by far the worst of the nine (so far) movies. even the chance to watch the well known characters interact in another movie can't save this movie - including the goofy scenes with kirk, spock and mccoy at yosemite.i would say this movie is not worth a rental, and hardly worth watching, however for the true fan who needs to see all the movies, renting this movie is about the only way you'll see it - even the cable channels avoid this movie.

i'm aware that there are some fans who might like this movie. i'm aware that the idea of 'searching for god' might appear interesting to some, to me, however, it's really boring.the movie is simply boring. when it does get a little bit interesting, it gets stupid. come on... kirk fights against god and wins? how low can we possibly get? the only good part in the film is the camping scene at the first 5 minutes, which is truly great, but after that, the movie becomes boring, irritating, with nothing more than a good music.thank god we have star trek vi. (oops, kirk beat him).

i don't think i can add much more to what has already been said about this film. however, i can offer a small recollection from seeing st-v in the theater. in the last (dreadful) scene, as the camera is pulling out from the camping shot and it seems likely that the credits will start rolling at any second, the audience seemed to rise in unison. normally, for a movie like this, at least -some- die-hard fans stay to watch right up until the final disclaimer. as the people filed out, i remember hearing no laughing and cheerful banter, only low murmurs.i remember reading a movie review in the local paper in which the critic said that it was so bad that only trek fans would like it. what an idiot. the fans were the ones most apt to tear it apart first!favorite worst scene: target shooting on a voyager space probe, through a periscope no less! space must be a much smaller frontier than we thought.

while star trek the motion picture was mostly boring, star trek the final frontier is plain bad. in this terrible sequel, the crew is on shore leave when they get a distress signal from the federation that ambassadors representing earth, romulus and kronos (the klingon home world) have been kidnapped by a renegade vulcan bent on his quest to attain a starship to venture into the great barrier. there, he hopes to find god. using mysticism and bad writing, he persuades many of the senior officers of the enterprise to betray kirk and get a hold of the ship. they do reach the inside of the great barrier and find a planet where they do meet a god-like alien. this one is so bad it is hard to figure out where to begin. at the core is a good idea that is never really developed. the plot goes nowhere instead of where no man has gone before. it is almost like the writers had no idea how to end this fiasco. the action scenes don't have the suspense of wrath of kahn, the philosophy is boring, and the humor is stale. now i will focus most of my anger on william shatner. when he takes the director's chair, the ego gets bigger. most of the focus is on him, spock, and mccoy, but does not give the others enough to do. moreover, whereas shatner is usually guilty of over-acting in previous movies and television spots, he is just plain bad in this one. now kirk is reckless, a practical jokers, and silly. one of the worst scenes involves the three leaders singing the song, "row row row your boat" in a round by a campfire. in any case, this is the worst of the star trek franchise. i should have given it three out of ten instead of five.

even not being a fan of the "star trek" movies or universe of shows and books and such, i still find some enjoyment in some of the movies featuring the old cast and in the case of "first contact" even the new cast a bit. this one though was kind of sad to watch...it seemed to want to be so much, but it failed on so many levels to be one of the worst star trek movies. the plot is very far fetched seeming to want to combine three or four stories into one ultimate trek adventure, but it ends up an unfunny when it tries to be, not tense when it wants to be and not action packed like it tries to be mess of inconsistencies. the whole movie to take a phrase from spock is illogical. the effects are nothing special as i have seen episodes of next generation that are just as good, which is to say it is fine for a television show, but not a major motion picture. the plot is laughable as the gang at first tries to stop spock's brother then joins him on his quest to find god, yes you read that correctly. the klingons make a tacked on appearance, which actually will set up the much better undiscovered country movie. all in all you know it is bad when the best part of the film is kirk, bones and spock singing row your boat, well spock was not really singing, but rather questioning the lyrics.

leonard nimoy directed star trek iii, which wasn't half bad. maybe william shatner thought seeming as how nimoy did it he could. after seeing this film he should have reversed that decision.star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series. the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life, the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain.the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god (seriously) i just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards. she looked like she was taking part in a granny competition. if they meant to make her look sexy. they were wrong. she looked grotesque.how this got to production or even written...well it dosen't bear thinking about. the only place good for this film is in the garbage. the worst one of the series.

when i first saw it 9 years ago, when i was 9. i thought it stunk. i'm 18 now and i still think it stinks. i mean geez no special effects or anything, it was boring and kinda anti-climatic. my cousin watched once and george takai (sulu) kept talking about how it was supposed to be so much better, but they kept cutting to the budget. it would have been a great episode, but it was a terrible movie.

supposedly, director william shatner had in mind a much 'darker' film when it came to 'star trek v: the final frontier' but the suits at paramount, looking at the huge box-office receipts taken in by its humor-filled predecessor, insisted the new film have plenty of laughs too. so what we get is arguably the weakest and goofiest of the six star trek movies with the original cast. there are bad ideas aplenty, along with a few good ones, and if you're in a charitable mood, you could look at 'the final frontier' the same way you would a so-so episode of the tv series. on the plus side, laurence luckenbill is a fine actor and gives one of the best 'guest star' performances in any star trek, big or small screen, ranking right up there with william windom's commodore decker. his portrayal of sybok, spock's half-brother, consistently lifts the film when it threatens to sink, which happens all too frequently. charles cooper is good too as the fat old klingon general korrd; too bad his role isn't as large as he is. if the story about shatner's intentions is true, then i owe him an apology, because i was prepared to lay the blame for the incessant silliness and not-very-convincing action scenes squarely at his directorial feet. the reason is i've always felt that, of all the trek regulars, shatner was the least 'tuned-in' to everything that makes star trek work and what makes it special to its fans. having read his trek memoirs, it's very apparent to me that he considered the show another action-adventure series that just happened to have a science-fiction setting. he preferred the vision of gene coon over that of gene roddenberry; coon was known for his work on the popular western series, 'the wild wild west.' shatner also mentioned that a favorite star trek episode of his was 'a piece of the action,' a silly second-season episode co-written by coon. so, finally given an opportunity to direct a star trek feature film, would not shatner follow his instincts and produce an action-filled flick with lots of tongue-in-cheek humor? well somebody did, because that's what 'the final frontier' ended up being. shatner himself definitely returns to form as the great ham and, as leonard maltin points out, the film suffers from a bad case of 'the cutes.' in the opening scene at yosemite national park, it's hard to say which is worse, the super-cheesy special effects or the godawful dialogue. running gags about equipment malfunctioning on the enterprise have run all the way from 'wrath of khan' and by this, the fifth trek movie, have run themselves into the ground. so has the idea of a 'skeleton crew'. one new development is an apparent romantic relationship between scotty and uhura and suffice it to say one does not exactly sense flames of passion burning between the two. it's a pointless subplot and adds nothing. the climactic scene where 'god' is encountered doesn't add much either; whether or not this was a good idea in the first place is debatable, but the scene itself doesn't make much sense. (the 'god' creature's abilities seem to vary according to what is needed at the moment.) roughly half of this is a tired retread of the climax from 'the search for spock.' leonard nimoy manages to salvage spock's integrity, even while spouting such un-spock-like lines as "get a grip on yourself, doctor." and deforest kelley, as usual, outperforms both shatner and nimoy; he really came on as an actor in the final trek films. so this trek outing isn't terrible, it just isn't very good. there was to be one more original cast trek movie before the baton was passed to the 'next generation,' and it was far better suited to the task than 'star trek v: the final frontier.'

the voyage here is a search for god, the big guy in the sky, the big cheese with a beard. cunningly disguised as the thirst for ultimate knowledge. taking over from leonard nimoy in the directing chair is the shat himself, captain tiberius william shatner kirk. in an attempt at blending the fun corny aspects of the series with sci-fi histrionics {klingon dialogue consultant, really?}, shatner and his co-writers have only achieved what is almost an embarrassing parody of a parody. where's the danger,? where's the brothers in arms spirit,? in fact where is our badly underwritten crew?. star trek humour is a wonderful thing, when it's in the right places and done with a straight lace so befitting what has come before the final frontier. some light moments exist, but they do not compensate for the lack of serious moments. while do we really need another spock revelation,? really?.some nice sets and little knowingly trek moments aside, the final frontier is just a bad movie experience. 3/10

the rap, the book this movie was 'based' on was one of the most difficult books i've ever read. yet i could not put it down. raunchy, crude, foul, lewd...you name it, it had it. it also had some of the best characterizations of any novel i've ever read.well, as for the flick...it was deplorable. i mean, tim mcintire as wasco? wasco was the baddest mutha...talking 'bout wasco...mcintire as wasco is like casting tim conway as charles manson.what happened to the main character in the book? little arv. he doesn't even exist in the movie...fast walking was not the main dude in the book. why even name credit this thing with the rap? none of the spirit, atmosphere, nastiness, or drama of the book was captured in this movie.for me it was not only a disappointment, but a total waste of time and celluloid.

i was quite impressed with this movie as a child of eight or nine. the gangsters seemed very real and threatening to me, and i could see why people would have been afraid of someone like dillinger. seeing it as an adult, it seemed almost comical, owing to the overdone narration and jarring details like thirties gangsters driving cars that looked like they were from the fifties. there is a certain gritty, unglamorous reality to the way the criminals are portrayed, but the overall effect is more like a bad soap opera. the most memorable and most unintentionally funny bit that sticks with me is the scene where ma barker and her sons are shooting it out with the fbi and the sons are killed. the narrator says something like " perhaps in that moment, for the only time in her life, ma barker became a real mother". this is meant to be a moment of great tragedy and pathos, as ma finally realizes how she's destroyed her family out of her own greed, but instead, it provokes laughter. a very odd film that is rarely shown anywhere these days. gangster movie buffs might enjoy it, but more as a curiosity than a real movie.

apparently re-cut episodes from the gangbusters tv show on the big screen. while this was frequently done in the 50's and 60's because people didn't have a tv or a color tv and producers wanted an increased return on their investment (big screen ticket sales or if it went to the small screen resale of a series that isn't in syndication), the results were usually less then the sum of their parts. the only time i've ever seen it work were where multi-part stories were put together (ala rocky jones or man from uncle) or in the case of horror anthology (the veil and 13 demon street). here the effect is to have stories of american criminals in the 20's and 30's (dillinger, pretty boy floyd, bonnie and clyde, etc)inter-cut with each other as a narrator talks about how the fbi hunted them down. its a weird concoction that doesn't quite work because its clear that there are things here that don't belong together. more than once i looked at the tv oddly because things didn't seem right. in fairness i won't describe the cheapness of the production since this was what early tv (and the series) was like. its not bad, but its not very good either. to be perfectly honest the episodes of the series that i've seen work better a single episodes where we're not expecting as much. given the choice i'd rent dvds of the show instead of this movie.

i caught a screening of this at the true/false documentary film festival in columbia, missouri, and i was pretty disappointed. i was expecting a cool documentary into the protest and activism surrounding the rnc, but what i got was a largely flawed, bad-acted, fictitious, conspiracy ridden badly woven tale. i'd heard of its neo-documentary technique, "blending both true and false" but i expected more along the lines of a fictitious storyline developed for a better personification and to create a sense of unity between real interviews, but it was more along the lines of a terrible made-for-conspiracy theory tv movie.the acting overall is terrible except for rossario, which is not surprising considering the director at the screening said most of the lead characters had no acting training, his excuse being that he wanted them to be real. heres a hint, real people can't act, but actors can usually act real.it would of been not so cornily offensive if it wasn't blatantly obvious about how keen he was to push this extremely radical conspiracy theory onto us throughout the whole movie, its especially hysterical when we get a scene where the director cameos and starts ranting on about ridiculously stupid theories and secret agendas. the movie also does a good job of laughably stereotyping every single role, it tries so hard to romanticize these street activists and stamp a big 'good' or 'evil' on every character.skip it, maybe find yourself a nice real documentary/

i know we shouldn't expect much from a low-budget indie film. but the idea behind it is sound: an attempt to open america's eyes to the cozy relationship between the government, and the journalists that are supposed to be keeping an eye out against it. but somehow the documentary aspect of it, takes away from its drama. the protests during the 2004 republican convention in new york were not that compelling to make a documentary about it. those kinds of compelling protests belong to the era of the 1960's.it would have been better to stick to a drama format. perhaps a slow build-up where the young journalist's eyes are gradually opened up to the conspiracy.

this has got to be the worst show i have ever seen. i always liked chuck norris in films, but why do we need to make these shows politically correct by adding a black side kick who is as threatening as shirley temple in little miss marker. i also thought the show was limited because how many times can you kick a guy in the face and make it interesting. i know an african american who looks like this trivette guy and he gets his butt kicked about once a week he is all attitude.chuck norris is the man and he deserves all the kudos he gets, i think this show started great but lost steam as time went onthey should have dumped chucks side kick

i'd never thought that i would be caught saying this: but i think "dog the bounty hunter" is more entertaining than this 90's era cop drama. walker is very melodramatic and actually set a standard of the genre of "high octane" cop shows such as csi, csi: miami, and so forth. i'm not saying all these shows are bad, but they aren't good either. i like the karate chop action that walker dispenses on the enemies of justice, and the diverse cast of characters as much as the science tech of the csi series. but there are some elements that i hate in a show like this. stereotypes/countertypes! that's right, stereotypes/countertypes! unfortunately, this is a show for the moderates of red state america who refuse to part with the old prejudices of yore especially when it comes to crime. for example, there was an episode in which a kid with psychic powers ventures into dallas where he encounters group of kids in goth/punk clothing and they start harassing him. now! this is exactly what middle america perceives the goth/punk culture. i mean come on, how often do people that dress like that rob and steal from people just minding there own business. whenever there are blacks and latinos in the plot it's always about gangs in some impoverished neighborhood. okay! not everyone who's a minority is a desperate recruit of a gang surrounded by crime, drugs, poverty. again, this is what middle red state america sees of these people. finally, why is the trivette the bumbling sidekick, can't you make the sidekick an equal ass-kicker?

this series is formulaic and boring. the episodes are the same thing every week, simply with slightly varied settings. some purely evil character does some dastardly deed, walker goes after him, and it ends in a karate match. the villains are super-cliché super-stereotypical evil villains, the good guys are all pure, honest and saintly, and the story lines are simplistic and unrealistic. after about 2 episodes, the show becomes totally unwatchable by all but the least discerning fans. certainly not norris's best work. his other work may be cliché but it usually does not drag on for weeks. if you enjoy formulaic,boring, repetitive clichéd snooze-fests, then this is for you.

walker texas ranger is one of the worst shows produced in the past 10 years. the script for james 'jimmy' trivette, walker's sidekick, is about as pathetically written of a part as wesley crusher on star trek tng, and is played with about as much conviction.on this show, people don't respond the way people respond to things in real life--everyone is polarized--everyone is either a completely good guy or a completely bad guy (unless walker himself has a 2 minute talk with them and then they change instantly). that's not how life works, that's not how people are. this show doesn't take place in this reality.the plot lines are about as realistic as murder she wrote, a show where an arrogant old lady can just walk into people's houses without them getting angry, and she can demand that police officers do what she wants and they bend over backwards for her. with walker, everyone on the show, including the "bad guys", act like he's the sort of hero that myths and fairy tales are made of, and time itself bends to his whim. the lines that sometimes come out of people's mouths on this show are beyond ridiculous. it's as if the scriptwriter for the part of wesley crusher (for the "serious" parts) and the scriptwriter for bob saget's funniest home videos (for the "humor" parts) got together and wrote all the scripts for this show.this show is for people who think that good always prevails over evil. it's for the elderly. it's for wishful thinkers. it's for people who want to be guaranteed to always have a happy ending. it's for people who want to drift away into oblivion. it's for people whose drug of choice is their television.i cringe every time i see even a commercial for this show. my opinion is that it is the worst show to be on television in the last 10 years.i used to like chuck norris, but this show has forever tainted him in my mind. i can't even watch his older movies without thinking of this show.

this tv show is possibly the most pathetic display of crap on tv today. horribly predictable, obscene usage of slow motion photography, cheesy story lines. chuck norris is an abomination who should never have been allowed to be filmed in anything. the way he chooses to make each episode into a public service announcement is really annoying. his acting sucks so bad that it makes a person cringe with embarrassment. i will give the series some credit though...it does get entertaining at times, but not enough for it make any difference. with all the negative points this series has, i still prefer it over reality tv, it can't really get any more worthless than that.

this show is the worst show ever! norris and his family write it, produce it, direct it, etc etc. the only reason i ever see it is because my goofy wife likes it. how many times can norris fly though the air from plain sight to land a kick on an obviously blind villain? no trees, no building, just whoosh.....thin air. he always solves the case or is the best at whatever skill there is. no co star ever gets the glory. its all norris. its truly apparent that norris is awful stuck on himself and will not allow anyone to one up him in any scene no matter what the content. terrible acting, terrible script, terrible series.

poor diane arbus (whoever she was). not only was she (according to this movie) a spoiled-but-sweet-acting upper east side brat, she was a bad wife, bad mother, awful business partner; plus there is no evidence in this picture that she was any kind of an artist -- except in the bold statement in the prologue.nicole kidman, who incredibly is more attractive today than 25 years ago and actually looks younger, indeed gives an excellent performance; but what can an actress do with a wife and mom who seeks out and falls for an incredibly weird werewolf-looking guy living in the apartment upstairs? set in the early 1970's, manhattan was a virtual magnet for freaks and weirdo's of all sizes and shapes, most not looking like human hairballs; so why is this affair worthy of a 122 minute movie?robert downey jr used to be one of my favorites, but i'd say his well known and prolonged use of drugs has taken its toll. one might think he'd be disinclined to be in a movie that treats drug use as casually as it does smoking cigarettes. fur has already taken a beating at the box office, but in view of those who input a score of 10 for this misbegotten slice of trash, i'd like to say, 'taint so, mcgee.

bizarre. this movie is supposed to be based on a famous photographer, but everything that happens in this movie is fiction. i guess it tries to explain why diane arbus had a fascination with oddities and made it her primary photography focus. in the movie, wolfman moves into the apartment above hers. she seemingly becomes obsessed with him and falls for him. she puts her kids and husband second over the wolfman, and even tries to incorporate him into her family gatherings. some of the wolfman's freak show side kicks come over to visit and she mingles with them. the whole thing is very bizarre.final verdict: nothing memorable. there is just something weird about a woman who gets her jollies from shaving the wolfman. i think you can find better films out there.

i could have liked this if i didn't like diane arbus.didn't really capture arbus unique visual aesthetic(as stanley kubrick did in "the shinning", with the twin girls in the hallway, a direct homage to one of arbus most famous photos, and one with haunting qualities none of this movies images have), and certainly none of her character(outgoing), likeness(thin and jewish, not wasp queen kidman), or life, save some very superficial similarities, she was a fashion who later photographed "freaks" and "outsiders", among many things. this film focused on the "freak", as her symbol for artistic and personal empowerment, in a really shallow and predictable fashion. outside of that, it might have been an interesting movie about middle class fetish, but i was too annoyed to care.perhaps if arbus name had been left off, this might have been less annoying, but had it not had her name in the title there would have been nothing to make me interested in seeing in this in the first place. a letdown from "secretary".

as an early representation of the turmoil of the 1960's that followed, diane arbus (nicole kidman) can be excused as an early flower child. the film itself deserves no such latitude. the lack of character development, motivation and justification for the character's behavior makes the movie very disappointing. i sat watching and waiting for some explanation of the bizarre actions only to find that shainberg was letting me peek into a story that must have been someones inside joke. that the few facts presented did not match diane arbus' life very much did not help to clarify things either.the washed out art direction in diane's 'normal' life was nicely contrasted with the brilliant colors in her 'awakening' life with lionel. and the trap door stairway was a nice demonstration of diane's attempt to inject her new life into her existing family (however, i don't see how that trap door in the ceiling of her dining room could directly connect to lionel's apartment which was two flights of stairs up from her's).maybe my analysis is a little too literal in looking for some character development and relationship understanding that goes beyond one sentence or one comment. i also would have liked to see at least one of diane's photos as well. i won't wait for the sequel.

i don't know how this movie has received so many positive comments. one can call it "artistic" and "beautifully filmed", but those things don't make up for the empty plot that was filled with sexual innuendos. i wish i had not wasted my time to watch this movie. rather than being biographical, it was a poor excuse for promoting strange and lewd behavior. it was just another hollywood attempt to convince us that that kind of life is normal and ok. from the very beginning i asked my self what was the point of this movie,and i continued watching, hoping that it would change and was quite disappointed that it continued in the same vein. i am so glad i did not spend the money to see this in a theater!

skeletons in the closet takes the father-teenage son genre to new levels of low. this is a movie that serves no purpose. the plot is layed out in the first few minutes, there is no suspense, the characters are cliché and despite plot twists that try to confuse and obfuscate, everything plays out exactly as you think it will. halfway through the movie i could no longer stand the snail pace and started fast forwarding. the movie ended exactly as i expected. linda hamilton is great as always and the other actors are above average considering there seems to be a complete lack of direction. if you really believe you need to see this uninspired lackluster wannabe whodunit, watch it on fast forward.

this movie was so predictable and poorly acted. i really can't recommend it to anyone, not even for unintentional laughs. it is just plain bad. it is pure tv movie hell, the cast doesn't seem all that bad, but they act terribly. just stay far away from this movie and rent something more intellectual, like porn.

i have to admit, that out of the many many thriller movies i have seen, this has to be one of the worst. i was shocked to discover that this piece of work had a 1.5 mil budget. when it started, i thought that the opening sequence was pretty good, fairly standard for this kind of film, but pretty good anyway. but as the film progressed i began to feel distinctly uncomfortable with the lack of pace that i was seeing, each sequence seemed to take hours. the reason for this could have been that by now the film had already bored me to tears, nothing was happening other than endless accusations peppered with confusing flashbacks and the occasional fit of bad temper. well ... after wading through what felt like a lifetime of these scenes we finally reached the big finale...an all singing, all dancing demonstration of how lack of imagination can completely ruin what could have been a good film.overall i found this movie predictable and tedious and i would not recommend this film to anyone other than those people i personally dislike, but if you have a couple of hours to waste and you want to watch a thriller that is not even remotely scary, this is the movie for you.

this is a below average martial arts films which is worth watching for the comedy value due to the part where a pair of symbols are used as weapons. thats it really there is much to say about this film it lacks in every department because the martial arts are not that great either and with all movies of this type the dubbing as bad

"this film is great! i watched it with some friends and we thought it was proof that a film doesn't have to see commercial success to be a hit!" ...is what i would love to be able to say about this film. in the words of the film itself "you are very very bad!" i went to see an unlicensed acupuncturist once so generally agree with the moral of the film though.i'd include a spoiler, but the lack of plot makes this very tricky. overall, a cinematic disaster.quotes; 'you're not a leper at all!' 'you're beautiful, and i bet you're nice too' 'have you ever seen a naked man's body?' 'you couldn't break a piece of straw.'cameos in dubbing; micheal cane x3, harold bishop, steve erwine, benjamin netinyahoo, yoda.

around 1980, the name godfrey ho was attached to a series of low-comedy action films starring an actor with the unlikely name elton chong". although no masterworks of the genre, they remain surprisingly entertaining films for those with a high tolerance for silliness.it is altogether unclear why ho (or whomever) would want to make a film that would attack jackie chan's drunken master, the film that legitimated the making of comedy-action films in hong kong. but that's what this is, a savage attack on the chan film (the imitation chan who stars in this movie learns to cause his opponents to laugh themselves to death - a pointless gimmick in any genre).along with all the flaws one expects from a godfrey ho film of this period - no continuity, no motivation, incomprehensible plot line, irrelevant and unbelievable characters - the film suffers from two unforgivable faults that effectively make it unwatchable: the fight scenes stink, and the comedy isn't funny.pointless.

i took my family to see barnyard this past weekend. we had so looked forward to it but had my kids not been there, my husband and i would have left. coming from a farming community we found the fact that all of the male bovine in the film having udders drawn on them was a little disturbing. we felt like we were watching cross dressing cows or something. it was just odd to hear a male voice come from a female body. after checking some of the production notes on a different website, i felt like the animators might have slipped up on this fact. i know this is just an animated, humorous show but by putting female body parts on a male, i had to suspend my disbelief so much that i just couldn't enjoy the movie like i might have. i know udders can be found funny but they were definitely over used. none of the other animals in the movie seemed to have gender specific body parts drawn on them and i would have preferred the bulls in this show to at least have the correct ones if they had to be drawn on at all. the kids however still enjoyed the movie though we took the time afterward to make sure they knew the difference between bulls and cows.

...i normally hate puns, but this seems the only appropriate summary for "barnyard". i suspect i am not the first. and i'm sure many, many comments focus on the idiocy of bulls with udders. it certainly bothered me right off the bat. but there's much more wrong with this movie than a fundamental lack of knowledge about how mammals work.personally, if i was a parent, i would be irritated by the violent turn it takes near the end in the showdown with the coyotes. (although for me, it at least injected a little action.) and from a conventional screen writing point of view, you might expect the coyotes to play a greater role in the conflict(gee- you have a "widow" cow...maybe her "husband" was killed by coyotes? nope...there's a much dumber explanation.) and what kind of a farm is this? otis vows to protect all the animals from harm, but there certainly seems to be no threat from humans. they make reference to the farmer being vegan, but what is he raising pigs for? in all children's animal stories- babe, charlotte's web, you name it...the reality of farm life is at least touched on. perhaps our friendly farmer is running some sort of rescue shelter (there is some reference to this, but it's never explained.) but all the farmer gets in return is abuse from a horse in a scene that is supposed to be funny, but left me seriously wondering if he was going to wind up buried in a shallow grave behind the barn. and what the heck is the deal with "wild mike"? it was like the gimp scene in pulp fiction without the ball-gag.add in some truly awful attempts at emotional scenes, a nearly complete lack of laughs, and those udders, and you've got the worst kids movie i've seen in ages. i generally only post to imdb to highlight a film that's not so well known- not to slam the current #2 box-office hit. but this movie angered me. it was taking up space in my local theater, space that could have been used to show something worthwhile. there's been plenty of good family entertainment this summer- in fact there were at least 2 more kids films playing at the same multiplex. but i'm not allowed to see something like "little miss sunshine" so viacom can cheat families out of an extra $30. at least i had a free pass.i know that as a 35 year old with no children, this film was not designed for me. but there's just no excuse for such a lazy, dreadful children's film as "barnyard" in the age of pixar. i was bored by the "ice age" films, but they certainly didn't anger me like "barnyard". "shark tale" was a weak attempt at street hipness, but it had quite a few laughs. for that matter, you could turn on nickelodeon at any time of the day, and see something more entertaining and intelligent- which is why they should be ashamed for putting their name on this garbage.i'm giving it a 2 out of 10, only because pip the mouse was sporadically amusing, and maria bamford had a few amusing lines as the farmers wife. well, not the farmer's wife. some other farmer. they didn't really explain who she was. they didn't explain a lot of things. especially not why sam elliot- the ultimate "man's man"- had an udder jiggling around down there. creepy.

barnyard sucked! i saw this movie last week and it is horrible. what bull has udders? my 2 year old was asking me if all cows have udders and trying to explain to her that this is simply not true and seeing the movie only confused her more! in addition, the violent theme scared my 2 year old. they made the coyotes ferocious looking and this has instilled a fear of coyotes into my daughter. i know coyotes for a fact are not ferocious and are natural predators. the mother and son who were sitting in front of us were shouting, "kill him, kill him, yea" in a particular scene in the movie where good vs evil per sayit is a lion king rip off and they should stop using big name actors for a lame movie. steve oederek who has also done thumb movies, such as thumb wars, thumbelina and many others are so so bad!if a good steve oederek movie ever comes out in my lifetime, i will roll over naked and swallow my diarrhea and post it on youtube.com ...enough said!

this movie seemed like it was put together very quickly in both plot and graphics. my two daughters were ready to go 30 minutes before the end of the movie which rarely happens when we go to the theaters. this was a nickelodeon production and it would have been better if they had released it on the t.v. station. the animation itself in some parts was o.k. but the plot was horrible. a classic tale of a son trying to fulfill a fathers expectations is used in a lot of kids movies, but the animation or graphics need to be really good to keep a childs attention. this was not the case with this film. there were also awkward elements between the lead male character and the lead female character that the plot could have done without.

when my six-year-old fell asleep at the theater during this movie, that was all the confirmation i needed that this film is a stinker. it was boring. the scary parts were boring. the maudlin parts were boring. even the funny parts -- with two minor exceptions -- were boring. and predictable. and did i mention predictable? examples: 1) the gruff but loving dad indulging his brat of a kid. 2) the gruff but loving dad buying the farm (while singing a song?!). 3) the brat of a kid deciding to cut and run, but, thanks to his friends, sticking things out because they need him. 4) the brat of a kid winning against incredible odds. 5) and a sassy character voiced by an african-american actress. gotta credit these filmmakers for that bit of originality and for perpetuating that stereotype. i did mention two funny bits. in both cases, contributed by minor characters. the mouse bouncing on the farmer's pulse was funny. the farm dog falling victim to his doggy weaknesses while vying for leadership was funny. but the rest? painful. someone tried to make a hipness-thru-committee movie and make it even hipper by making it a computer-animated film, and this was the result. and why make the coyotes batman-villain dumb by monologuing with their victims, rather than just eating them? oh yeah. no blood needed in this film for kids, already concentrating on mock alcohol consumption, destructive behavior and potty humor. and the fuzzy thing-in-a-box? just what exactly was it? a porcupine? tasmanian devil? what, besides a really stupid plot device to help otis the cow win the mother of all battles? barnyard is a bomb. and i didn't even need to mention the udders.

hey! the grudge 2! what up, man? i have a friend i would like you to meet. the grudge 2 meet johnny's worst of 2006 list. johnny's worst of 2006 list meet the grudge 2.what's going on here? i was under the impression that this was supposed to be a sequel to the grudge rather than a remake. if that's the case then why does it do nothing but rehash the original? this floater doesn't even feel like a movie. it's just a 90-minute soundtrack of the weird contortionist chick making that annoying croaking sound.a sound on which i'd recommend you not get me started. it was kind of creepy the first time i heard it, but i've heard it about 12,367 times since 2004, so it's pretty much run its course. and it's made even more annoying by the 20 people in the audience who thought it'd be funny to imitate the sound whenever there was a quiet spot in the movie. sigh.folks, you're not funny so just shut up! i promise you, every single time that a character was walking slowly through an empty room (which is approximately 97% of the movie), somebody in the audience would start it up, "uhhhhkkkkkkuuuuuhhhhhkkkkkk." yes, i know that's a horrible way to replicate the sound with letters, but you get the gist. so then some dude in the audience would giggle, and not to be outdone, deliver his own rendition. i was very close to just walking through the audience and punching random people.i told you not to get me started.there's absolutely nothing about the grudge 2 that i can recommend. there's not a single original scare or idea in the entire film. there's not one memorable acting performance. are you a sarah michelle gellar fan? welp, enjoy her two minutes of screen time and one line of dialogue. are you an amber tamblyn fan? i hope you can deal with the fact that she's given nothing more to do than walk around looking like she's suffering from a pinched nerve. can you believe the story (if you can call it that) is even worse than the grudge's? at least the original was fairly creepy and boasted a few effective jump scenes. i didn't jump once during this lametrosity (yeah, i made the word up, deal with it). that's right. not a single time. the "scares" are so manufactured and they are so blatantly telegraphed that there is absolutely no shock value once the "gotcha" moment arrives. watching this movie is like playing a good game of chess - you're always four or five scenes ahead.there are also some weird scenes thrown in that make no sense whatsoever. one that immediately comes to mind is a scene where a girl drinks a gallon of milk and then begins to regurgitate it back into the jug. huh? i say huh?!?! the audience laughed. i shook my head and sighed. there was a lot of that during the movie. laughing. sighing. head shaking. falling asleep (i did twice).the movie even makes a 1/5th-hearted attempt at a plot "twist." wow. it's so bad that i don't think we should even dignify it by labeling it a twist. did they really think anybody would be surprised at the revelation of who was hiding under the hoodie? please. it was as shocking as elton john coming out of the closet.and of course the ending goes the whole non-closure "look, we might have another sequel" route. as soon as the credits rolled the audience booed. my sentiments exactly. had the audience paid money for this turd burger then things would have most likely gotten violent, and i would've gladly led the charge.we learned from the grudge that there's a japanese belief that when someone dies in a powerful grip of rage, then a curse is left behind. much like a ben affleck movie, it's a "stain" that forever becomes a part of the place where the death occurred. well, in the grudge 2 we learn that when a horror movie covers its budget during its opening weekend then its sequel will be rushed out, and more often than not it will be as bad as this and will leave a stain on any theater where the movie shows.the gist if you're a total wimp and never saw the grudge then this might provide a few cheap scares. but i strongly recommend saving your money, otherwise, there's a good chance you'll be the one walking out of the theater with a grudge.

what a tedious turgid boring mess. this is a classic example of all that is wrong with contemporary english theater & film. about as exciting as a closet full of dirty socks. the very opposite of living film. only the presence of joanne whalley gives it any spark.

i finally rented this video after searching for it for many months. initially i only wanted to see it because i'm an out and out neil pearson fan (patrick, boyfriend of isobel, the lead). however, the movie stands up very well without neil (although he handles himself very well in this movie, he is overshadowed by the three main female characters). it's an eerie, intense movie, the sort the brits do so well - definitely a "chick flick" the house and it's isolated setting giving the movie an almost "wuthering heights" aura. the movie is full of tension and the ending, shocking, yet somehow inevitable. i'm glad i watched it, it was worth the wait

there's nothing new in this movie. nothing you haven't thought about before, nothing you haven't heard before. the story of a gay man who is brutally murdered in a small town and the reaction of people can be broached in many ways, and this movie has chosen the most demagogic and slushy one. one of the biggest flaws in this movie is that it isn't neither a movie nor a documentary. the director has used the transcriptions of the original interviews and made the actors play them as if it was a movie. the result is weird. and finally, i read in previous comments that stated that people who don't like this movie are anti-gay. i'm pretty sure this comments come from people who consider themselves tolerant but don't tolerate that other people don't like this movie. this is a funny world.

this film infuriated me for the simple fact that it was made only because shepherd was gay. the men who murdered him are clearly wicked. what happened to the poor man was truly horrible and a tragedy. however, where was hollywood when four religious white kids were executed, after being forced to perform a host of sex acts on their killers and each other, by two evil black men in wichita just two years ago? the celebrities only mug for the camera when it serves a political purpose. also, laramie is portrayed in a poor light by this pseudo-documentary, which of course is hardly surprising because they are the backward hicks who must be educated by omniscient and enlightened californians. still, it's always a treat to see laura linney.

throughout this movie i kept thinking why on earth did they make this as a "documentary," yet not include real footage of the people who were interviewed? sure, it would have been just like any other documentary, but then it would have been up to the film makers to find the meaning for the movie to deliver.using a host of well known movie stars (many of whom apparently asked to be in it) to portray "real" people gave me the feeling that there was a pre-determined message to be delivered, and the director was so intent on it that real people couldn't be trusted so actors and rehearsed scenes were used. (yes, i know this was also a play, but a documentary should be a documentary.) i really found myself getting put off by the various stars, and kept expecting one of them to drop character for a moment and say "i'm a good person because i'm in this."this movie could have had a much more powerful social commentary had it been more objective or let us see matthew shepard and his murderers as people rather than symbols. (the much superior "boys don't cry" had an unflinching view of those involved--good and bad.) instead the laramie project gives an almost relentless lecture that someone's sexuality should be accepted regardless, and little else.

this screened at sundance last night to a receptive if mute crowd. clearly the story is worth relating, it's powerful and true, but did the director have to cast every single role with a recognizable face? i mean, really, you spend have your time saying "oh look, it's the guy from 'armageddon'", or "hey, it's easy rider!" and you lose sight of the story. perhaps it's the only way this guy could get his movie made, but it's a little distracting, sort of like 'the love boat", or those old towering inferno movies, that were 'chock o' block with stars!'. i wish he's just told the story simply with less famous faces. also, the camera work seems kind of lazy, like there wasn't any thought about where to put the camera to best tell the story. all in all, i thought it was okay, but could have been really good.

i was in this movie as an extra in the dallas filming in july 1975. some of the things you see today,and take for granted in movie making, were implemented in this movie. the movie premise, the costumes, the special effects, the acting. it all was ahead of its time. it opened the door for movies such as "star wars," the "terminator," the "matrix," and "x-men" movies. now people look at it and they say, "well this does not add up to this new special effects story..." it did not have any computer graphics and such as the new movies do these days. it did have a story, and a wonderful cast, and a hell of a director! the places it was filmed like the dallas' world trade center, and the zale building,and the ft. worth water gardens were at that time the most modern and futuristic backdrops in which to film. the director michael anderson was very creative and he tried to show a perfect future that was flawed by human desires and frailty's. it was my first film experience, the first of six films i have been in. just because it was filmed in texas does not make it any less a wonderful piece of filmmaker's art. watch it again and appreciate it more. this movie was the foundation that set the standard for many great films that we now enjoy. well, my hand is blinking... i got to run. santuary awaits...

everything this film tried to do is done better - and superbly in "run lola run". the red haired hip cutie, the critical deadline(s), the lover in jeopardy, and the "crime pays-sometimes" message. but, unlike "lola", it just isn't believable or well put together. it is a labored knock off that might have worked for me if i had seen it before "lola" - but it pales in comparison. yes! the falling beetle was nice! but that was about the only surprise in the film. do yourself a favor and see the real mccoy - (and the real hip red head!) - in run lola run!

help, i've ended up in cinema hell! what a completely stupid film this is. really nothing is good about it. let's spit it out:1) the story is incredibly far-fetched: an anti-eu terrorist group is chasing a bunch of guys who drive around western europe carrying a delivery of see-through bags full of xtc pills. and the worst thing is: they are serious about it!2) the level of acting should put great shame on all faces involved. 3) some money-eyed guy decided to let every one talk english so that the international market would catch on. ugliest advertising ever! the french and dutch native tongues talking smart make all but sense and the result is laughable. 4) the soundtrack is totally misplaced and ill-chosen.5) the camera, edit and effects work is supposed to be of some post noir road movie kind of style, but is hardly worth some thing and not meant to accompany this story (read: anti- story).6) hidde maas. the hero of wildschut never fails to convince. a true actor. usually i would give an extra point just for the sake of him being around. but no, sorry, not this time, i would just not forgive my self...

if this movie is coming to a theater near you, consider it a threat. i was unfortunate enough to see this movie here in tokyo. since i'm dutch, i was surprised to find a dutch movie playing in a metropole like tokyo is. i figured it had to be somekind of special if a dutch movie makes it all the way to japan. so i went there with some friends, and we were happily telling the theater's staff that we were dutch and that we were so curious about the movie. as it turned out, this was one of the most infantile, silly, dumb, worst acted, with worst spoken english movie i've seen in maybe 10 years, and i left the theater trying to avoid the staff, because feeling almost responsible for this disaster movie. sometimes you get the feeling you know what the director was aiming for: lola rennt, trainspotting kind of like movie. instead it was more like macgyver on drugs with outdated breakbeat music as a score. but if i wasn't feeling too annoyed, the movie was unintentionally quite hilarious once in a while, as it showed holland at its smallest.

this is a road movie. at least the movie is in yellow anf i think that suggests a road movie (?). i can't say much positive about the delivery. it's bad acting, certainly their english. camera looks like it is done by a kid, there's a bomb with counter, and suddenly a beetle is falling from the sky. since it was so cliche we actually laught the whole time -- and that was the most fun of the movie. this movie should be released in america, but i'm not sure you should go because that might suggest that is the quality we produce. the explosions look boring. basically everything is over the top. everything is just too much: the yellow quality, the sound, the babe, etc. find all the cliche part in other movies, put them together and you have the delivery.

i was looking forward to this movie. i like road trip thrillers. i like sex, drugs, youth, action and a great sound track. and i was especially interested in taking the movie trip across europe to see if i recognized any of my own travel spots.from the first scene, however, this movie was unwatchable. what was guy doing driving on the wrong side of the road? what could possibly have blown up the van that rolled gracefully down a shallow grassy incline? if they're such bad drivers, why would they take a delivery job? and that's just the first scene! not even bad enough to be campy or silly. just horrible! horrible! horrible! waste of time. move on to something... anything else!

i'm just filling this comment out, because i couldn't stand the fact that a positive comment was featured on the "complete information" page. i really think this to be the worst movie ever made in my country. this is not only because of the terrible plot, the crappy english and a tension-curve that is as flat as our country. no, it is because this was a serious attempt to make a good action movie, conform the hollywood standard. it had to be "the european action movie of the year".for this purpose they even hired fejda van huet, actor in the academy award- winning picture "karakter", to do the job. i don't mind bad films, i can even enjoy them if they are pretensiousless b- movies. but i can't stand movies that are terrible, but supposed to be a-type movies.

i really hoped for the best with this one, but it just didn't happen. financed at a very non-dutch manner and still looking great, with a style and pace that's very much like hollywood. what i don't understand is how-with all these great benefits- the director,writer,producer still managed to make this film a completely horrible picture to watch. filled with bad jokes, cheap nudity and actors that just can't really talk [act] in the english language. kudo's for pulling it off, but what was this guy thinking!

contain spoilers! these guys are total scam, they did the lost scrolls of judas, saying judas was a huge friend of jesus... and now this? this is clearly a tryout to destroy a religion, and should be illegal. they have no proof, it could be clearly a setup. how can we know and trust these people? what if they carved the tomb and "said so"? and at the end they seal the tomb forever so no one can go there investigate? how stupid they think we are, really? are we supposed to trust that they are trustworthy people? who really found a tomb of jesus? and how can you stab all the christians like this? i think this documentary should never be made by a non religious man. it can only be made by a christian and i mean the direction and script. it should be illegal for jews to film a christian related documentary, specially if the documentary makes accusations about jesus not being a "son of god who resurrected" (nothing against this, they could be buddhists or atheists, anything but catholic).to me this is a total hoax, a pure documentary-scam. they sealed the tomb so people "wouldn't" think about checking things out. this documentary is a total failure, how stupid they think the christian people are? and what about the lost pages of judas... that was a total scam as well, they seriously said at the end, something like: "we know a few people that could do a fake scrolls just like these, and no one would know it was a fake"... oh my god, they just said it.. "dude we might have done these"... this kind of documentary should be illegal, it is a stabbing on all christians and catholics they should be behind bars!!! i am not a fanatic, i am an ex-jew, now atheistic, but i have valors and will always respect others people religion, the part when israel orders the tomb to be sealed forever was precious!! precious!!

the theatrics and the drama included in the movie is fantastic, but the facts and the research is far from solid. when quoting dr. bovon, where the documentary tries to establish a connection to mary magdalene from mariamene, dr. bovon later clarifies it should be used for literary purposes (ie: fables of that time) not for a historical figure. in fact he states, he does not believe the mariamene ossuary in talpiot is mary magdalene. he further comments on his public letter, that he was not informed that his words would be used for this documentary but rather for information regarding acts of philip (a literary work in the 4th century).so what we have here is a director that took one clip for a 4th century acts of philip fantasy and used it specifically to support a 1st century ossuary inscription. a very sad stretch and dr. bovon calls the jesus/mary magdalene connection as "science fiction" -- as this documentary should be rightly labeled.

this glorified discovery channel documentary, part biblical study, part treasure hunt, all misappropriated, might have sat well in it's television origins but falls flat as a feature film. right from first glance of it's cheesy looking cover art, one may cast doubts upon the integrity behind this serious subject, shown on front case relegating the search for jesus's tomb to a generic action font that looks more national treasure or tomb raider then any informed debate and examination of the historical burial site should. such is the underhanded way in which the entire proceedings revolve.more curious child then worthy researcher, simcha jacobovici's explorations come across as self-indulgent while his research comes across as manipulative. for all the fascinating revelations this filmmaker tries to impart on his viewers through supposed evidence, a flood of repetitious statements reiterating the same research and findings over and over proves the lost tomb of jesus has very little information to back up the bloated, albeit entrancing claims. what this amounts to is a very frustrating attempt to beat the audience over the head with the same small factual evidence in support of this tomb's authenticity, which ironically detracts from it. while tirelessly linking together many of these mini-coffins found together to support the jesus of nazareth theory, this research forsakes a well-rounded approach to continuously pursue this romanticized archeologist's singular obsession. there may be some impressive factual data which helps shed some light on many traditional dogmatic christian-held beliefs, but essentially the shady nature of this project made it come across as merely an exploitation piece, financed at a time when the da vinci code was all the rage.in the end, the cheesy cover art was right. despite my appreciation for documentary form, the lost tomb of jesus takes an always interesting topic and turns it into overlong and unvaried geriatric adventure hunt, substituting any relevance and sacredness for the uninspired motivations behind this team. by the time these tomb raiders have finished their explorations, reluctantly having to stop research because of social demands, viewers are left with the sense the director was insistent on forging this mystery whether it was there to begin with or not. there are a few genuinely potent moments where the halls of history come marching through this documentary in unassuming ways, but all the decoding, exploring, and theorizing in the world still left this misguided vanity piece in an uneasy void of apathetic response.

this film was strongly recommended by a friend and, being a great fan of brando, i ordered this film from harrods and eagerly waited for it to arrive. i have seldom been so disappointed by a film. brando was good as a german officer but the rest of the film was simply unbearable. you never get to like or care for any of the characters (except brando, maybe). the acting was ok. story, what story? maybe that's the point. it's war after all, but i've seen far better war films. (lawrence of arabia, apocalypse now, even star wars) it was so boring i kept checking my watch...overall this is one of the worst films i have seen. please don't waste your time and money on this. may i also add that this is the first user comment i have written, i just had to let my feelings about this film known.by the way, my all time favourites are: casablanca, the godfather 1 &2, one flew over the cuckoo's nest, pulp fiction and amadeus. if you haven't seen them yet, please spare the time to do so. and amadeus must be in widescreen 2.35:1

after the book i became very sad when i was watching the movie. i am agree that sometimes a film should be different from the original novel but in this case it was more than acceptable. some examples:1) why the ranks are different (e.g. lt. diestl instead of sergeant etc.)2) the final screen is very poor and makes diestl as a soldier who feds up himself and wants to die. but it is not true in 100%. just read the book. he was a bull-dog in the last seconds as well. he did not want to die by wrecking his gun and walking simply towards to michael & noah. so this is some kind of a happy end which does not fit at all for this movie.

this is a fine concept piece and the acting by brando is a fine piece of work. dean martin isn't bad and montgomery clift is quite good as well. unfortunately, it's a very disjointed, very long piece that really should have been edited down to something closer to 2 hours (it's almost 3 hours). we follow the lives of 3 men from 1938 through the end of wwii and watch as they discover who they are and what they might become as they discover both the world about them and what they're made of. for some, it's the women in their lives that brings about this realization, for others, it's the broader general circumstances. all too often however, i found myself asking what had just happened or what the import of a particular scene was.

this is a textbook example of how hollywood didn't (doesn't) trust moviegoers, and panders to its big name stars. the character of christian is completely re-written, the anti-semitism noah faces from his own army unit is virtually eliminated, michael's story is changed significantly, and the end result is to decimate the power and terrible beauty of the book. i almost wish i hadn't even seen it, because of the ability of movies (sounds and images) to resonate so powerfully in your brain; i would have much rather just been left with the impression of the book. the book could have been written today, it is that honest and brave. the movie, neither. my advice: skip the movie; read the book.

films like this infuriate me simply because they don't deserve the funding that enables them to end up in my dvd player. this movie is ambiguous in its jacket blurb and even more impenetrable in its casting choices (why is ms. song a romantic interest? did they just want an asian woman in there, or does her unconvincingly wise character actually lend this "message" movie's story a fresh perspective)? one has very little to go on in approaching this film, and even less as the story unfolds. but a good hour into the proceedings, i realized the dull casting is all the casting agent could dredge up, the unconvincing character studies are the result of writers' brain-fart, and the story is amorphous and plagued by unsubtle references to the woes of capitalism, materialism, and getting ahead in the postmodern world. towards the end of this film, just before i nodded off and missed the last two minutes, i got the sense that "everything's gone green" is a product of "connections" in the world of film - someone with very little talent knew someone with very little directorial skill, knew someone with absolutely no marketing sense (but plenty of disposable ego) and out popped this dull and inefficient attempt at whimsy and humor-with-a-conscience nonsense. and this is what is most maddening - how many infinitely better scripts were passed over in favor of this almost unwatchable tripe? skip this film, and feel good about yourself for doing so.

i liked some of the characters, but our lead relied too heavily on a charming smile. i didn't care two whits about him. he makes bad choices and i really didn't care since he did not seem to either. he seemed rather unintelligent. there were a couple of moments that provided a chance at some human insight (the scene with the whale was interesting), but these are lost in the general malaise of the film. the love interest was acceptable and the other various characters were mildly interesting, but the plot meanders around too much and left me wanting at many points in the film. in the end, i wondered why i stayed so long.there are some tepidly humorous moments, but ultimately i did not care. i cannot fathom rating the film higher. - 3 of 10

i saw bits and pieces of this on tv once, and when a friend recommended it, i began looking for it even though it seemed no place nearby had it. i finally got a hold of it in an antique store, and couldn't wait to watch it...oh, that i had seen it a couple years earlier and could've really enjoyed it. i was surprised that this movie was only 80 or so minutes long, and i think this is what made the plot and story so lacking. the plot really does sound like a good one, both on the trailer and the movie comments: a teenager, angus (jesse bradford) and his newfound stray lab yellow are marooned on an island during a storm on a boat trip with his father (bruce davison). together, they manage to survive the wilderness and wait to be found and rescued. still, what is never mentioned is that everything is shortened and the events of the plot are very rushed. there is a possible love interest between angus and sara, but they're never shown together for more than a moment. yellow is a mischievous dog the parents are reluctant to keep, but in a few days he seems to be appreciated enough to join a boat trip. the scene of the mother (mimi rogers) mentioning vaguely what death is like to the younger boy (joel palmer) doesn't go anywhere. in no time, we learn that 9 days have been spent on the island, then suddenly it's 14, then 19. of all the animals a castaway could be exposed to in the wild, only 1 kind - a wolf - attacks them. why couldn't something else have been a problem instead of having the same type of animal - maybe even the same one - strike twice? there are few views of how angus prepares food, except when he discovers fruit and roots, and when he roasts a trapped rat. if he knows so much about survival skills, why weren't more scenes with it shown? the one thing that made me blank was why the dog didn't have much part alone. when he is rescued, and the dog is left behind on the island, there is no scene showing how he survives without a human's help. i wished i was more open to this when watching it, but i did enjoy some of this. the acting was good, and the score was enjoyable. though, i found myself wondering why the father looked so much older than his family, and why he and the main search and rescue conductor share names. this is a good movie for kids, but though the protagonist is 14, nobody over 10 would be interested with this.

'book ii' isn't a film, it's a sermon. this nauseating, sickly and almost unbearably tedious misfire probably works as religious propaganda but has no entertainment value beyond a few wisecracks from george burns. louanne plays a little girl who is asked by (ahem) god to mount an advertising campaign that will get people to believe in him again. no really, that is the story. it's a leaden load of old cobblers that has far too much self-justifying, 'explanatory' religious waffle but barely any decent dialogue and certainly a total absence of anything even approaching magic or charm. 'miracle on 34th street' this ain't. suzanne pleshette breathes a bit of life into this rancid puddle of quick-setting concrete but the pudding-headed script and rubbish performance by the irksome louanne quickly send this one down to the fiery depths of you-know-where.

oh,god! book ii is more of a bad remake of the original than a sequel to it.it is not all that funny,its plot plays too muchlike a rejected situation comedy pilot,and the use of the slogan "think god" is a different variation on the idea that worked so much better in the original.john denver had not returned for this movie and that made a big difference.george burns,aswonderful as he was playing god,does not have the same chemistry with the little girl that he did with john denver.i would give this movie a rating of 3 out of 10,but only forgeorge burns;the rest of the cast is nothing special.if you loved the first one,don't bother to see this one.

george burns returns as the joshing almighty after enjoying a big success with 1977's "oh, god!", an upbeat fantasy made successful by a sudden need in the 1970s to switch from devil-driven thrillers to comedic redemption (although it made money, the original was more in line with the "topper" comedies of the '30s than a return to feel-good religious cinema). here, god appears to a young girl (louanne, who had earlier starred in a stage production of "annie") and asks her to spread his divine word, causing her nothing but trouble from grown-ups in the process. peculiar, family-oriented film appears to be warm-hearted enough, and burns gets to chime in with a nice barrage of wry jibes, but the writing is half-slapstick and half-seriousness, with the adults of the piece considering putting little louanne away, all of which makes god seem more like a troublemaker than an elderly friend. louanne is another problem: a perky kid with wizened little eyes, she is untrained for screen-acting and occasionally seems awkward. the medium-budget production has a gloppy, tv-movie appearance, with few graceful touches. the final scene mimics the climax of the first "oh, god!" in that it brings a wistful sentiment to the mix, which is welcomed. it's the most subtle moment in the movie. ** from ****

grim instead of amusing, mean-spirited instead of playful, boring instead of interesting. it won't give you "the willies", but it just may gross you out or send you to sleep. and it will certainly make you wonder: "what were they thinking?" (*1/2)

the willies starts late one night as brother's josh (joshua miller) & kyle (jason horst) are camping outside with their cousin michael (sean astin), they decide to pass the time by telling scary stories...first up is michael with a story entitled 'bad apples' in which a young boy named danny hollister (ian fried) is bullied at school, however the sinister new janitor mr. jenkins (james karen) decides to help him out...next up is kyle as he tells a strange story called 'flyboy' in which an overweight bully with a worrying fascination with dead flies gets what he deserves in a horrible twisted way...written & directed by brian peck the willies didn't do much for me & i doubt it'll do much for you either. the script is strange as far as episodic anthologies go, instead of the usual three or four stories it only has two main tales & a few bizarre 'urban myth' type mini scenes at the start, these consist of the person who orders food from a fast food restaurant only to find a dead rat in her chicken, a man who dies of a heart attack on a ride & someone who tries to dry her poodle off in the microwave only for it to explode. i have no idea what the purpose of these scenes are but they add nothing to the film, as for the two main stories they are both weak. for a start they are too long which is a huge mistake in these types of films, usually the stories in anthologies are short, sharp & quick with a nice twist at the end usually involving people getting what they deserved. however in the willies the stories last for the best part of 40 minutes each which is longer than the average tv episode & i must admit i found both stories very boring, they have very little going for them & seem to be aimed at children. the first story is the better to watch as a whole but it has no twist ending as far as i could see while the second one has a nice 'just deserts' ending but the build up to it is weak & drawn out for no good reason. i really like horror anthology films so the willies comes as a disappointment, frankly it lets the genre down.director peck was obviously working on a low budget & as a whole the willies is pretty tough to sit through, there's plenty of continuity errors & it's poorly made. there's no atmosphere, there's no scares, there's no gore, the special effects are poor & it features unnecessary shots of a dirty toilet several times. overall it's a pretty unappealing film to sit through.technically the willies is rough around the edges to say the least, the effects are far from special & it has an extremely drab & grainy look to the picture. the acting is poor, no ones going to win any awards thats for sure.the willies is a poor film, it's not scary, it's not fun, it's not entertaining & it only features two overlong stories. definitely not recommended.

if this is the best commander hamilton movie, i have no curiosity about the others.a movie actor's greatest tools are his eyes, but when peter stormare wants to show great emotion, he closes his, so for five or six seconds we get to admire his eyelids while his feelings remain unknown behind them. lousy acting technique.stormare also flinches sometimes when he fires a gun, turning his head away and clamping his eyes shut. watch carefully. james bond can rest easy with competition like this.there are some interesting supporting performances from other actors, but not enough to hang a whole movie on. the cinematography is good-looking, doing a fine job of capturing the nordic cold. even the sahara winds up looking cold. perhaps hamilton carries his own climate with him.there are some individual good action sequences here. unfortunately, the only sense of humor on screen belongs to the villain, which turns the hero into a big pill. james bond's jokes may not be particularly good, but at least he doesn't look constipated all the time.one positive point in the movie's favor is that the psychotic, contorted, vicious hatred of israel in guillou's books has been left out. what has been kept in is worship of a noble, heroic plo, that he shows us functioning in libya without the dictator khaddafi's knowledge or supervision. this fantasy is hard to believe, since khaddafi actually threw the plo out of libya for four years at a time. and at the end of the film, hamilton gives the plo a very disturbing gift. where will they use that gift? hamilton doesn't care.we're a long, long way away from "for whom the bell tolls" here.commander hamilton will remain a local phenomenon. while henning mankell's books sell well around the world, jan guillou will never have the same success.as for this film, bleeeeaaahhhhh.

another example that we should stay away from trying to do spectacular action movies in sweden, it doesn´t work, except for widerbergs still unsurpassed mannen på taket. stormare does the best he can, i suppose, and some scenes are mildly effective, but the plot is full of holes. why does hamilton continue the attack on the base, knowing that his wife is held hostage? it was fun to see mark hamill, but his bad guy-part was very underwritten. i´m constantly amazed that relatively big swedish movies like this get made without a sensible, functioning script. 1 out of 5.

this movie changes its way a third of the way in.its totally pointless boring and stupid.i hated this movie so much that i will never watch it again.some bad films can be really funny. this is just a british art house picture that should never of been made.1 out of 10

i am still not sure what the hell this movie is about. i guess the boy was afraid of becoming blind and began imagining all sorts of strange things. this does not explain why he wanted to kill his new baby brother , however , or the unrelenting boredom found within this film. while watching this movie you will wish you were blind so you did not have to see this experiment in futility. skip this steaming pile and opt for anything else at the video store ..... anything else.

well,there isnt much to say about this movie. its simply trash. very poor acting, poor script, and lame story.... well, the actress,(i odnt even know her name) who played mainrole,(not the blond one,but latina one) was acting fine,but the blond one who played the friend of main charactor,,,her acting level is just like highschool play,so as most of other actors in the movie. also,zombies,,,,very bad acting as well. and,,the story itself has really no point at all. well, if you are really bored and really got nothing to do,but wanna kill time somehow, maybe you may wanna watch this movie,but eventho,there are still millions of better b movies than this crap. its total waste of money and time.

very simply, they are all the syndicated episodes and not the original uncut/unedited nbc episodes. it is not the complete first season, all eps are edited to conform to 21:00 for syndication meaning jokes are cut, an extra commercial fade is included, all of the harvey korman intros are not here...very poorly done! shame on a series i've been waiting for....booooooooooooooooo! if you're a true die hard mama fan, don't buy this and go to http://www2.warnerbros.com/web/main/help/whv/customer_service.jsp and send them comments on why we're unhappy on this butcher job to a classic sitcom!

this guy is a real piece of work. an angry, immature boy in a grown man's body, packing all the charisma of a rock, he goes around to places most people would only wish to visit and does his best to be as miserable as possible.give this job to someone else who actually appreciates it.i could go down an endless list of all the stupid things this guy does in his "episodes," though i'll just highlight the worst: crete. while the locals are putting up seaside picnics in his "honour," this clown has the gall to act like a petulant, spoiled child. he complains about everything, including the fashion sense of the people who live there. what an imbecile.when he went to sweden, he spent at least five minutes feigning incredulity at a bunch of chefs (who probably had better things to do than talk with some dimwit american, like work) because they didn't think abba was horrible. everywhere he went, he brought up abba. this is the kind of talk you'd hear from 13-year-olds who watch too much mtv.when he was in new orleans, he got upset that a certain restaurant had better-tasting fries than his, so he "accidentally" spilled some wine on them in order to ruin them. what a strange, emotionally unstable person.the worst of it all are his clumsy voice-overs, where he attempts in vain to add some kind of perspective on a situation he was too thick and ignorant to appreciate. he tries to use all these "big" words in order to sound like an author, but he's really just a pretentious hack whose lack of awareness has convinced him he has something to say. that, by the way, is probably the one good thing about this joker's tv show. it goes to show you, no matter how inept you are, as long as you take yourself seriously enough, the world will as well.then there's the way he speaks with local guides whose english is obviously only rudimentary. he'll use vocabulary any writer--as he believes himself to be--would instinctively know will most likely not be understood by these people. does he care? no. self-important schmucks like this bourdain clown do not use language to communicate; they use it to make themselves look important.mcg13jthm's review on this same page is a perfect example of the kind of mind bourdain attracts--that of a low iq social misfit. observe how the reviewer attempts to justify bourdain's sociopath nature with simple-minded, childish excuses that hardly make sense. "bourdain may complain but he goes through 'a lot' and, not only that, he was 'forced' to do this show but is trying to redeem himself." a dolt attracts dolts, and reading mcg13jthm's review should let you know perfectly well whether or not you are the kind of person who'd enjoy this utterly useless, pointless show.finally, to add a bit of "fairness" to my diatribe, i admit bourdain would have been momentarily amusing had i met him in a bar. but as a tv host of a travel show whose purpose is to show the viewer the beauty of other places and cultures, bourdain is a miserable, abject, hopeless, grim and depressing failure.a failure.

a man wonders if his hunky co-worker is gay. at a yard sale he finds a ray gun called "gaydar". you point it at a person, pull the trigger and it tells you how gay they are. he tries it out, it works and he sets out to find out if his coworker is gay like him...promising idea ruined by an unfunny script (after a promising beginning) and terrible acting. the entire cast overacts and basically scream their lines at each other constantly. it gets annoying and really embarassing after a while. the saving grace is that's it is short, there's a scene stealing cat (love her fall out of the kitty bed) and charles nelson reilly is hysterical in his brief bit. but none of this saves the movie. i can't recommend this at all.

the fun that was present in the other 'movies' has all but disappeared with this third effort, which means the rubbishy production values show through more than ever. another 2-parter ('the chinese web') cobbled together, this one suffers from too much padding, not to mention weak spidey action taking place in such uninspired locations as a car park, apartment and printing press. nicholas hammond is as endearing as ever, struggling valiantly against the drab production and lame performances of the rest of the cast. the plot, in which peter and spidey help a chinese official defeat charge of corruption during world war ii by locating three marines who could testify as to his innocence, doesn't exactly scream 'comic book sprung to life', does it?

the film starts out great, with a mock instruction film about the habits of swedish housewives. after that we get a detailed reconstruction of post-war scandinavia with lots of amazing cars, electronic equipment and interior design; a minimal jazz score, nice cinematography and stylish titling. also there's some funny scandinivian rivalry like in von triers 'riget'.sadly, after the set up, "kitchen stories" collapses like the twin towers on 9/11.actors who try to portray the emotion 'jealousy" by just staring in front of them. corny dialog filled with stale gay symbolism in the vain of: "i don't like white swans, i prefer bears and wolves... u ever tasted bear meat?" the music becomes cheesier than yann tiersen at his worst.it's a pity the director put all the effort in this great set-up, just to screw it up after-wards.

first, let me mention the fact that, in spite of its title («stories», in plural), there is only one kitchen story. as to whether isak died or not at the end, i'm not so sure since, in one of the very last scenes, his pipe is seen lying on the table next to the two cups. on the dvd cover, there is a reference to tati. it claims that the film is «très drôle: rappelle tati !» («very funny: reminiscent of tati!». the great jacques tati relied mainly on mime and silent deadpan attitudes to achieve his comical effects and to offer his critically satiric views of his 1950’s french «modern» society. of course «kitchen» does take place during the 1950’s and it does offer some (rather faint) satirical references to the absurdities of bureaucracy and there are some long moments were no words are uttered -– but they are not really funny. are all these small details enough to make «kitchen» a «tatiesque» movie ? this being said, i have to admit that «kitchen» does deal with the sometimes false objectivity of scientific research versus the «truth» of human subjective emotions. generally speaking, the movie was agonizingly slow, with nothing much happening -- with barely any «dramatic impulse» : the involving parts were the set up during the first 15 minutes or so, and during the last half hour or so. indeed, the last segment was -- finally !!! -- interesting and moving. it might seem that it was a short subject, of less than an hour, unduly stretched to some 90 minutes. now, about the set-up (a «scientific» observation on the behavior of single males in their kitchen): at first it seemed very promising –- with the charting out of the comings and goings of bachelors in their kitchen as a means to determine what new inventions would be most useful to come up with. but very quickly this premise turned out to be just a prologue, an «excuse» to introduce the real subject which was only fully developed towards the end and which was about loneliness and the invaluable bond of friendship. pity ! i honestly wanted to like that movie. yes, it seemed so promising when i heard about some of its unusual little «anecdotes» -- which were indeed there and which i enjoyed -– such as the burning of a man’s nose hair (instead of using scissors to cut it off), the «investment» of having a huge quantity of «valuable» black pepper stacked away in a barn, the role reversals (the observant becoming the observed), a man’s mouth emitting sounds from a radio program. and there is also a sick horse becoming the catalyst of half-hidden human despair, the relative importance of right or left side car driving in sweden and norway (a reflection of the importance for each of these very close neighboring countries to affirm its individuality ?). am i the sole person who did not fully enjoy that film ? does this necessarily mean that i'm wrong ? perhaps it’s almost generally praised «fine points» were, in fact, «too subtle» for me ? perhaps... could my individual views on this movie ironically reflect the very essence of the film itself -- which would be the vital necessity to have the right to differ, to affirm one’s individuality and not to follow blindly society’s trends and opinions ? each one of us has the right to have different personal views and not to be a slave of the demands of one’s bread-winning «dictatorial» demands: often, we do have other alternatives that would allow each one of us to be useful to our society while respecting one’s inner principles. in short, being true to oneself -– the way that in that film folke (isak’s «scientific observer») ends up by giving up his job while preferring to stay in his new friend isak’s house and help his out with the tasks of his farm ... and so, «vive la différence», as the french say !

is it just me or the fact that the evil racing team is japanese and that their arrogant star racer is german seem a little over the top? maybe that is how it is on the international racing circuit but if all america had representing them are chumps like cody and his mechanic chris (peter berg, who must have been still learning how to act) then i would be rooting for another country. formula movies can be good but the characters have to be likeable and no one meets that criteria in this movie. to put it succinctly - a very bad movie.

what a dire film. i cannot believe that i actually sat down and watched it. a very, very, very, very, very, very pathetic effort, with no redeeming features whatsoever. hateeeeeeedddd ittttt! the so-called "racing" sequences are laughably awful, and the plot was so bad, i've forgotten it. part of the film was made at the spa-francorchamps course in belgium in, i think, 1988, during the actual grand prix there. i was there and am glad i didn't appear in any of the paddock scenes shown in the film. it could have been good...what a pity.

i love the book. it's full of passion, romance, tension... and the movie drags along taking two spunky stars with it. kylie minogue was already a major star in australia, having starred in neighbours and releasing her first single. the decision to cast her in the delinquents was surely a marketing ploy. for me, it didn't pay off.kylie may have been great in neighbours, but she was far too sweet and innocent to play the feisty lola... and, she wasn't of asian descent as lola was. charlie schlatter was an excellent brownie, but there was no chemistry between him and kylie.by and large, the movie was boring. it dragged on, it lacked the passion of the book, it focused heavily on kylie and in general, was completely disappointing.

i was living in barstow ca. in 1968 when the movie the killers three arrived at the local theater. the trailer was enough to get me to pay my hard earned money to see this movie. i was really expecting a bonnie and clyde movie and i got dick clark playing a shy nerdy guy while robert walker and diane varsi played an poor attempt of reinacting bonnie and clyde. needless to say it never went over well. maybe this is why it never made it to video. even as a kid i was left some what ripped off as i left the theater. after all the best parts where in the trailer of the movie. the movie was dull and pretty much pointless. by the way, dick clark gets killed so it wasn't a total let down.

this film was shot in randolph county in central north carolina in 1968 when a film crew in the state was a rare thing. the locations were the municipalities of liberty and ramseur and the surrounding rural countryside. it is not a particularly good movie. it did have merle haggard and it brought life to the hinterlands for a few minutes.the plot is standard shootemup. the cinematography is that fuzzy stuff that came out of the late sixties and early seventies. the local folks were thrilled to be a part of the enterprise.if viewers have difficulty finding a copy of this film, a record copy is available in asheboro, nc.actors not credited include ben jones, mimi pravda, tommy hull, bill nunnery.

i am shocked by all the good reviews on the cover of this movie and on imdb. it belongs in the $2 bin at your local video store. to say that this is a b movie is extremely generous.besides lacking a single redeemable character, only slightly better than average acting, and an ugly 80's style picture quality, the script for this film is dull and lifeless. this film is not only boring--it is pathetic. (admittedly, there is occasionally some mildly interesting chemistry between the two main characters.) even the final plot twist--rather, the only plot twist--does not save this film.rent "diamond men" if you must, but do not hesitate to turn it off once you become appraised of its worthlessness. 2 out of 10.

man alive, is this game bad or what? the graphics are way below par, even if it were on a playstation 1, never mind a gamecube. the gameplay is pathetic and the camera movements disorientating. what a worthless game!i totally love warner's batman animation and it's cool that they do all the games in this way. batman: vengeance could well have turned out great as they got off to a good start by keeping all the gothic visuals and voice actors but they seriously stumbled when it came to playability and graphics. the result is a boring game that looks incredibly cheap and is no fun to play whatsoever. i really must stress how bad the graphics are. don't let the color schemes fool you. i've seen better stuff on a commodore 64.

was the cast and crew on drugs before they started filming this? there was a hole in the plot...so big...nothing could have filled it up. from the first scene when the co-star is late for dinner, was there any doubt where he was and what he had just done? the suspense was over from there. now, it was going to take another 85 minutes before the mystery was solved. i must confess that the biggest hole in the plot kept me awake for hours, wondering how dumb the screenwriter, the director, chrisian slater, molly parker, and stephen rea could be not to at least explain how our murderer, who was not a lawyer, or a policeman, could go into a locked cell at a jail, kill his second victim, and tie him up from a noose to make it look like suicide??? i kept wondering if i had fallen asleep out of sheer boredom and missed how that happened. if someone can explain it to me, please do...and then, why, for god's sake, did he kill the third victim? nothing made sense...and yet, someone thought this film was worthy to be an official selection at a film festival. perhaps it was a comedy and i failed to laugh.

the story is shortly about the faith-lacking business man priest, daniel clemens (christian slater), who is looking closer on a case where another priest is suspected for murder. the priest denies he's guilty but at the same time he is not able to discuss the matter due to confidentiality. enter daniel clemens who starts playing cop...while the plot isn't ridiculous, everything else is. let's start with the visual side, the cinematography is dull, it looks more like a tv-series than a movie. the camera angles are boring, in fact, there's not a single memorable camera angle in the entire movie. there's no interesting closeups revealing details. and the scene transitions, well, there's not much to say about those, they aren't smooth at all, there seems to be no connection between the scenes than the actual plot. okay, they did use a transition with music in between two scenes, but there are no interesting visual transitions in the entire movie, the times dissolve was used there was no visual connection between the scenes.the boring visual part could be forgiven if the film would offer anything else. unfortunately the film only offers forced wooden acting and clumsy dialogue with no punch. on top of that the film suffers from audio problems, the sound volume is lowered several times in the movie as if the microphones would be too far.i didn't predict the solution of the film. it could be because the film never gave me the opportunity or it could be due to the presentation, which was so boring i never even tried to figure it out.put two plus two together and it equals a b-movie where 'b' stands for boring.

isn't it depressing how the most violent cartoon on cartoon network is aimed at girls? while i'm not watching soldiers getting shot and blown up on saving private ryan or band of brothers, it would be nice if there was a cartoon or at least something on tv i could watch to satisfy my violent urges. and something that i would not get made fun of for watching. i did see some episodes (i should really be shot for this) and had to sit through the movie (now, where do i find a gun?), and it is quite clear that this lost its spark after the first few episodes. if you like seeing 500-foot monsters that can destroy huge cities in seconds getting slaughtered by toddlers about one foot tall, this is a must-see. but it does get very boring after a while, and with a show like this, even original ideas become chiefly dull. the movie just felt like one overlong episode (i can't remember any of it), and the villain should have been far more intimidating than a green monkey. this show is a laughing stock. it churns out the same basic premise episode after episode after episode, and though it may try to have some mystery and intrigue once in a while, the ending will always be the same - "the powerpuff girls save the day!" all is good and nice, but all is very, very repetitive... i give it 3 out of 10 for being the only danged cartoon on cn to revolve around violence, although it is aimed at girls, so i won't be tuning in for it ever. i've established myself as a fan of war and violence films and i won't have that reputation destroyed... 3/10

when i first watched this show on cartoon network, i found it uninteresting. then i read a lot of good messages about this show, and i decided to watch it. the show was so boring. each episode was predictable. more, this show has no logic. hypersmart girls, who are going to school and sometimes do such stupid things, 99% of episodes start with a monster attacking townswille, then mayor (he is a real fool, he is not funny, he is so stupid, that i can't imagine how he became a mayor). professor, yes, supposed to be the smartest person in this show, but actually... he even found no difference between monster and his brother. narrator's comments also make this show boring. because they also have similar lines in the beginning of each episode and in the ending. also the animation is very strange. everything except main heroes is shown in an ugly way. also in every epsode this show is giving you some life-lessons, and it means that it is oriented on little children, but if you look closer, you will see, that there is a lot of violence and even blood(!!!) during their battles.

this movie is so daring it doesn't attempt to hide its similarities to the shining. it lacks the originality to do so. and when it does, near the end, try to cover up its story of "father goes psycho under influence of sketchy haunted house in a foreign place," it does so by stooping to plenty of other already established conventions and ideas. in other words, it reduces itself to mere cliche. but hell, even i enjoy a good predictable horror or thriller as long as there is an interesting story, one filled with violence and gore, somewhere before the film makes the dreadful turn towards the predictable and trite. well, this film doesn't have a good story and i was really disappointed with it. what 'darkness' has going for it is remarkable direction and cinematography. it is a film well-shot and carefully constructed full of fun, creepy angles and shots. what 'darkness' doesn't have going for it is pretty much everything else. to begin with a minor quibble - the editing in this movie is obnoxious. it jumps from one scene to the next, sometimes pointlessly. for example, the old man in the movie (who pretty much carries the background story, later filled in by another character) is underscored by a hamster running circles. i mean, it looks cool the first time, but why continue to use the same image? i guess you'd have to see it for yourself, to understand what i mean. another problem with this movie is anna paquin's character who essentially whines throughout the film, crying and caring all too much about everything - she's the film's failed attempt at a character-driven horror film. the movie has scenes of overblown sentimentalism and the family drama it depicts is simply not believable. by the end, 'darkness' is a muddled melodrama, with a non-involving mystery provided with too simple of an ending. and it's hardly scary.

an american family moves to the countryside of spain to live in an isolated house. regina (anna paquin), the teenager daughter of mark (iain glen), who is sick and has some mental problems, and the nurse maria (lena olin), notes that weird things is happening in the house and with her young brother paul (stephan enquist), but her mother does not believe on her. reggie decides to investigate with her boyfriend carlos (fele martínez) the origins of the house, and they find that forty years ago, the place was the stage of the death of six children. reggie decides to ask for support to her grandfather albert (giancarlo giannini) to protect her brother against the house and her father.i bought this dvd expecting to see a good horror movie of haunted house mainly because of the names of anna paquin, lena olin, fele martínez (from "thesis" and "abre los ojos") and giancarlo giannini. further, i like very much spanish cinema. in spite of, i found a terrible screenplay, an awful direction and a deplorable acting of excellent actors and actresses. the intention of the story is good, slightly recalling "the shinning" in some moments, but unfortunately it is badly developed, never being clear, for example, the reasons and motives why the american family moved to spain or the horrible relationship between the members of the family, mainly the situation between maria and reggie. the direction is confused, poorly trying to use dark and shadows to give scary effects to the story. i love anna paquin, but her expressionless face never works in this flick. lena olin is a caricature of the great actress she is; and stephan enquist is too much weak for such important role. only fele martínez has a good performance in his support character. i liked the open end of the story. my vote is four.title (brazil): "a sétima vítima" ("the seventh victim")

when you get ahead of a film, you know you are wasting your time watching the movie in question. that is exactly how i felt while i was watching "darkness." i could see anticipate every twist and turn easily. it is a combination of "the amityville horror" and a myriad of films that deal with the occult. it is so silly that i almost found endearing its naiveness. i cannot say i was wholly bored but i found the film way too derivative for my taste. director balagueró tries to redo his early spanish hit "the nameless," but he cannot pull it off. i admit, a few sequences were creepy enough but i just abhor when i can figure out what is going to happen next. also, i hated to see good actors like lena olin and giancarlo giannini sweat so much over this piece of dreck. finally, anna paquin as the star of a horror film? this must be a joke. she is cute but she is one of those good child actors that have become a very monotonous adult actor. you can live without watching this one.

if you saw the grudge, a another mediocre ghost movie then you should know what to expect, just worse, a lot worse. this time instead of being in japan with all english speaking people we are in spain with all english speaking people. it is interesting that not one shot of this movie actually looks like spain and could have been entirely filmed in a studio back lot. oh and a place with swings, cause there's a good 5 mins of footage of swings with no one on them, oooohhh how spooky.this one is terrible in every way imaginable. the acting by the lameinator mom and dad don't help matters at all. anna paquin is the only person that delivers a decent performance in the film but i hate anna paquin so you can imagine my own private hell viewing this film.there is one good moment in the movie, however, when a villain is trying to explain the convoluted plot to anna paquin's character and she doesn't understand any of it and asks a bunch of stupid questions and he blurts out "you idiot, you have not understood anything!" lol. well i happen to understand this film is a piece of garbage. 0 stars.

horrendously acted and completely laughable haunted-house horror flick that has an out of place anna paquin playing a neurotic teenager fighting off the "things-that-go-bump-in-the-dark" that are plaguing her and her family shortly after moving to their new home in spain(?!). little more than a geographically re-planted rip-off of "the shining" and most notably "the others", the weak-plotted "darkness" is basically your typical run-of-the mill b-horror feature with a few predictable lame scares that can be seen by audiences a mile off (so to speak)! in retrospect i suppose i shouldn't have set my personal expectations quite as high for this movie to actually be good considering the well-known fact that it was shelved for nearly three years before finally being released around christmas of last year in american cinemas across the country to what was ultimately lukewarm ticket-sales and very harsh reviews from critics. when will filmmakers ever learn that there's more to making movies (be it horror or otherwise) than just the fey possibility of a little financial gain? (turkey-zero stars)

this review contains spoilers. i didn't have any expectations about this movie. i pulled it off the video store rack with the movie, "white noise".first, the credits for this stupid movie run about 5 minutes into it. the pacing from start to finish is slooooow. the main heroines don't like to wear a bra and the director appears to enjoy the jiggle effect as anna paquin descends the stairs. if you like movies for boobies, this one has a low level buzz factor.second, it's nice that the movie rips off elements of lovecraft and other horror genre mechanisms, but in better movies, there is at least some rational or consistently irrational behavior. this stinker tries to establish some sense of modernity and reality but then you have situations where no one calls the police even though they've uncovered a treasure trove of potentially incriminating forensic evidence, and otherworldly rituals are nicely spelled out in a comprehensive book on otherworldly rituals like on buffy. i was waiting for miles to show up and give some consultation on how to slay a certain demon type of so and so.the premise is that it is possible to open up an age of darkness where creatures that crawl on the ceiling can cut your throat or turn the meat grinder effect on you. ho hum. to do this you need to have a sacrificial circle and then have seven kids who must have their throat cuts by people who love them. this opens the world to the age of darkness. at least that's what it says in complete detail in the book of ancient occult rituals. which raises the annoying question of, uh, well, how did the ones who wrote the book know, and, if this is what happens, would you really leave this information in a book you can take out from the library, much less get it from a library in a world that is not covered already in darkness, an age brought on by lunatics who could have performed this like much earlier using the "occult practices to bring the world to darkness for dummies, 2nd edition"? it turns out the father in the story is the 7th child, the one that ran away from the ritual 40 years ago; he was released by his father, who is the doctor/grandfather in the movie, who wanted to try the ritual with presumably, other stupid parents, who just wanted to see if dumb sh*t like this opening the world to darkness actually works. the grandpa let the father go because he "didn't really love him". aduh. stupid stupid movie written by a moronic director who appears to think he's some kind of eurofilm auteur. there's also a scene in the movie where the kid appears with big welts on his face and the mother grabs him and has this total lack of reaction. the whole movie is like this. people seeing really weird sh*t going on and not reacting to it in any sort of normal way. must be bad plot and direction.anna paquin does her best to play her character realistically without cracking a smirk, and she does look smashing in a halter top, but at several critical moments in the story, her character doesn't bother to call in for back up. you know, more of the same, "i will walk into a likely demonic evil situation without any knowledge of defense or help from others carrying flashlights or firepower even though i sense impending doom." and even dumber as it may seem, even if you bring on the age of darkness, these creatures who make you bloody can't attack if you have a light source, but they appear as people you know, and tell you to turn off the light source. reminds me of the video game "alone in the dark"; maybe this movie is a rip off of that game's concept.the best actors in the film are the young kid and anna. they both die at the end. the entire family dies. the darkness creatures lead them to their death, but really, the stupidity of the characters in the family was the main cause of death. the other adults could be interchangeable with any other actors from the red shoes diaries series of fine cinema.so to wrap up, the worst things about this movie are the stupidity of the characters in bumping around blindly in an obviously abnormal situation, the really crap plot (there is an old architect in the story who designs a house with a sacrificial altar hidden in it - the architect has suspected from the beginning there would be occult sacrifices in the house but doesn't tell anyone because, well, no real reason, they couldn't find the kids, but he didn't bother to tell authorities about the hidden rooms which he designed into the house but he does like to hang around the house for a 40 year period because he worries about what is going on inside...derrrrh...duuuuh), the hackneyed use of scare mechanisms (more children standing around in the dark or only showing up in photographs, and blood on the wallpaper), and the egotism of the director which when you see him in the dvd features describing his crap work as a new and original rendition, makes you understand where the real horror of this movie lies.is it entertaining? at 2x speed on a dvd player with the subtitles turned on, it can be entertaining, until your reach the end and realize the movie is crap, otherwise it draaaaaaaags on. the cinematic equivalent of a fatty shake; the empty calories are horrid.the movie gives the feeling the director must have seen "the ring" and wanted to attempt to create something similar in mood, which in this respect, the film fails miserably, and so, also, in this respect, jaume balagueró, it is my opinion that you suck at what you do.

what starts out as a passable movie degenerates into one of the most incoherent, unscary, incompetently made, stupid attempted horror films of recent years.absolutely terrible. it's such a derivative mess ripping off every decent fright flick you can think of without successfully producing a single scare. whether it's copying the recent trend with creepy kids or ghosts walking past the camera or the old school horror of fulci's gates of hell.the worst thing is there's not even a cat jumping out of a cupboard to make you jump. to be avoided.

'ernest saves christmas' is comedian ernest's christmas special film. in this film, ernest has to find a successor to santa claus in order for christmas to continue. along the way, he meets a young girl who is a thief and who ends up stealing something very important of santa's (i won't tell you what that is; you'll just have to watch the film for yourself). like most ernest films, there is a lot of slapstick humor involved.this film is probably one of ernest's best films. it's funny, and it has some important lessons to learn regarding friendship and family and not being afraid to show love. it's not the best christmas film around, but it is a good one to get you in the christmas spirit. it's a little bit sad that the film is a little dated now.

this movie started off great; the first 30 minutes are very funny and clever with some interesting characters. that's the good news. the bad news is that the film then gets too repetitive and then it gets downright stupid. what we wind up getting is a santa claus with "magical" powers with a lot of new age baloney thrown in the mix. it's just ridiculous and hardly the kind of "christmas movie" i would expect from jim varney's "ernest."to be fair, it still had a decent amount of laughs and is profanity-free but just not a film i could recommend.

i have seen this movie several times, it sure is one of the cheapest action flicks of the eighties. so, i think many viewers would definitely change the channel when they come across this one. but, if you are into great trash, "dragon hunt" is made for you. the main characters (the mcnamara twins) are sporting great moustaches and look so ridiculous in their camouflage dresses. one of the best scenes is when one of then gets shot in the leg and is still kicking his enemies into nirvana. this movie is really awful, but then again, it is a great party tape!

you know, i was very surprised when watching this movie. it aired during the day once when i was sick, and having nothing else to do, i continued watching. this is by far the worst movie ever! but to my surprise i kept watching. i sat there saying, this is terrible, but yet didn't change the channel because i was so amused at how bad it was. maybe it was the guy that looked like big tom from survivor or the dreadful moustaches and mohawks these characters had, that kept me watching. however, the girls weren't half bad, but if that's what you want, there is far better. oh, and there's "ninjas" and "pajama boys!"so if you like ninja's, bad acting, hilarious(and terrible) dialogue, and two twins who are five feet tall and killing everything in their sight, then this movie is for you. it's so bad it's good. however, i just had to give it a 1 out of ten. i couldn't have put a 10 on it up there with lord of the rings.enjoy!!!!!!!!! :)

this is by far the worst thing i have ever seen on film. my uncle's home movies have more talent in them then this piece of crap.the plot summary is basically that these twin kick boxers are playing some sick survival game with a man and his private army on some island. the man has a very cheap paper maché looking hand.the acting is atrocious in this movie. there are scene changes at the drop of the hat. for instance, for at least 30 seconds we see some guy humming a song to himself which adds nothing to the movie. this has the worst dialogue i have ever heard of in my life, i don't think this movie could get any worse then it already is. i would describe it as a want to be chuck norris action film gone wrong. and i hate chuck norris.

why is it that canada can turn out decent to good movies in every genre, other then action? i caught dragon hunt on tv the other day and it was like a train wreck. i just could not change the channel, it's sheer stupidity sapped my willpower. its pretty telling that the cast imdb "credits" with this monstrosity apparently never worked again.bad acting, bad writing, bad narration, bad music, bad hair, bad cinematography. it just goes on and on. the movie really has nothing to recommend it. if you're looking for bad action films to enjoy by laughing out, there are a tonne of other films that won't require you to scorch out your retinas afterwards.i hope this film didn't get money from the government for financing, otherwise i'm never paying taxes again.

i...i don't know where to begin. dragon hunt might just be the worst film in cinematic history. even anus magilicutty was better than this, as it was intentionally bad. showgirls? no, it had kitsch value and was technically a well made film. but dragon hunt takes the cake, and eats it, then vomits it back up and feeds it to a homeless man. it's that much of a travesty.the acting, if it can even be called that, is rough. it doesn't have the charm of improvised acting, so it must be scripted, but it's recited with an almost malicious tone of poor quality. several lines were delivered in a way that shows the actors (or basically, those people on screen) either regretted being connected to this film or were thinking of a particularly humorous joke from saturday night live, which they had watched prior to getting in front of the camera. i could write another three paragraphs on the quality of acting in this film, but you and i both don't want to hear it.the make-up and special effects (which, with most films, is the only good thing) was laughably bad. the antagonist, whose name is so ridiculous i can't remember it, has a mohawk glued to the top of his head. yeah, glued to his head. and you can tell it's glued on too, if you look at the spot where it meets his pockmarked skull you can see a plastic strip, not unlike the ones on fake eyelashes. thankfully he's pretty much the only example of make-up no-nos in the film.there's also some terrible character development, to put it lightly. the women, who are strangely rough handled by the supposedly benevolent fugly brothers (and i mean, they are really pushed around), are not only ugly but...gasp...they don't know what they're doing! in one scene they turn on their apparent lovers, join up with the even uglier bad guy, and then snort some coke. apparently they managed to get their hands on some really good cocaine, because they started shaking and laughing even before all of it went up their nostrils. great timing girls! plus they wear some truly horrible stuff, clothes that belong solely in the late 80s and early 90s.overall this movie, this film, this waste of film i should say, is also a waste of time. watching it will hurt you, and will require the suspension of not only your belief, but also of your entire brain. if you want to get stoned with your friends and have some good laughs, see if you can get this film (you'll probably have to download it) otherwise, don't even think about it. hope i was helpful.

this canadian "movie" is the worst ever! stunningly amateurish. when the bad guys rob a boat, we see two women with machine guns and one of them says, with a very low voice, "we're robbing your ship!" she blinks and is totally shy! very intimidating. rotflol!!!the two karate chopping heroes are 40something year old, five feet tall twin brothers! they're really bad actors. in fact, everyone involved in this production is a non-actor.there are so many continuity mistakes in this cheap production that it's amazing. in one scene, the guys are wearing one type of swimsuit. in the following shot, they're wearing completely different swimsuits. absolutely terrible! a must see for any fan of bad movies. i have it on vhs. it's very rare. i cherish it.

everything about this movie is bad. everything. ridiculous 80's haircuts. ridiculous moustaches. ridiculous action and fight scenes where you can actually see that the adversaries do not even hit each other. bad, bad, bad 80's music. repeated scenes of people running through woods. a bad guy with a silver plastic hand and silly hair. stupid dialogue. the acting is nonexistant. everything looks extremely cheap. this movie even surpasses "plan 9 from outer space" in its utter badness.it's not "funny bad" it's just bad.

i thought this was an extremely bad movie. the whole time i was watching this movie i couldn't help but think over and over how bad it is, and how that was $3.69 down the drain. the plot was so jumpy. they did an excellent job at the beginning of explaining who dated who in high school, but they never really explained anything after that. was it a supernatural thriller? was it a regular thriller? apparently you can decide for yourself, because they didn't see the need to explain. i understood basically what happened, i think. what i got confused about was all of it prior, what was the deal with the bloody noses, phone calls, etc.? was this guy coming back? was the wife channeling "carrie" or something? who knows? you certainly won't after watching this movie.

...but i would be lying. a relative was a crew member, and we got to go watch the production of this movie for a couple of days (and i was an extra). i get to die and have a second of screen time, not that i plan on moving to hollywood anytime soon. i just thought it was awesome to see how movies are made and be a part of it. plus, i got a copy of the movie once it was finally released. they didn't have a studio backing when making this film so it truly was independent. why the writing and acting is so awful is beyond me, but the main character "cherry" is the director's sister so that could be part of it. but the cinematography was good. :)

i don't mean to sound pretentious here, but to call this the next cult classic is yet another example of the lowering standards filmmakers have for themselves. this movie is an offense to everything we hold sacred, and not in the good "artsy " way of offending. this film becomes the archetype for painful dialogue, delivered by even more pathetic actors.

saw the film at it's lawrence, kansas premiere. this wavering story about a group of disgruntled highschoolers killing off the competition for prom queen was just awful. it fails for many reasons - bad acting, bad script, no clear point. but mainly it just felt like the filmmakers said to themselves - "hey i have some money, so let's make a movie!" - without really thinking it out. sorrowfully most indie films that don't make it suffer from just that mentality. they just don't seem to realize that it takes more than money to make a good movie... or in this case, even a watchable one. with this film i do not feel ashamed to say, that if i didn't know some of the crew, i would have walked out. simple as that.

this is a really really bad movie. that may seem like an oversimplification. a fickle, childish retort comparable to a petty unsubstantiated insult. the truth is, there is not enough i can say about the confusing senseless plot, the really atrocious acting (i'm talking nasty here folks), or the random images of violence toward women that make up the chaotic pastiche of radically horrendous film-making mistakes that propel this affront to all that is good and decent in the world of cinema, nay, human culture. please, take my word for it, don't watch it... ever. i'm serious. stop. you'll thank me for it later.

with pep squad receiving an average of 4.7 on imdb.com, no wonder steve balderson slanders this website so. but the fact is that pep squad is a poorly crafted "black" "comedy" (both words in quotation marks for a reason). it's a movie full of over-acting (cherry, beth's mother), coupled with a couple of lethargic performances (beth and julie's boyfriend). a movie where you can follow cars from twenty feet away in a gaudy red jeep and never be noticed. a movie chock full of not-so-appetizing cleavage and nudity shots that make you wonder, "does the director think this is funny? or clever?" most of all, the characters are so paper-thin and poorly developed that the film becomes quite unpredictable, but probably not on purpose. pep squad can't decide whether to be a comedy, or a drama, or a satire (patriotic music, i get it...). the movie fails at being serious, because the idea of killing for any school position (this being prom queen) crosses the line into insanity (not to mention shots of flag burning and drive-by shootings, a poor attempt at being controversial and edgy), and fails at being a comedy, for all the forced and awkwardly placed jokes (big butt mama, "funky" black principal, and excessive cussing delivered poorly by the principal cast). watching the documentary "wamego: making movies anywhere" only made this film more cringe-worthy, with praise lauded towards it by... the director and the director's father... hmmmmmm. not a black comedy, or anything for that matter. i guess kansas will have to wait.

this movie is a clumsy mishmash of various ghost-story and suspense-thriller conventions, none of them fully realized and all of them rather irritating. the script was perfunctory. the acting, ditto. the scary fx were mostly laughable except for one exquisite seat-jumper moment that scared me even though i saw it coming a mile off. now, explain to me someone why you would need ghosts, and black magic, and arcane ritual objects, and count crapula cg boogeymen, and psychic investigators, and family curses, and irish superstitions, and bowls of milk left out for the supernatural beings, and possessed dollies, all in the same movie? with all that you would expect more than one good moment of horror, but this movie is lame, lame, lame.

this was a letdown in many ways. the location filming in ireland, though quite beautiful at times, cannot save this uninspired flick. greg evigan and alexandra paul, as the married couple trying to get their marriage back on track and who inherit a haunted mansion, just aren't interesting characters. paul, towards the end of the film, becomes incredibly annoying and one wishes she would just close her mouth and shut up, as it seems she is screaming as if it has just become an olympic event! other problems with this film are odd segments that have nothing to do with the core of the film, such as the opening sequence with two cleaning women and the woman in a bed with a severed hand climbing over her writhing, naked body. although the woman is quite adequate doing this it does nothing storywise. one is left thinking the production team needed to pad out a short running time and just tossed in some padding and a bit of t and a. the cgi effects are cartoonish as well and the fiery finale rivals co-executive producer roger corman's much earlier and far superior film the fall of the house of usher in all its ineffective cheapness. any attempt at true tension and suspense, and as a result chills, are thrown out the window in this low budget bust. if you like images of ireland you might find something here but you would do better renting or buying a travelogue. skip this unless you are undiscriminating and think plot is secondary. rent another low budget ghost story(if you can find it) titled the woman in black and see how good and scary a movie can be. this was a wasted opportunity.

given that roger corman attached his name to this production, i had high hopes for this film. corman directed many memorable low budget horror flicks in the 1960's. i particularly enjoyed his adaptations of poe's stories such as `the house of usher,' and `the pit and pendulum' and `the raven' which starred the late great vincent price. these films had solid acting, atmosphere, suspense, strong characterization, intriguing plot development and delivered some chilling moments. sadly, `house of the damned,' for the most part, sacrifices these qualities in lieu of cheesy low budget special effects, gratuitous nudity and mindless gore topped with cliche fast edits and camera angles.`house of the damned' starts off interestingly with some beautiful location shots in ireland, but it's straight downhill from here. unfortunately, instead of spending some time building atmosphere, creating characters we might care about, or building suspense - the director opts to begin running up the body count. after a brief introduction to the lead characters, a young couple and their daughter, the audience spends the balance of the film being bounced from one `spooky' event to another which, in this film, substitutes for coherent plot development. the lead characters are so ill conceived and are so badly acted - the audience doesn't care what happens to them. to make matters worse, the `spooky' events are either utterly cliché or unconvincing due to low tech - low budget special effects. the soundtrack has been lifted from `the omen.' the plot, what little there is, borrows heavily from `poltergeist' and `the legend of hell house,' but lacks any of the qualities which made these films convincing.if you interested in seeing well done haunted house flicks, i recommend you check out classics like `the haunting (1963),' `the innocents (1961) or look into corman's early american international films and pass on `house of the damned' unless you're masochistic or mindless.3 ½ out of 10.rob rheubottomwpg, mb. canada

when i first saw this dvd in a bargain bin for three dollars, i really couldn't believe my luck: a christmas movie starring tori spelling, william shatner, and gary coleman??? needless to say, i snatched it up immediately and considered it a worthwhile investment.the movie itself was just as bad as any movie you'd expect to be combining christmas and the three aforementioned "celebrities." the dialogue was inane, the characters were one dimensional, and carol's character arc was completely unbelievable. the movie itself was a lifeless piece of boring that refused to end and made me feel used as a human being when the end did finally come.my advice: don't watch this movie unless you have to and then only under the influence of some serious holiday eggnog.

it has been a tradition since my first vhs recorder for me to collect several of the incarnations of the old chestnut by charles dickens, and i taped this one and "karroll's christmas" this year. fortunately, when this one was run on the hallmark channel at the ungodly hour of 3 am, i was spared having to edit commercials from it. this was, however, it's only saving grace. the writing was excruciatingly dull with almost no clever scenes to save it from being anything more than a teeny-bopper soaper like beverly hills 90210. in this one, a good man who was cast aside for her celebrity seems the only logical explanation for her transformation into a scrooge-like tv talk show hostess. it wasted dinah manoff who just plays bitch goddess to the other bitch goddess tori spelling (who, by the way, had more coats of paint on her face than some colonial houses) and bill shatner is perhaps one of the few fun things in this otherwise dreary adaptation. some of the best opportunities are wasted like the entrances of the ghosts. aunt marla's entrance could have been spectacularly funny in the hands of a decent writer, but this christmas turkey didn't have one, evidently.tori spelling may be a lovely person, but she has all the acting skill of a mannequin, and that makes for a bad show all by itself. yes, it was good to see gary coleman work again, but the script gives him nothing to do really except roll his eyes and spout truly lame dialogue.and what is most infuriating was that the transformation from scroogedom to tori "sweet and light" is as convincing as a passionate conservative. now, if anyone wants to write the ultimate scrooge tale of a george bush and karl rove, we might have a refreshing change from the usual bad christmas carol clones.i suppose if you're a fan of ms. spelling and/or 90210, this might be your cup of christmas cheer. i'd prefer a stiff shot of scotch and a cold beer to wash it down myself. this one i just may cast away before it is with me here for a long long time.god save us everyone!

beethovan lives upstairs is a very bad movie. in my world history class, our teacher had us watch this movie and amadeus to be able to compare the two composers or something. we watched amadeus first and it was a very good movie, but when she had us watch this movie directly after that, i couldn't believe what i was seeing. the acting was horrific, the costumes were ugly (the little boy's was especially ugly and girlish), and the cinematography was z-grade. my friend compared it to a home movie without the date display in the bottom right corner. i understand this was a t.v. movie from canada and probably cost $10 to make, but please, they could have done better. i have seen a few good t.v. movies in my time, but this was not one of them. the biggest thing that i don't understand is why my world history class couldn't just watch immortal beloved or something. how is it possible to compare composers when given the movie amadeus, for mozart, and beethovan lives upstairs, for beethovan? it's not possible to do that when this is the choice of movie for beethovan. i give amadeus an a- (9 out of 10) if anyone cares to know, but beethovan lives upstairs gets an f (1 out of 10).

no wonder a lot of us hate classical music; and what are the children to think? with "educational" pr like this, serious music will soon slip from life support to the morgue. kids know when they're being talked down to, and this is no exception; why can't someone good do a movie about classical music for kids? i must admit, i enjoyed the actor who played beethoven, he took to the role with enthusiasm and a keen balance of the poignant and humorous aspects of beethoven's character; he obviously did his research. otherwise, this is a third rate rehash of the old abc afterschool special format, with none of the occasional charm those short films had. sorry about the rant, but this is an important subject for young people to know about, and it could have been done well; i wonder if musicians or filmmakers were responsible? either way, the kids are hipper than you think, folks...medtner

this movie was so bad and so cheap and so corny, i found this movie to be one of the most boring slow paced early 80's movies that i have ever seen. i like most 80's cheap horror movies but i would never rent this one again. it just did not make any sense. a family that lives in the woods invites their son, his wife and their daughter to spend time with them for the holidays and during the movie for some reason the mother and daughter- in- law do not get along well. we never figure out why until almost till the end of the movie but until then, all we see is the fact that the mother has some form of esp and the daughter- in- law is having nightmares and flashbacks of a catastrophe of what will happen to unfortunate victims to this "thing" that we have no clue as to what "it" looks like, all we see is a bright light signaling his approach and all we hear is a cheap interpretation of darth vadar voices and a soundtrack stolen from various horror movies. then when we finally find out what and who it is all i did was laugh. this "killer" turns out to be some kind of alien japanese warrior from ww2 who has apparently come back to life to claim the mother and her family. and all the mother does is stand there in front of the living room shaking with her hands on fire or something like she's going into some kind of convulsion. this movie is pathetic! avoid it, it's not even worth renting.

unfortunately this is not one of those movies which at least make you laugh at their unbelievable stupidity. it has no entertainment value at all. it just plain sucks. i don't know where to start to explain how much this movie annoyed me. i think what really takes the cake is the unbearable soundtrack. it sounds as if someone took a simple beat and then, for the rest of it, let a 5 year old child run amok with a synthesizer and taped it. it's really that awful and as if that's not enough, there's not one scene in the movie without "music" (=noise). by the end of the movie, you're either deaf or already cut off your ears earlier. which would at least keep you from falling asleep, since there is nothing happening in the movie to keep your attention. just a lot of bad acting, a few cheap and unconvincing kills, no story at all (it just jumps from one scene to another and you as the viewer can try to make any sense of it) and in the last 30 minutes or so you can witness some of the worst "special effects" ever. it's extremely boring. do not watch this movie! you could do something much more entertaining like staring at a wall or reading the phone-book. did i mention how much the soundtrack sucked?

this was a real let down for me. the original bride with white hair is a great kung fu fantasy film but this one was pretty weak. i didn't care at all for the new characters who unfortunately dominated the screen time and the story wasn't well developed. while the first film was tragic and involving this one was tedious (as i merely counted the time to the end when the ill-fated lovers would actually meet). the action was poor in this one as well. the fights were not choreographed very well and there really wasn't much kung-fu at all. just a few weak sword fights between the highly dis-likable lui and one of lin's henchwomen. lin herself mainly uses a sort of telekinesis to throw people into walls and sometimes her hair, a far cry from the impressive showing with the whip and kung-fu she displayed in the previous film. i still gave this movie a 4 because at least it was fast pace and i did want to see what was going to happen at the end, though i (as most anyone who watched the first one) predicted it would go down the way it did and after seeing it i found it anti-climactic and wished they had either made a proper sequel or just left the story alone. i really recommend the first one but as for the sequel only fans of the genre and those who really want to see lin as the bride one more time need apply.

this sequel is quite awful to be honest. i'm a fan of kung-fu movies and this is by far the worst i've seen. bride with white hair 1 was actually quite good and this is a huge disappointment. bwwh 1 was brilliant in some ways with an unique odd-ball evil bad guy.the couple from the first movie played a small role in this movie. instead the movie revolves around a bunch of uninteresting characters trying to seek revenge on their fallen clans. but there's no antagonist in this movie so the revenge is mute.the worst part to this movie is the kung-fu or lack there of. they literally had a street style knife fight. the character at the end refused to fight because there was lack of choreography.

i made the mistake of watching "dark star" (1974) late one night many years ago. it was one of the stupidest movies that i have ever watched:1. bad acting.2. bad writing.3. scientifically stupid plot. (destroying an entire planet because its orbit is unstable or in the way will only make matters worse: instead of having one large, easily avoidable object, you'll have thousands of smaller, but equally lethal and more difficult objects to track.)4. completely unrealistic characters. a painted beach ball as a space alien? the writers must have been doing too many drugs.not surprisingly, the majority of actors that starred in "dark star" never did anything else. of those that did do anything else, the majority never acted again after dark star. therefore, having dark star on one's acting resume was a death star to one's acting career!

this is a student film and it's a piece of crap. i would use much stronger language to describe it but then the review wouldn't be posted and the world needs to know- beyond any possible reasonable doubt- this movie really sucks.there seems to be a different ruler used when measuring an already famous director's early work. like somehow it was genius that we were just too stupid to comprehend since he finally got it right now today. i'm not buying it. the early movie "bad taste" made by the lotr peter jackson's sucks and this "early work" from another famous director really sucks the same way too. these "early works" are representative of crappy everything, from budget to scripts to actors etc.. it all is bottom of the bucket trash. don't be fooled by the big name.if you like watching a handful of male 70's hippie burnouts pretend they could ever command a ship with the worst special effects you have ever seen- this is your movie.i can't f*37449ing believe this thing won a golden scroll award for best special effects. that is a joke right? or a joke award?if you want to watch what this movie wishes it was rent a season or three of red dwarf you smeghead.

i watched a movie called dark talon, dated 1974. the credits to this movie are exactly the same as dark star, so i'm going to presume it was an alternate title. dark talon was nowhere near as funny as everyone else here states. the acting was lame, the editing slipshod, and overall stupid. at the beginning there's an annoying 1970's trucking song called "benson, arizona" that has absolutely nothing to do with the movie. basically the plot revolves around a small crew of an interstellar bomber that goes around bombing places that are unstable. the bombs are sentient and respond to people. the obligatory disaster disrupts communication between the bombs and the crew. one of the crewmen goes out and has an absurdly idiotic existential conversation with the bomb that made no sense whatsoever. the movie i saw was done in under an hour and a half, with commercials thrown in, so i suspect that dark talon is an overedited version of dark star.the alien is an inflatable red beach ball spray painted with a pair of monster hands that it walks on. it was silly and unconvincing as an alien.it's hard to believe that john carpenter had a hand in this. his other movies were so much better.

this is probably the only movie i have ever not been able to make it all the way through. not only was it annoying and boring, but the low production values made it hard to make out the action and in some cases the dialogue. avoid this one like the plague.

i really seldom give either one or ten stars to any movie, but this was so awful, i had to make an exception.i am a scifi fan and have seen a few comedic takes on scifi that i genuinely like. there just wasn't anything here to like.i realize this was started with an extremely small budget by a film student. but even considering that, the sets and effect are bad. the cinematography is mediocre, but may be the best part of the movie.the acting is bad. a sad state when the female voice-over for the computer is the best actor. the dialogue is bad. the script is very weak and the plot is incoherent and almost nonexistent.the humor is not just subtle and sublime; it's nowhere to be found. as an example, a whole 20 minutes, of the 80 minute film, is spent on a lame 2 punch combo joke with the alien mascot and the elevator.this was supposed to be a parody of everything from bad 50's scifi to 2001. what we end up with though, is just a slightly updated version of an old 50's scifi c-movie. at least those movies were funny because they took themselves seriously.

i haven't reviewed on imdb before but this documentary is so overrated that i felt compelled to vent. i wouldn't have even finished watching if i hadn't been a guest at someone's house. the film was poor on many levels: first - treadwell's video footage was contrived. the more i watched, the more he seemed to be acting as a person desperate to be famous instead of one acting out of conviction.second - the others in the film, with the exception of treadwell's parents and the airline pilot, were just as contrived and corny as he was. god, they seemed artificial.third - treadwell's mission to protect the bears doesn't even make sense as he did more harm than good by making the bears grow accustomed to human presence. i believe that treadwell really did love the bears but there is much research which indicates his efforts were misguided. sometimes we have to sacrifice our enjoyment of wildlife to really help.fourth - the film's entertainment value wasn't half that of other wildlife films such as "march of the penguins" and "winged migration". the filmmakers, in my opinion, did a poor job of sequencing scenes and gave little incentive to keep watching.as a person who loves alaska, bears, and other wildlife, i would love to see more people dedicated to the preservation of our wildlands. hopefully their efforts will be less people-centered.

i found this film extremely disturbing. treadwell is delusional and disturbed, to the point of probably suffering from a mental illness. the footage shown is him and not an actor, but yet it is showing behaviour that ended in death. is it appropriate to show actual footage of a suicide? let's not mince words. the film shows footage of behaviour that directly led to his death.for those who think that treadwell is some kind of hero, think again. the footage he shot is about him and not about the bears and foxes he claimed to be helping. he did no meaningful research into their habits or numbers and did nothing to actually protect them. all he did was run around in the bush and convince himself that he was better than everyone else. reality is, by helping to desensitize the animals to humans, he exposed them to great risk. his self indulgent behaviour not caused his own death, but also the death of his companion amy plus exposed his beloved bears and foxes to greater harm.but i'm also concerned about werner herzog's actions in compiling this film the way he did.a friend and i have had a long argument about this film who loved this film. he believes that seriously disturbed people make for interesting subjects and he cites the movie downfall as an example. but in downfall they use actors. we didn't see the real madga goebells put cyanide capsules into her own children's mouths.there was something about using the real footage in grizzly man which reminded me of that horrible football stadium tragedy where people were being crushed to death and the photographers who could have helped, elected to simply keep recording the horror.herzog's film shows us that treadwell's footage is more about treadwell. but herzog has done the same. his own personality and opinions are aired in this documentary, which is supposedly about someone else. scenes such as the one where he listens to the tape are not necessary. we already knew what was on the tape because the coroner had told us. we didn't need herzog shedding a tear with one of treadwell's former girlfriends. it didn't add to the film.the film showed us that treadwell was very self-indulgent, but it also showed us that herzog is as well.

i used to love the muppets. the muppet movie, the great muppet caper and the muppets take manhattan were good family movies, cleverly written and fun to watch. i never thought i would see the day when they would jump on the hollywood sleaze bandwagon, but here it is: scooter as a caged rave dancer, pepe making lewd and suggestive comments every five minutes -- this is not your father's muppets. it's not jim henson's muppets anymore, either.this "it's a wonderful life" themed movie has its moments, but not enough to save it. i cringed while watching this with my children. i still have hope for their next movie, but this one was certainly a disappointment.

i am still waiting for that dark muppet film where we won't know how it ends from the beginning. i think linklater could do one hes experimented with animation. this time i was intelligently not expecting such a thing but deeply wishing.joan cusack sucked. she moved to a made-for-tv level lazily acting this one with cliched cynic. the muppets were more life-life than she was. a disappointment.but then the entire film was, bar pepe. i loved him. he was the only one to ever get me laugh(while goldbergh as god got me choking and cursing). if we can't see a dark muppets than how about at least a pg:13 one with more of pepe's controversial jokes and animals metal-head, egg-nog-chuggin persona.the worst muppets i saw even the boring christmas carol beats this one out. the muppets need to avoid this over commercialized holiday.5/10

i am and have been a serious collector of christmas related movies, tv shows, holidays specials, etc., for over twenty-five years. please heed my warning and do not be mislead by sterling reviews & media hype about this movie. this is not a muppett movie as we have come to know them, and is certainly not for children. the fact that this was produced for a major tv network is/was no surprise considering their level of operation at this time. what is hard for me to believe, is that the jim henson organization stooped so low to become involved in this travesty of christmas.i wish there had been reviews for me to read that would warned me before i wasted my hard earned money on this piece of trash.

it's too slow paced and complex for children, and too lightweight and dull for adults. none of our family (6 weeks to 66 years) could be bothered watching it all the way through.are there jokes in it? i couldn't really tell. there was certainly some unnecessarily adult innuendo. there was probably a bludgeoning message of sorts, but i wasn't engaged enough to care.the live talent are just stumbling and mugging their way through it. i have to wonder if they were actually being paid, or whether it was some form of community service or plea bargain."please, keep watching," whines daniel; honestly, i wouldn't bother.

i've been a fan of jim henson and his characters since the very beginning. the most beguiling thing about them was the love and innocence and camaraderie shown. kermit was a role model of deep thinking and problem solving. a spiritual character, yet sweetly and believably so. all the other characters were slightly eccentric but it demonstrated how different kinds of beings can co-exist in a caring manner together, respecting each other's difference.following movies have somewhat kept the same vibe. yet this "it's a very merry muppet christmas movie" would have jim henson spinning in his grave. these characters have been completely re-written to be horny, nasty, selfish, and cheesy.the cast goes on to portray god as an uncaring corporate head, with a mean streak. angels as spineless, non-spiritual corporate staff, and the movie was so bad i had to stop watching. i had bought it for my great-nephew but fortunately i preview anything i give a child.this movie deserved the trash bin instead and has no socially redeeming content or charm.shame, shame on the people who re-wrote the characters and departed from jim henson's original heart-centered, socially conscious version. it does a terrible disservice to a great hearted man who is no longer around to defend his creations.

i once saw a bit of this film, and was interested to see the full thing just to see why the critics give it two stars, the result being that i agree. basically the film begins with kermit the frog (steve whitmire) telling all his muppet chums that they have lost everything, and he ends sitting depressed (and possibly thinking about suicide) on the bench. meanwhile, in another world (heaven) angel daniel (david arquette, who had already been in muppets from space) visits the 'boss' (whoopi goldberg, another reason i wanted to see the film) to show that kermit really needs help. in the flashbacks, it shows kermit, miss piggy (eric jacobson, not the original and better frank oz), gonzo (dave goelz), fozzie bear (also jacobson), pepe the prawn (bill barretta) and all the other muppets have prepared a stage show for many people to see in the christmas holiday, and it all seems to be going well. but the really mean rachel bitterman (joan cusack) is determined to either shut the show or the theatre down, and kermit is doing everything possible to make sure that doesn't happen. of course, kermit fails the last time, and bitterman tells him that they are finished, and she can officially take the theatre. this is where daniel is sent as kermit's guardian angel to try and help him, but kermit is not in the mood, and eventually ends up saying "i wish i was never born". obviously, you can recognise the spoof of it's a wonderful life, with kermit as the george bailey, and cusack as the mr. potter, and in the end, obviously kermit realises how much he means to everyone, and goes back to find the theatre saved as historical landmark. also starring whitmire as rizzo the rat and beaker; goelz as dr. bunsen honeydew and waldorf; barretta as dr. teeth, rowlf the dog and swedish chef; jacobson as animal and yoda (the only character who sounds similar to oz's version), william h. macy as glenn, matthew lillard as luc fromage, carson daly, molly shannon; scrubs' zach braff, sarah chalke, neil flynn, john c. mcginley and judy reyes, mel brooks as joe snow; brian henson as scooter and janice; jerry nelson as robin the frog, statler, pops and floyd pepper, and kevin clash as sam the eagle. the most memorable moment for me is the stage spoof of moulin rouge, besides that and the well known faces in it, not fantastic. it was nominated the emmy for outstanding music and lyrics for the song "everyone matters". the muppets were number 47 on the 100 greatest pop culture icons. adequate!

i saw this movie for the first time on nbc friday 11-29-02. it was a pretty good movie, but i don't think it would be the kind of muppet movie jim henson would make. i mean first of all, pepe' using the word "sexy" every now and then, and pepe saying "it would suck?" and i defenitly know jim henson wouldn't allow kermit yelling "i wish i'd never been born!" thirteen time a minute. this movie just isn't like a classic muppet movie. sure i can understand nicky holiday stealing the baseball diamond from "the great muppet caper," but a business lady cheating the muppets in a contract for their theater to turn it into a smoker's nightclub. if jim henson was here today, he would hate this movie!

do you know what farmers spray on fields ? that's right - manure , so when the bbc decided to make a much hyped conspiracy thriller about gmos and farming what we got was some of the smelliest manure the bbc has inflicted upon its audience !!!! spoilers !!!!fields of gold opens with a bunch of masked scientists in a lab where a female scientist ( according to the right on trendy bbc all scientists are women ) announces " a new strain of wheat that will save the third world from hunger " then the story switches to another equally bland scene . if you're going to make a thriller of any type shouldn't you open with a hook that grabs the audience ? doctor who was brilliant at this as was the x- files while 28 days later opened with a hook that took place in a laboratory. i guess someone at the bbc didn't think this thriller needed a hook because the viewers had trailers stuffed down their throat for weeks in advance as the ( not very exciting ) story continues a couple of journalists ( one's a drunken man with morals lower than bill clinton and dubya bush combined while the other is a female journalist full of virtue ) investigating patients at a county hospital who might be getting bumped off via " mercy killings " . it's at this point things start getting confused as the female journalist is threatened by mi5 spooks and the first episode ends with the main mi5 spook getting murdered the second episode reveals that the patients at the county hospital have actually been dying due to being infected with a vrsa superbug . this is when things go totally hay wire . all throughout fields of gold the audience have been led to believe the intelligence services and the company shown in the opening sequence have been behind the deaths - but they're not . it turns out the bad guy is an organic farmer who has been manufacturing the vrsa superbug in his bedroom and the story ends via the matrix camera work with the drunken male journalist setting fire to a field ridden with vrsa thereby spreading the superbug throughout the land i find it impossible to say a good word about fields of gold . at the time of its broadcast i was both a member of the scottish green party and greenpeace . i have since renounced my time in the environmental movement but even now i am somewhat offended by how environmentalists are portrayed here and to have the bad guy spreading a fatal genetically engineered virus as a warning to the dangers of genetically modified organisms is very silly. it's a bit like a cnd member letting off a nuke in london to warn of the dangers of nuclear war . i was also slightly offended as to how the male characters were written as being bastards while all the females were highly intelligent and morally superior to men . there's also other problems with the script especially with regard to vrsa . if unlike the scriptwriters you take the time and trouble to research vrsa you'll find it's entirely different from what is seen here . oh and if you set fire to diesel it doesn't explode like napalm . perhaps the worst criticism of the script is that it resembles jeepers creepers structure wise whereby the last ten minutes contradicts most of what has gone before . where as jeepers creepers only lasted about 90 minutes fields of gold lasted twice that length so is doubly irritating and illogicalas a footnote environmentalism never makes a good theme for a thriller ( anyone remember those steven segal movies ? ) and it's about time tv and film producers realized this

what was wes thinking making this dribble? it does not jive well with any of his other work but then again he seemed to fall into a slight slump after making a a nightmare on elm street. this can be seen by his follow ups 1.invatation to hell 2.chiller 3.hills have eyes ii 4.deadly friend 5.serpant and the rainbow 6.shocker all of these films were either mediocre our crap it was not until people under the stairs that he gained his momentum back and started to kick butt again. chiller it'self has none of craven's regulars and none of his suspense. the only good scene in when the old man has a heart attack on the stairs after graveling for his job.

interesting topic. pathetic delivery - script and direction. our hero, miles, thaws out and has his emergency world-first life restoration surgery. this is where the fun begins. the underlying issue is that miles has no soul!!! this is used to explain his quasi-erratic behaviour of being indirectly responsible for two deaths (i believe this to be the total number of deaths in 104 minutes). on the livlier side, miles prefers the odd glass of brandy, blazing fireplaces and his young, maturing female cousin. the finale does indeed do justice to this film.some thoughts: 1. producer $$$ were parted with to create this tripe. j.d. feigelson was the script writer and a (or sole) producer. looks like he did not learn a lesson on "how not to bring an interesting idea to life" when one views his other writing credits. this will support the credibility of this script.2. now available on dvd!!! this is truly scary. should be forever "bottom of the shelf" in vhs format.3. a re-incarnated human without a soul will default to an evil entity. 4. the score offers minimal support. not even an in-form jerry goldsmith could save it.5. deserved the 0230 time slot on tv and a touch more entertaining than the infomercials + test patterns it was competing against at the time of my viewing.6. thankfully did not spawn any sequels ala wes craven's "nightmare" franchise. chiller too: the return return of miles, or something like that.despite my rating of 1, i still recommend this movie as a great example of how to kill an acting or script-writing career. this should apply to directing, however wes craven will eternally be exempt due to his sole good piece of "a nightmare on elm street" 1984.

i purchased a dvd of this film for a dollar at the big dept store. that's probably the best and kindest comment i have to offer on it. at least it didn't cheat me out of the cost of lunch.the problem with "chiller" is craven's problem as a director. the man has his apologists who claim his traveling papers prove he's a really smart guy and all-around sharp conceptualist. but it's no secret that, as a director, he has never possessed one iota of the visual and story-telling sense of a hitchcock. as vigorously attested by "chiller", he's much closer to that legendary flat-foot hershel gordon lewis. what craven lacks as a director is the main ingredient that would lift him from director for hire to a higher plane of film- making.let's be specific. the transitional moments of this film are sleek. the establishing shots give it the feel of a quality production. the film looks professionally put together, in the way a film shot by a tv commercial director would. (a thought: the films only visual distinction, these transitions that at least look professionally handled may very well be the work of some second unit directors.) it's the parts between the bridges and smooth transitions -- the drama -- that fall flat. the core of the proceedings are invariably perfunctorily handled. the critical shots (after, say, the departing car drives into the well-positioned camera, then we cut to the night exterior of a hospital, then to the waiting area and hallway, then to the phone booth in the corner that will figure in the next bit of action) are quickly dispensed so we can hurry up and get to the next part. craven never comes anywhere close to exploding the dramatic or visual possibilities of any moment. the net result of all this misplaced attention to the least important parts, and the fumbling rush to keep things moving, is a film that feels like the work of the fledgling art student who sharpens all his pencils, fussily adjusts his easel and lighting set-up, grinds all his pigments, stretches and primes his canvas ...and then has nothing to say. craven, like the art student, never gets to the meat of the exercise.for craven apologists who will point out that this film was made for tv, i will point to spielberg's "duel" and say no more.

this movie was one of the worst i've ever seen, it did not left out a single clichee one could imagine about a hollywood-so-called-thriller. the protagonist is a loving father & a private investigator who is engaged in a special task: finding out if a suspected "snuff" movie is real.certainly, he get's involved deeper & deeper, smeary pornoshops (run by mexicans) & sex theatres are his field of investigation as he's searching for the murderers of the woman in the "snuff" movie. assisted by a "smart" (he read a book) sexshop employee, he's catching up with a murderous bondage-film producer and his personal perverts who are responsible for the film... ...and what do you expect? they are portrayed as the simple evil, no need for explanations, backgrounds, history: they are the bad ones, and he's the purifier. boom. killer of the killers. end of film. is it that bad? yes, i'm afraid so.ironically, "machine" (the mega-pervert who did the killing) is even pointing at his ridiculous character: in the last scene, our hero forces "machine" to put off his leather mask (yep, of course he's wearing one) and recognizes that "machine" looks just like the normal 08/15 guy from the street. then "machine" says: "blablabla i'm not a monster, my parents never abused me, i had a nice childhood, i just love to do what i do!"i just love to kill people. yeah, sure, "everybody loves killing people" (bender). it's not only the total lack of character what made this film so boring, it's also it's ugly "i have to kill these people"-attitude which makes you sick. in one scene, our hero has tied up one of the killers and tries to shoot him...but he can't. so what does he do? he calls the mother of the killed woman, says that her child is killed and asks her whether she loved her child so much that she wishes to see the killers dead. the mother cries yes, she'd love her child, he goes back to the tied killer and slaughters him.to come to the point: this film is breathing the foul air of lynchmob-supporters (certainly the police does not play any role in it), moralizes in a ridiculous form against pornography, does not take it's characters serious and wastes your time with a stupid plot. probably the only good thing about this film is that it does not try to pseudo-psycho-analyze ... even that would be too much plot.don't waste your time with this.

there is nothing good to say about this movie. read revolution for the hell of it or any of his other writings. abbie was often dismissed as the clown-prince of the '60's, but he was a man of ideas who used his cleverness, his sense of humor and pop culture, and his flamboyant personality to get attention to his ideas. the media too often concentrated on the man, not the ideas, and that's the problem with this movie, too. later in his life he did suffer from depression. but this flick is like a national enquirer version of abbie. he deserves better. if you don't know abbie or his times, this movie won't help. this film lies. i give it a zero. 

want a great recipe for failure? take a crappy, leftist political plot, add in some weak & completely undeveloped characters and then throw in the worst sequences a movie has ever known. let stew for a week (the amount of time probably spent making this trash).the result is 'steal this movie,' a cinematic experience that takes bad movies to dangerous and exotically low places never before conceived.this movie utterly blew chunks at my face for its entire run time. words cannot convey how painful it was to watch. this is not one of those bad movies that you and your friends can sit around and make fun of. this is not 'plan 9 from outer space.' this is a long, boring and sad waste of time. 'steal this movie' is the biggest waste of energy and talent i have ever seen. it depresses me when i realize that people *actually* took time out of their lives to act in this tripe, if you can call it "acting." but then again, when you have poor direction, poor writing, poor everything - "acting" is the last thing to criticize.this movie is like a huge, disgusting turd that you yearn to quickly flush out of existence, fearful that a friend or loved one might somehow see it. i really wish i could somehow destroy every copy of this film so it will not pollute the minds of aspiring filmmakers. thank you, robert greenwald, for giving me newfound respect for every other movie i have ever seen. you have shown me what is truly awful and why i should appreciate all those movies that are merely crappy and/or boring.

the trouble with this film, like so many other films that fail, is the script.the script is so unfocused it flounders around all over the place. what is the story here? ok, it's a biopic but i think everyone will agree there is no way that an entire life can be condensed into 100 or so minutes. some selection and editing is required but this script just didn't select or edit enough. it didn't render hoffman's life down to one or two definable pivotal moments or themes that the audience could identify with and, through them, 'get' the bigger picture of the whole man.the movie wanders from being a straight plodding 'troubled genius' biopic, to semi-docu/mocu-mentary (using new shots faked up to match archive footage), to sub true life sob stories movie of the week (the whole "i'm bringing up a son who doesn't know i'm his dad" shtick), to political conspiracy theory movie etc. etc. it just never makes its mind up what it wants to be, and the half-hearted citizen kane like narrative structure (reporter interviewing people from hoffman's past) is soon abandoned which leaves the film even more unstructured and flabby than it starts out.the movie is full of moments and incidents that contribute nothing to the story and could well have been cut to leave room to expand something more important. the whole scene in the psychiatrist's office after vincent d'onofrio pounds the window screaming "i'm abbie hoffman! i'm abbie hoffman! i'm abbie hoffman!" ("i'm acting! i'm acting! i'm acting!") could have easily been cut. all that happens is the psychiatrist says "you have bipolar disorder here's some lithium.", and the two women in his life say "we could see you weekends more often." and bang! that's it. no more mental health problems. it is such a laughably pointless tokenistic scene it could easily, and should, have been dumped before it was shot. the scene where they all get high and watch newsreel footage from viet nam and hoffman phones god? pointless. tells us nothing about anything. yet, when it comes to a pivotally important moment like the drugs bust, the film making is so hurried the situation just comes out of leftfield and doesn't make any sense to the audience. suddenly he's dealing in heroin? where did this come from? why? what is going on here? i, being a middle-aged leftie, would guess i am sitting well within the target audience for this movie but even i got fed up with the portrayal of 'the man', 'the pigs', 'the fuzz' etc. as brutal, be-suited, unthinking, hippie-hating androids. it may have been like that in 60's america, i don't know, i wasn't there, but in film terms it was cheap clumsy polemic.having said all that vincent d'onofrio was convincingly charismatic as the younger hoffman and i could watch janeane garofalo in anything, even reading a bus timetable, though she just wasn't right for this part.

let me start out by saying that i am a huge fan of abbie hoffman and have read steal this book and steal this urine test. also am a even bigger jerry rubin fan. but his movie was a discusting pile of rubbish that made a very pg version of abbie hoffman. the director took no chances into making abbie hoffman interesting in this movie. they despicted stew albert as a f***ing cartoon chjaractor devoid of intellegence, the man was a proffesor at berkley for christsakes. ok they did a horrid casting job for anita hoffman, did a horrible job casting for the jerry rubin character. i just guess the movie doesnt fit the news flashes that i have seen of abbie or the books that he wrote. the movie just didnt fit and upset me. oh yeah and theat is the absolute worst voice over i have ever heard of richard nixon. this is one of the few movies that i have ever rented that i could not sit all the way through because, i have a passion for abbie hoffman and his discruntled band of yippies and this movie was just plain badly done. and it hurt me that now when people see a movie about the yippies they will see a terrible adaptation, and not get a true sense of reality. instead they get a hollywoodized palanthra of crap.

this film plays like a demented episode of vh1's "where are they now", or "behind the music". in the first half of the movie (that depict his "glory days") abbie hoffman is unintentionally portrayed as a sort of delusional rock star. you know the kind; the poseur lead singer, the pretty boy, who didn't write any of the music, doesn't have a clue, but gets all the glory for nothing and chicks for free. consequently he takes his success for granted, abuses it, and ultimately destroys it along with himself. indeed hoffman's glory days ended abruptly when he was busted for dealing cocaine, skipped bail, and went into hiding. the second part of the movie deals with that time in hiding. in it we see hoffman as a pathetic crybaby endlessly blaming everyone, anyone, but himself for his downfall. eventually the times pass him by completely; and he can never to come to grips with that. how sad. the end. end credits roll and oh no! we learn that abbie hoffman eventually committed suicide in 1989.i'm sure this is not the image the filmmakers intended for hoffman in making this movie. given that tom hayden and gerald lefcourt were involved, i'm sure they intended this film as some kind of homage to the life of a man who was after all, an icon of the 60's and of the left's anti-war movement. in this they have failed miserably. the film presents abbie hoffman as a mindless caricature. we are never told about what drives him. how did he arrive at his views? how did he manage to capture the imagination of a whole generation? how did he organize such a vast movement? why at the height of his fame did he get involved in dealing cocaine? why? who knows, and since the filmmakers don't seem to, ultimately who cares?

this fake documentary is flawed on a lot of points, it's badly made, has uninteresting characters but the biggest problem i have with it is the basic premise.this film uses the idea that h.p. lovecraft has traveled to italy and that some of his work is based on real supernatural events that he witnessed. i'm willing to go along with the notion that he traveled to italy (only for suspension of disbelieve) but that some of his work is based on reality and that insmouth exist is total nonsense.first of all, lovecraft didn't believe in the supernatural, in his letters he clearly states that he considered himself a mechanical materialist, his monsters where there to show that humans weren't so special after all. another myth used in this film is that lovecraft was an expert on the occult, he wasn't, all his knowledge on the subject came from the most basic sources.so we end up with a film about people jelling at each other a lot and when we finally see the monster, it's so bad that you can't even laugh at it, you just feel a pain in your love for horror.after seeing the film frankenstein lovecraft said that he felt sorry for mary shelley because he felt that her work was butchered. i feel sorry for lovecraft.

so many of these types of movies out these days. this zombie flick falls into the major "cheese" category unlike the far more polished dawn of the dead, and day of the dead. in all fairness those 2 movies were major studio releases with big budgets behind them. but they were also good movies. a low budget movie can still be good if only they would stop accepting and using the worst scripts around. whoever wrote this movie must have been drunk the whole time.this movie had so so special effects and a very un-even plot line. the one major difference from other movies of its type is the time it takes for people to transform into zombies. in this one, it seems to take just seconds for them to die and then turn into a zombie. yet with the ease this "infection" spreads you can have zombie blood all over you and not even seem to be at risk for infection, and believe me the people in this one get covered in blood.the main problem i had is that our 2 main stars at times were walking around dozens of zombies and didn't get bit. when everybody else turns into zombies amazingly quickly these 2 were swarmed by zombies when they were even unarmed and were able to come out of it without a problem. our hot chick star even survived a missile strike on the building she was in. i was laughing out load at that point. unarmed, having like 10 zombies on her and a missile hits the building yet she manages to get out without a scratch? ok sure....also whoever advised these people on how special forces behaves obviously never spent any time in the military. they should have watched a movie like blackhawk down first to get at least an idea of how they behave in combat situations.one soldier was a fat overweight special forces private. lol that was a good one. another kept going up to zombies thinking they were survivors, even putting his weapon down at one point. these guys are in there to fight zombies and they were acting like the soldiers from the movie stripes. special forces, lol...then they get to the point at which they try to explain the zombie girl in the rubber room and the whole thing gets very confusing. the explanation is muddled and does not even follow the first movie. it made no sense at all.the only thing i liked was the anti bush jokes. the military lady at the beginning told them that the order came down from the vice president to the president and at the end it was the vice president from an "undisclosed location" giving the orders. that was the best part of the movie for me.

a college professor is working on creating zombies and, wouldn't you know it, things go horribly wrong. next thing you know, the whole campus is overrun. thank goodness there's a pair of uber-commandos trained for just such a situation. too bad they must be accompanied by a group of moron-commandos, lead by a rapper (he doesn't even bother trying to play a military guy, he just responds to his superiors as if he were rappin' wit' da homies in da hood). the high point of this part of the movie is the locker room scene. the male and female moron-commandos share the same locker room, and apparently military regulations require all females to wear black bras and panties. hey, if you can't make a good movie, at least you can have women in their underwear. my hat's off to the film makers.so, after much discussion of how well prepared these moron-commandos are for the job (bosnia, afghanistan, iraq), they all get killed off in fairly short order. their biggest downfall seems to be that it never occurs to them to turn any lights on. a typical encounter has them walking into a room and seeing someone at the far end. human or zombie? can't tell. flip on the lights? no, moron-commando protocol requires them to walk up to the person, making sure to hold their gun in such a way that it can be easily knocked out of their hand, and well, you know the drill. the demise of sergeant major sticky fingaz is especially fun - my favorite scene involving a rapper in any movie i've ever seen. luckily (and again, hats off to the filmmakers), the hottest babe among the moron-commandos manages to survive. her and the female uber-commando both wind up in tight t-shirts for the remainder of the movie. now this is how a military operation should be performed! there's a bunch of running around, punctuated my humorous stuff like the uber-commandos being unable to get through a simple ventilator grating (it obviously is a thin piece of aluminum that you could easily put your fist through). this necessitates a plan to rub zombie guts all over themselves, and even though we've seen nothing in the movie to indicate that zombies locate their prey by smell, they're good enough to immediately begin sniffing the zombie guts and let our heroes go.a few other funny bits - the paris hilton gag, the "can you hear me now?" gag, and the fact that although the zombies immediately bite secondary characters, main characters are able to fight their way through dozens of them without being nibbled on. another chuckle is provided by mr. fingaz, who can't seem to pronounce the word 'tourniquet' (toe-no-kit?).overall, it's somewhat amusing. could have used some more interesting characters, but for a sci-fi channel original, i was mildly impressed.

ok i have to admit that i quite enjoyed house of the dead despite its well documented failings. this however was the worst film i have seen since demons at the door. compared to datd the effects are vastly superior. however the plot is weak, the acting reminiscent of everyone's favourite, the porn film, and the decisions and actions of the "characters" consistently verge on the moronic. i feel like trying out uwe boll's latest cinematic outings just to get some sense of perspective over hotd2. i am not suggesting that he is really the cure, more a case of a different disease, but when your senses have been insulted in such an abhorrent manner the only way is up. ok there it is. i have managed the ten line minimum and shall waste no more of our time on the waste of celluloid that is house of the dead 2.

ok this movie was by far worse then the first one and the first one sucked! the zombie make up was extremely fake! the acting is very poor! and it doesn't really follow the first one! while watching this i kept thinking wow the first one is a masterpiece compared to this. i would say catch it on tv, don't spend your money on it! its not the worst movie i've ever seen but its on the list. i started watching it last night and fell asleep so i watched it today and almost fell asleep again! the plot was pointless, i mean i get the fact that a small military group are sent on a mission to get the blood of the lead zombie and bring it back so they can use it to save lives and stop zombies but they made it where you wanted everyone to die. they made plenty of bad guys who really were just annoying. if you ask me this was a rip off of resident evil and not a good rip off either. the plot could have made it if the acting was good and if they actually made you feel scared to see whats behind the corner. with these zombies my grandma could have went in that building and survived! out of a 1-10 i give it a 2.

oh man, where to even begin.....dropping your gun to get in hand to hand combat w/ a zombie, while holding a bitten soldier down debating to shoot him b4 he turns, then he turns and bites the person holding him down, turning your back on a "fallen" zombie, continuously shooting the chest and seeing it doesn't work, so they shoot the chest some more, having the idea that a kid slumped at a desk w/ blood coming out of his mouth is still alright, walking along a football field like nothing is wrong then all the sudden noticing the zombie football team doing whatever in the middle of the field like they couldn't have been seen up to that point....i could go one for a few more hours, but you get the point.....childish writing and dialog, bad directing, horrid special effects, truly sad and undeveloped storyline (zombie infested campus, must get the viral host then lose it....twice), the only plus i can find is that this one doesn't include clips of the actual game during the "action scenes"....id say don't waste your money, but id be more upset about the waste of time, i saw it on cable and wanted the 2 hours of my life back

i will keep it to bullet points so here goes: 1. very badly scripted. 2. tries to be like resident evil. 3. zombies slow and docile one minute the next minute raging lunatics. 4. never saw blood clean up so easily! 5. special effects not as good as the original "day of the living dead". 6. acting not as good as the "bold and the beautiful". 7. it looks like it was written in 1 week and made the next week.basicaly med team plus special forces go into a zombie infested university to find the first zombie and extract a serum to cure the plague. all die except the 2 main stars so predictable even though unarmed and swarmed with 100s of zombies they survived. however special forces (who were trained at kindergarten school scouts) only took 1 zombie to kill them even though they had weapons. also the obligatory jerk on hand to fill any gaps. overall load of rubbish.

isn't it strange how crap-movies always tend to be a little better when you start watching them with an attitude like: "boy, this is going to suck harder than few things have ever sucked before"? it's pretty much impossible for anyone to rent this movie with high  or even remotely positive - expectations, as "house of the dead 2" is a sequel to something that is generally considered to be one of the absolute worst genre disasters ever to be released. the abysmal reputation of the original actually turned out to be a great advantage for director michael hurst, as it was really easy to surpass the quality level of its predecessor. and exactly how embarrassing must this be for uwe boll, huh? having to acknowledge that a straight-to-video sequel without star power or promotional campaigns is much better than his own pretentious video game interpretation? in case anyone still doubts: no, "house of the dead 2: dead aim" isn't a good horror movie at all but, yes: it's definitely better than the first and even worth renting in case you're looking for an undemanding splatter film with loads of gory butchering, sleaze and stupid humor. there's no real connection with the events in the first film (another advantage) and this part two opens like a typically rancid sex comedy set in a college campus. the male fraternity club plans to attack a sorority house, inhabited exclusively by blond coeds with enormous breasts, but the party gets interrupted when an insane professor (sid haig!) who runs his car over a girl and takes her back to his lab to turn her into a zombie. this is the beginning of a quickly spreading and deadly epidemic but, no worries, as the government is prepared and sends their best scientists & soldiers to the campus to search for survivors and to bring back blood samples for an antidote. hunting down zombies seems like the most common thing in the world for this squadron, they even named them hyper sapiens, but their constantly increasing amount eventually endangers the lives of the most hardened soldiers. director hurst thankfully found his inspiration in the more eminent classics of the genre, like james cameron's "aliens" and  of course - george a. romero's dead-trilogy, particularly "day of the dead". he luckily also didn't made the same mistakes as uwe boll, who inserted footage of the actual video game in his movie (why?!?) and *slightly* exaggerated with the use of cgi-techniques. hotd 2 contains heavy images of violence, like chopped up female corpses and detailed amputations, but it never really becomes nauseating or shocking. naturally, there's isn't the slightest bit of suspense to enjoy and every dreadful horror cliché features here as well. the film is very enjoyable as long as story writer mark altman doesn't try to explain the origins of the zombie epidemics. they're walking corpses with their brains hanging out of their skulls, so we really don't need to know what caused their deaths. especially not when the explanations are given by a blond sorority slut who clearly hasn't got a clue what all the medical terms mean. just avoid getting bitten, sweetheart.

i am furious! it has been a while since the last zombie movie i've watched so i was really looking forward to watching a good ol' gory zombie movie. hotd2 was a major disappointment. a reasonable story but awful acting, filming, dialogue, and nauseating clichés and punch lines. i didn't even see the first one which is supposedly worse than this one...now i am curious about how bad could that one have been! the film is full of mistakes and goofs. who on earth analyses dna using a blood sample!? why are these "special forces" who "have been to hell and back" fight like spoiled 6 year old girls? we see ferocious zombies who would take a bite at any chance they get then hundreds of them that wave their arms at our two "heroes", take them down to the ground, then let them go without even a scratch. i could go on and on about this but life is too short and i have already wasted a couple of hours watching this pathetic movie which is an insult to the movie industry.

when one of the stars of a movie is named sticky fingaz, you should know enough to stay away. stay away. house 2 is just more of the same, this time with zombies overrunning a college campus (man, how that must have saved on money). as usual, the "zombies" are given no direction so speak of, and provided very little makeup or costuming. they look like the zombies in one of those endless italian zombie cheapies from years ago. which is to say, they don't look like the kind of zombies we know and love from george romero and dan o'bannon zombie flicks. the folks battling the zombies are all nonactors who get to shoot guns and do little else. some who have written here feel the sequel is slightly more focused than the original. all i have to say is i'm glad the sequel's director did away with the 360-degree pan shots that helped to ruin the first movie. house 2 is still just more of the same, which means a lot of nothing happens for 80 or 90 minutes. there is one set piece, involving soldiers tussling with a zombie football team, that might at least have been funny. it's not.

i used to work in a video store. i saw this title in the horror section and took it home as a free rental one night.this movie was truly awful, there is no redeeming quality about it, because it actually takes a well respected sub genre of film and just goes about destroying it. if the first film wasn't low budget enough then this film truly takes the biscuit, being housed (mostly) indoors and at night...therefore avoiding the scenic cost setting of the first film in the first 5 minutes of this film a college lecturer comically runs over an attractive student. rather than be mortified, the lecturer half heartedly apologises and the girl mentions that despite being thrown across the cars bonnet (he sped up as he approached her) that there is nothing to worry about...after which he attacks her with a crowbar and kills her! if this isn't strange enough, he wants to perform an experiment upon her, bringing her back from the dead....and so feels the need to remove her clothing to do so.soft core female nudity (and pubic hair) is rampant throughout the film and is, to be honest,the only real thing to hold the average male viewers interest...like the swimming scene in the first film...but even having said that this film goes from bad to worse with its bad character acting, crappy dialogue and absurd plot turns....why introduce a pivotal character who has survived 29 days from zombie attack only to kill them within 10 minutes....its just a very very bad film

if you haven't seen the first one you have to at least know someone who has and you have to know it was painful to sit through. there just wasn't anything good to say about it at all. so what's different with the second one? why bother making a sequel for a movie that was wretched? this one doesn't take itself too seriously. it knows it was made for tv and doesn't try to impress with great or serious dialogue. there are moments where it tries to get 'serious' or 'intense' but these moments are so corny you have to laugh.thankfully gone are any elements of uwe boll and any hint that this originated from a video game (other than the title of course). don't go into this movie expecting anything worth mentioning to your friends unless they're into camp, lame zombie movies, or are interested in making a drinking game out of this movie. take two shots whenever ed quinn's character mentions his dead brother! take one shot whenever a bullet would have been better place in the head of a zombie instead of pumping three in the chest! etc etc.

so lame it isn't even funny. a zombie infection overtakes a small college campus and a government squad of secret operatives back up a couple of scientists sent to find the origin of the outbreak. collecting zombie dna damn sure is not easy. once bitten you're one of "them". the entire university has been completely infected by the run amok undead.this sequel does not even redeem the awful original house of the dead(2003). senseless entertainment is accomplished though. a few glimpses of female nakedness added to a gaggle of gore and exploding heads should keep any zombie freak happy. credited cast members: emmanuelle vaugier, victoria pratt, ed quinn, sid haig and nadine velazquez. the "f" word holds together an unimaginative script.

terrible, boring zombie sequel is only marginally better than uwe's horrible first film. it consists of a group of soldiers going into a zombie plagued college campus to find a certain type of blood which could assist in finding a cure for the infection. these soldiers are your typical lambs to the slaughter and none of them are that drawn out(or at least aren't very interesting)so you don't feel a sadness at the pit of your stomach when they are disposed of. the film has the typical zombies biting humans and blood splatter. it even has the same munching on guts. it just doesn't do anything for the zombie genre to give it memory. and, the story's climax is rather anti-climactic and ridiculous. one wonders how two people can submerged in an army of zombies and not get bit(for they are the main stars who seem to always manage escapability)while others seem to get bit rather easily. the film sole motivation is to show people getting bit..nothing else. just go watch a romero film for lasting effect.

i can't get over how lazy the director is with this movie. instead of setting up scenes in a creative way he relies on boring old zombie clichés.where the two unarmed leads have to get down the college steps into the van he surrounds them with zombies yet neither of the leads is bitten. he can't be bothered to direct a decent fight scene so we see the leads shove their way down the steps.sometimes the zombies limp about and at others they run like the wind. this is really convenient for the director because he can set up anything he likes without bothering with continuity in the behaviour of the zombies.with careful planning and a lot more inspiration this movie could have been so much better.

how bad can you make a film. a good question which house of the dead 2 succeeds in answering. i could not believe it was possible to get something worse than the first house of the dead but amazingly the director has succeeded. the only feeling you get from the film is that its bad, just bad. what with overacting, bad fx and a stupid story. its this kind of movie which gives a bad name to z-movies in general. why could they not learn the lesson from the first house of the dead movie? anyway i guess you will have understood by now that you should not see this film. it is but a waste of time. watch "bad taste" or "dawn of the dead" if you want to see some good zombies.

"house of the dead 2: dead aim" (2005) is the sequel, though you really don't need to see the first "house of the dead" to get this film. that said, the production value is definitely here, with great zombie effects and it's edited quite nicely, with very effective sound design. however, that said, that's about all that's good here.the story and script are awful . . . there's blatant plot holes everywhere. it's also funny how the soldiers don't mind if they get blood on their faces (unlike in 28 days later where blood in any part of the body will infect you). also realistic how there's little order with the soldiers here unlike the usual us military discipline.a 4 out of 10.

this is one of the most awful movies i've had the misfortune of picking up. don't get me wrong, i love a good zombie flick, but this wasn't one of them....might as well (from the opening scenes, at least) been called 'titty zombies from outer space'. it had absolutely nothing to do with the other movie or the video game (as far as i could tell.) the best aspect of the film is how the two main characters can get covered with so much blood and remain so nonplussed. i would certainly suggest giving this one and miss and staying with a safer zombie pleaser like '28 days later' or 'dawn of the living dead' (the remake, of course, unless you're into some serious campy action.)

i'm sorry, but they did leave the impression that these commandos fought zombies before. but they sure didn't act like they even seen a zombie before. jumping and turning their backs on them like amateurs. second, the characters are pretty badly written. the actors did the best they could with what was given, i blame bad writing and bad directing. lastly and here is where the spoiler warnings are highest. they loose the sample twice and the girl jennifer holland doesn't know if she's been bit or not. how stupid is that? as much as it hurts to be bitten, one would think you would know, plus gallons of blood leaking from your body is a good clue. dumb, the first movie had it's flaws but it has re-watchablity, unlike this disaster of a movie, which i could barely get through once. i give the house of the dead 2: no guts, all stupidity the crap-o-lantern

when uwe boll, cinema con man extraordinaire, released the first house of the dead adaptation to completely deserved mockery, it was generally agreed among fans of the source video game that one would have to be incredibly moronic to contemplate making a sequel. hollywood's per-capita ratio of morons must indeed be high, for not only do we have a sequel, it was distributed in the antipodes by sony, a company not normally known for its taste in expensive write-offs. released direct to television in america, the sequel does improve on the original in most respects, but in so doing, it becomes bland rather than interesting. the scale of the scenario is enlarged, with the action taking place in a deserted town that just happens to surround a university where experiments in a virus that can reanimate the dead have been occurring. in particular, the action is spread throughout the university, where the first infected denizens can be found. put simply, the film differs from the original in that it actually occurs within a house where dead people can be found.the cast, on the other hand, is a real step backward. emmanuelle vaugier was specifically made up to resemble a low-rent angelina jolie, while the rest of the cast never reaches the level of a slumming-it jürgen prochnow. in fact, the only name that will stand out among this cast is one sticky fingaz, who probably did not want to be recognised that easily by the people he faces at home. put simply, these people could not convincingly order pizza on the big screen, even under the best direction. say what you will about boll, but he at least inspired actors like ona grauer to fight against his ineptitude. that said, the people involved here at least seem to be aware that their film sucks and that they might as well have some fun with it. much of the problem with the original was that the director thought he was crafting some kind of misunderstood masterpiece, and he took himself seriously. unfortunately, with the actors failing to take their characters or the predicament seriously, what little dramatic tension there could have been is undermined.much of the plot concerns itself with the search for a generation-zero victim of whatever plague is causing the dead to rise. or to translate into more practical terms, they are trying to find someone who was infected just after the virus mutated into a form that was threatening to humans. how this would help when a non-mutated strain is usually required to create a vaccine is anyone's guess, but the manner in which this quest is paced out suffers problems of its own. the we-have-to-go-back plot device is used in order to pad out the running time, but the actual timing of the extra quest is also problematic. we are told at one point that the town will be obliterated by cruise missiles in ten minutes, yet the heroes drive back into the university, locate the sample they are looking for, and fight off enough zombies to eat the army of china, all in this space of time. filmmakers take note: it only pays to be specific with time when it can serve rather than hinder dramatic tension.the special effects used in house of the dead 2 leave those of the original in the dust. where uwe boll simulated the deaths of the characters using idiotic rotating camera tricks, michael hurst instead uses all the graphic details his budget can allow. necks are bitten, arms are cut off, heads are shot. it all makes for a much more convincing throughput, but it also disallows the mockery of obvious fakery. the photography is also much improved. as dvd crypt put it, the fact that it is in focus throughout makes it an improvement upon the original, but this also deprives us of something to have a laugh at the expense of. the writing is also both an improvement and a setback. throughout the script, references to other horror and survival horror games, the most obvious being run like hell, are offered. the first couple of times, they work because they offer clever ways to work titles into ordinary, everyday dialogue. after the eighth time, however, they just get on the nerves because they remind gamers of things they would prefer to do with their time.interestingly, house of the dead 2 cost a mere six million to bring to television screens across america. given that tom savini on his own would cost more than this to work on a film nowadays, i have to say i am somewhat impressed with the visual results. in contrast to the much-reviled original, the zombies here look like actual zombies rather than extras in bad makeup shot poorly. in a further contrast to the original, the actors appear to have a clue what they are doing. sealing the deal is the fact that apart from some real zingers scattered throughout, the characters speak like real people. however, the story is nothing that we have not seen a thousand times already. when aliens, the real dawn of the dead, or the evil dead were released to acclaim, the acclaim came from the fact that these films either did something we had not seen before, or did it so well that we did not really care. house of the dead 2 is competent enough that we do not mock it, but it brings nothing new or particularly brilliant to the table, so we end up not caring either.for that reason, and many others, i gave house of the dead 2 a two out of ten. it is too good to be bad, but too bad to be any good. unless you are into sucky films as much as i am, you are best to steer clear of it.

i saw the first house of the dead and expected a root canal to be more pleasant to attend, so when it wasn't as bad as that, i was delightfully surprised.unfortunately, i then got my hopes up that the second one might be okay as well...and i was wrong.apparently i'm one of the few people who saw this movie that thinks it was bad.i don't know whether to watch it again and force myself to see whatever all the people who gave it good reviews saw, or wonder if i saw the wrong movie.ed quinn as ellis and emmanuelle vaugier as alexandra 'nightingale' morgan did a great job in roles that were way beneath them. they deserve to be in better movies.the special effects were okay and some of the characters likable/hate-able and that made for a tolerable watch, but for the most part, this movie was just a waste of time.oh and i have to ask this because i found myself asking it aloud all the way through the movie...did anyone not know how to close doors behind themselves so zombies wouldn't just wander into the rooms? only once did it happen, (zombies wandering in) and i found that a little convenient...soldiers walk into a room, leave the door wide open, pay little to no attention to same said door so the zombies can just walk in if they feel like it (with the hapless "livings" being cornered with no way to escape) and yet only once did zombies follow them in.nitpicky? maybe but honestly...if i was fighting for my life, the last thing i'd do would be to walk into a room and leave the door wide open so zombies could swarm in and eat me.that is really the only thing *bothered* me throughout the movie, and just the movie for the most part was a bad sequel to a not totally abominable original.

i was on a mission to watch uwe boll movies to see if they were really as bad as all that. the first one i saw, bloodrayne, was not a complete loss. i liked it more than most people, and actually rated it a 4 out of 10. next up was the first house of the dead movie. now that was horrifically bad. i could stand watching ten minutes of it, and fast-forwarding a bit, and that was it. i could see where it was going and i didn't need to see any more of it in order to rate it a just 1 out of 10.but i had access to the sequel, too (which however is not by uwe boll, but, mysteriously, written by the same guys who so incompetently wrote the first one), and since it got a higher rating at imdb than the original, i thought i'd give it a chance. and i actually managed to watch all of it. it started out with some funny references and cool lines (like how the president got his orders from the vice-president!), and acting-wise it is light-years better than the first. here we have cool muchachas like the ultra-hot emmanuelle vaugier, whose coolness is in league with carrie-anne moss, claudia black and evangeline lilly. man, i hope some matrix-style movie comes along for her sometime. and the always delectable, super-aerobicized victoria pratt. i love athletic women. and, there was also nadine velazquez (catalina on "my name is earl"), who performed quite well.the story wasn't much, and the action wasn't great, either, and the ending was a disappointment, as they didn't succeed in their mission. oh well, at least the two mains survived. guess that's some small victory, too.good cast, but a pretty bad movie. the actors make it watchable, but there's no real substance there.3 out of 10.

granted, hotd 2 is better than the uwe boll crapfest that was the first one, but thats like saying drowning is better than being chopped alive. ok ok, i'm being a little bit harsh with this one, its just that video game adaptations of zombie movies always leave a bad taste in my mouth. resident evil was alright, but its sequels are pure rubbish. the first hotd was entertaining crap more than anything else; uwe boll saw to that. and hotd 2 was...better? the entertainment value was there, the hot chicks were there, the gore was there, but... this is it? the script, even though subpar, was better than the first one. but in the script dwells horribly written characters, stupid action sequences, clichés, and an ending that drags on and on reaching a level of ridiculousness which would make the bollmeister very, very proud. but, it could've been worse right?hotd 2 stars sig haig (yes, sid haig) as an insane doctor looking for a cure to death. as you may guess, it all goes to sh*t. a nearby college campus seems to be the center for the zombie (or hypersapien?) epidemic, and as you may expect, a group of commandos and two zombie scientists try to save the world by going there and neutralizing the problem. their main goal? no, it ain't blowing sh*t up. instead, they have to get a sample of zombie blood, so they can create a cure to the deadly virus. between this and that lays bland character interactions, an insufferable amount of clichés (but hey, at least the black guy isn't the first one to get killed), and decent looking zombies. the acting is passable. who would've thought that sticky fingaz was a passable actor? not me. emmanuelle vaugier and ed quinn shine somewhat as the leads. and the supporting cast was passable too. it was all passable. the make up effects on the zombies were alright, it could've been worse like in the first hotd: just guys running around in dusty mummy suits. the gore was alright too. cheap scares and even cheaper tension are almost non-existent in this movie, which is a good thing. the action sequences were stupid as f*ck, but at least there wasn't any sword fighting zombies or that ridiculous slow motion bullet effect. overall, this movie will appeal only to zombie enthusiasts, fans of the arcade games and for someone who wants to rent a cheap horror movie for the weekend. apparently there's going to be a third one as hinted by the ending, but i wouldn't count on it. unless uwe decides to do it. a 4.

olivier assayas' film stars asia argento as a woman who had a relationship with michael madsen. madsen is a business man who's in financial trouble. in desperation he is going to sell his share of a business to a company called golden eagle, a company from the far east. as madsen begins his moves away from his company asia argento returns to his life. the pair had a torrid love affair that included her doing business favors for madsen (with said golden eagle). once argento enters the film the film follows her as we see the tangled web she's woven and how the complications spin dangerously and violently out of control.i'm not a fan. actually i was quite bored as the film seems to go from pillar to post for much of the first hour during which i kept wondering what the point was other than to provide a meaty role for argento. argento, daughter of director dario argento and a director in her own right, is a unique actress. at times stunningly good, she is more often then not going to give you a quirky off beat portrayal of a damaged human being. sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. i don't think it completely works here mostly because the script is too "complicated" to support it. i didn't care what was going on so her wounded girl just rubbed me the wrong way(she seemed more nut job than anything else). i'm not blaming the actors but writer/director assayas who has once again constructed a complicated tale with the sort of parts actors love to tackle, but which leave audiences scratching their heads because they they don't really work. if you must try it on cable

asia argento has never done a film (so far as i know, and this includes ones directed by her own father, dario) where she fails to show all of her anatomy at some point. sure enough, in the most boring opening dialogue scene ever, poor madsen has her coming into his office and right there, reminding us that even though her hair is up, she can still stick her fingers in her crotch at any given second (which she does but in such a random "what? am i really seeing that?" kind of way). the dvd box, packaging, makes this look like a femme fatale film so you keep waiting to see her turn into a sleek and minimalist killer.. no such luck. she's verbose, hung up on some aging has been and even worse, has no credible skills in physical agility other than (surprise!) taking off all the clothes when any scene allows it. her accented english would be cool if only she didn't try to make it sound so affected and try to talk like a 12 year old. how about this plot? weak-minded but simultaneously nymphomaniacal woman is suddenly driven to kill while she already has another affair on the go and is running some cheap drug deal ... huh? what? does anyone have motivation in this movie to do anything other than buy a hamster? the screenplay seems to be oriented by letting everyone talk a lot about the same things over and over (i was expecting to see the worst acting on this appear as a producer who dumped money in it just to have some screen time) - there is nothing going on sub the obvious flaws of asia's character that at any point in the movie delivers what the dvd cover promises. she's weak... but she knows how to kill. she flails a lot. she flails naked, she flails half dressed, she even flails in a dead woman's clothing.. she is very floppy and unmotivated. in fact "floppy" would have been a great name for this movie.. and a shot of asia passed out looking angry on the cover would have been a better representation ... there are actually shots of her eating airplane food!!! what's that about? the ending makes 0 sense - everyone is just annoyingly wishy washy in their intent and their execution of all objectives. the wife of lester doesn't deliver any real vengeance (taking someone to bad karoeke is life threatening but not really valid).. and lester just floats around without really making much proclaimation of anything. totally misleading key art... yeah, we know asia lost the baby fat of her first born but really, a whole movie trying to pretend like that's interesting enough to drive a film about a passive-aggressive chick is not worth your while. see point of no return instead.

you have to start worrying when you see that michael madsen is leading the cast of any movie. i wont go through the list of shame that is his movie career.i watched 45 minutes and still was not sure what really was going on. the movie consisted of a love hate relationship between madsen and argento, which basically was madsen insulting her, threatening violence and generally treating her like dirt. she on the other hand loves him, then shes doesn't, then she does, the she desires him, then she loves him again......whats wrong with you woman !!!! the script is awful, lousy soundtrack and pointless aggressive and crude sexuality which i believe was added to entice some viewers as the movie has little else to offer. i would have given the movie a 1 but it just about managed a 2 with a little excitement in the last 20 minutes. it did actually answer one question in the final few minutes but i am not going to share that, i will make you suffer for the full movie like i did.

if you're an average guy like me and enjoy good acting, good plot, good scripts, novel ideas, or being entertained, you might want to skip this one. i was honestly bored from the opening credits to the very end, but tried to give the film a chance, and watched it all the way through -- only to be disappointed at every turn.the acting was unbelievably sub par, but i'm not sure if the actors themselves are to blame or if it was the ridiculously wooden and horrible dialog coupled with an even worse script. the plot is very vague and underdeveloped and i think the audience is supposed to derive some kind of deeper meaning from it, or be able to look past it in some way, but honestly to do so would be a waste of time.the film has a kind of crude sexuality to it which doesn't serve any purpose other than to show off some tattoos and lingerie. no one seems to have any motivation except making money off of some kind of "investment" deal that is never really explained. the connections between the characters aren't terribly clear, and there is little to no character development.this is either some kind of sub-culture film meant for a very specific audience to enjoy or absolute crap, but you can decide for yourselves.i gave it a 2 because it is definitely one of the worst films i've ever seen, but probably not the worst.

a quick resumé: almost nonexistent, badly chosen musical soundtrack, steady-cam filming done without the steady but with lots of coffee and a hyperactive cameraman, no plot, and nothing ever really happens. the film goes from one dialog into another, sounding hollow, never achieving depth, never creating the illusion that you really are inside a cobweb of conspiracy, and the everybody-has-an-affair-with-everybody is just a boring excuse to show the main actress in nice underwear. (which, combined with her rusty voice certainly is nice, but nothing to base a movie on) the high point for me is the opening scene, and the film just degraded from there to a point where i just wanted to quit the film about 45 minutes into the story. i regret sitting it out.

well another shootem up. typical run around film with guns, revenge, and violence. not much of a story. in fact i forgot most of what this film is about. don't rent this one. i think the exercise infomertial would be more entertaining during late night.

the movie is not that bad, ringo lam sucks. i hate when van damme has love in his movies, van damme is good only when he doesn't have love in his movies.

the story: alain, a french policeman, is shocked to discover that he had a twin brother when his body is found in nice. investigating the murder, he finds out that he was in possession of a list that details the deeds of the russian mafia. helped by his brother's girlfriend, alain dodges russian gangsters & corrupt fbi agents while trying to find the list."maximum risk" is another one of the long list of action films that feature jean-claude van damme. as far as things go, it is strictly formulaic. the script sticks to the clichés & the acting is mediocre. there are some nicely done action sequences, with an inventive car chase, a fight in a burning building, an escape through rooftops, a brutal fight in an elevator & jcvd fleeing his enemies over an elevated train line. director ringo lam keeps everything going at a reasonable pace.

i don't think it's necessary to outline the plot for you, because the site and other users have done a superb job of that already. that said, here's my take. this is by far the worst movie of 2005, and there have been some really, really bad ones. i don't even need to go into detail because there is nothing redeeming about this movie. bad acting, bad plot, bad directing, bad special effects-you name it. if it doesn't stand alone as the worst film ever made, it's tied with some other piece of crap. i'd be embarrassed to have my friends know i was in this movie. but hey, most people that are gonna see it will do so no matter what reviews it gets, so more power to ya. when you feel the gaping void between your neurons two hours into your evening, don't blame me.

los angeles, 1976. indie film brat john carpenter, fresh out of film school and with one film - his class project's no-budget spoof of 2001 called dark star - under his belt, finishes a gritty actioner called assault on precinct 13. the story of an almost deserted police station under siege by an unseen la gang, it was a minor hit on the drive-in circuit and garnered small praise from the few critics who cared, but it hardly set the film world on fire, unlike carpenter's follow-up smash halloween (1978). on precinct, carpenter was still learning how to exploit his almost non-existent budget by using lower-shelf actors, keeping the action to the one hellishly small location, and moving the film along at a tight pace with a combination of editing, intelligent camera work and switched-on genre savvy.no-one wants or needs to be hungry in hollywood anymore, particularly if the week's catering bill on the 2005 version of assault on precinct 13 is more than the entire cost of the original. it does translate into a certain kind of laziness on a filmmaker's part - you have a stupidly large union crew, a studio and a marketing firm all doing your thinking for you. which is why twenty years after watching carpenter's film i can still see every glorious moment, from the small girl gunned down in cold blood while buying an ice cream, to the relentless pounding synth score. a week after assault 2005, i remember larry fishburne's unmoving ping pong ball eyes and little else."forgettable popcorn actioner" fits the top of the poster perfectly. it's new years eve at precinct 13, a station closing down with a skeleton staff to see in its final hours. on call is jake roenick (ethan hawke), an ex-narc now deeply troubled and hopped up on jack daniels and seconol after his partners were iced in the opening scene; iris (the sopranos' drea de matteo), a nympho with a thing for criminal types, and jasper (brian dennehy), a crusty old timer one scotch away from retirement. as in carpenter's assault..., a bus with four heavy-duty criminals is rerouted to the precinct. all boozy eyes are on gangster kingpin bishop (fishburne, still beefed-up from his time in the matrix) who has narrowly survived an assassination attempt from an undercover cop and plans to blow the lid on the endemic corruption in the organized crime unit led by marcus duvall (a tired-looking gabriel byrne). soon the phones are out, the power lines are down, and both crims and police find themselves heavily armed with a serious police arsenal and consumed with paranoia while waging war against a task force of duvall's corrupt cops sporting white balaclavas, bullet vests, infra-red bazookas and more high-tech gear than the skywalker ranch. this, we're expected to believe as the helicopters buzz around the top of the police station shooting rockets into windows, is a clandestine operation to cover duvall's tracks. he may as well have taken out billboards on hollywood boulevard.as with the recent seventies genre reworking dawn of the dead, assault 2005 takes the barest plot essentials of john carpenter's original and, to quote the seventies, "does it's own thing, man". the main question is - why bother? john carpenter's 1976 is a cult favorite among genre buffs, but is hardly branded in the public's collective consciousness. carpenter himself was busy reworking howard hawks' classic western rio bravo into a tight, claustrophobic urban thriller for only $20,000. french wunderkind director and rap producer jean-francois richet, a self-professed fan of john carpenter's work, seems less concerned with making an homage to either hawks or jc - although the script is peppered with references to cowboys and injuns - and seems intent on squeezing in as much flash and firepower as the multi-million dollar budget can withstand. the result: some tense moments with hand-held pov cameras, an unexpectedly high (and bloody) body count, a few neat plot twists, but essentially a b-grade urban actioner with a much inflated price tag. as for name-checking carpenter, it's pure conceit on the part of the filmmakers that doesn't pay off.to monsieur richet, i say bon voyage, and i wish you luck on your music career.

it's new year's eve, a cop-killer (in the form of, laurence fishburne) end up at a precinct that's closing down due till snow. when the people are layed siege on, cops have to team up with cons to survive. this re-make of the john carpenter classic just had to add a few beyond stupid plot twists, take out all the tension, and add a horrid john lequizamo to the cast, didn't it? the first film was thrilling, gritty, and a joy to watch. this one is more hollywood, clichéd, and painful to behold. the only thing i took from this movie was ocd can be very annoying...very. the ending song is sooooooooooooooooo bad.my grade: d- dvd extras: commentary by richet, demonaco and jeffrey silver; delet scenes with optional commentary; 5 minute "armed and dangerous" featurette on the weapons expert; 7 and a half minute "behind precinct walls"; "plan of attack"; "the assault team"; 12 and a half minute behind the scenes featurette;, trailers for "unleashed", "white noise", :seed of chucky" miscelanious: i got this at best buy and it came with a bonus disc including the first 2 minutes of "cry wolf"; a 10 minute first look at "unleashed"; the trailer for that film; and a fuzion interview with john leguizamo

i'm sure a lot of guys will love this movie. the only woman who shows any "balls" (unfortunate pun regretted) is made to look, talk, and seem like a guy, the other 2 women are portrayed either as sexual objects with one thing on their mind- sex / being sexy, with sex as their only attribute and skill (iris) - or as freaked out pretty little princesses who's neurosis negates any strength and professional authority they had before all hell broke lose (doc). the only strength iris has in the end is the result of some advice from a big strong man. besides my negative gut reaction as a feminist, i have to give the camera work props- and ethan hawke is great in the very first scene. after that his performance loses steam. empty entertainment for a brain that wants to take it easy. at least the film skims the subject of the duality of good/bad in the criminal mind.

assault on precinct 13: 3/10: let us forget for a moment that assault on precinct 13 is a remake of a classic action movie. taken completely on its own merits assault is a debacle. lets start with the rio bravo style scenario. about a dozen people are trapped in a decaying police station in detroit (if the detroit location is giving you robocop warm and fuzzies stop right now. it could have easily said topeka in the opening credits and nothing would have changed. in fact the last bit in the forest would have made more sense.) surrounding them are our bad guys; corrupt cops.now i know what your thinking. corrupt cops? were the nazis and drug cartels busy that weekend? of course these are no ordinary cops. these guys are right of the cover of the latest tom clancy video game. yup we have body armor; helicopters; laser sights; night vision goggles the works. so we have thirty s.w.a.t. members/special forces armed to the teeth verses 4 cops (drunk mind you it's new years eve), 2 girls in party dresses and half a dozen criminals. so how do our heroes defend themselves? truth is they can't. they all should be dead within ten minutes tops. (not to mention the characters inside have an annoying habit of walking past the windows.) now an illogical scenario is no reason to completely pan a movie esp. a b style action film. however with the exception of laurence fishburne and ethan hawke all the other characters seemed to be comic relief. (at least i hope they were) while ja-rules and leguizamo's characters are bad enough. it's aisha hind's minstrel show that takes the cake. rarely has a more stereotypical african american character appeared on the modern screen. her performance resembles a frat boy in blackface and drag acting ghetto. in the original assault a gang member takes over an ice-cream truck and drives around the neighborhood shooting little girls in the head. i have had an irrational fear of ice-cream trucks ever since. after this assault i have a perfectly rational fear of remakes.

why remake the original "assault"? to my mind "assault" was carpenter's true masterpiece. it had all the elements good carpenter movies contain. external threat on a small group of individuals. people taking the challenge because they are forced to do so. isolation! just remember, the guns in carpenter's original made no sound, being thus a lot more threatening than conventional devices. and now this remake. concentrating on "main character i"s psychology and on his relation to main character ii (the evil but honorable). the anonymous threat in the carpenter movie replaced by a rather conventional conspiracy/corruption background. the "remakers" just didn't understand the main plot of the original. and thus produced something pretty ordinary.

i found this movie at a xxx store for $1 on vhs. the interesting thing about it is that camp video bought up the rights to it and slapped on a 1986 copywrite date in the credits. anyways, enough of odd facts.this film is absolutely not scary. to even call this horror or a "thriller" is laughable. there were only maybe 5 minutes at most of what you would call horror in this 80+ minute film, and that consisted of the acting, because it was horrorible! all puns aside, the writing for this film was absolute garbage as well, just as the special effects and makeup was laughable. no wonder this is such an obscure film, probably the director has spent the last 35 years scouring the country for all existing copies of it and burning them in one big pile so no one else could be subjected to it.

have you ever watched a film, when after it's conclusion, your left pondering what in the world it was all about? well, say hello to "scream, baby, scream". it's not that the story's complex or anything like that, it's just that it plays out in three completely different modes...1. a fun 60s drug movie...2. a much overplayed soap opera...and 3. a horror flick (with very little to "scream" about). much to my surprise, i've found out that it was written by one of my all-time favorites, larry cohen. well, i guess even the best have to learn through trial and error.playing out much like something from h.g. lewis(only with lesser fx), this "bad" film does have it's perks. for most of it's short running time there's a pretty cool jazz score to be heard, and there are a couple of memorable scenes...one of those being where a group of kids decide to experiment with acid and take a nice long motor bike ride to the zoo. the camera tricks the director uses to indicate their hallucinatory state is just plain retarded, but amusing. trust me when i tell you, there's no need to run out of the house to catch this one!

...or is this another way below the bottom-of-the-barrel masterpiece? preferably both! somewhere between 1969 and 1972 came a host of several horrible horror movies that are all but lost again. nothing more needs to be explained, asked, or screamed out loud. if you followed closely at my writings about carnival of blood or guru the mad monk, then you know what's in store with scream baby scream. the title sounds cool; it's just the weak script that should have gone someplace else! even so, this is hands down, the most dreadfully written piece of cinematic mastery ever worked on film!if you thought this is an early slasher (which benefits the average imdb user to write up another comment), better luck next time! the real truth behind the script has nothing to do with the movie, which supposedly tells of a blue-faced psychopath out to "kill" and make some ugly facial sculptures on his victims. it feels like you're watching another early "scooby-doo" episode. my favorite scene is the monkey cage where the four young hippie teenagers play in. and hooray for an actress under the name "eugenie wingate" for giving us the worst facial makeover, ever! 1969 has never been this bad, but it is!try finding this 30-year old rarity at a bargain basement for five bucks; it makes the perfect novelty item for going back to those psychedelic days of flower power, bad fashions, and trashy music! interesting note: scream baby scream is also listed in troma's film archives on the company's website. only time will tell when this reaches the top of the bottom 100 list along with a few more early 70s cheapies; gosh knows they need to!!! plan 9 is history!!!

maybe you have to be a former hippie to fully appreciate this, because aside from some dated fashions, music and dialogue, it doesn't really have a thing going for it nowadays.four fun-loving college art students enjoy carefree days of painting nude models and riding on motorcycles. they take acid in one scene and go to a zoo. a sign flashes on the screen that says "do not feed the animals," and suddenly they're in a cage laughing and hanging from a chain tire swing (?!) an evil artist (larry swanson) tells (in flashback) how his art career was almost ruined because of a crippling hand disease. he sends out zombie henchmen dressed in black to kidnap people, then injects them with a serum that distorts their faces. he's trying to create some new form of abstract act (i'm guessing here, the details given are a bit fuzzy, to put it mildly). meanwhile, jason (ross harris) sets out to save the day after his friend scotty (chris martell) is killed and his girlfriend janet (eugenie wingate) is kidnapped. i thought the zombie make-up in zombie lake was awful, but wait until you see it here! it's by douglas hobart, the star of death curse of tartu. a small role is played by brad grinter, the director of the z-classic blood freak, which is much, much more enjoyable than this deadly dull turkey (aka nightmare house).useless trivia note: the 1984 regal video release features the wrong cast (for the brides wore blood) printed directly on the video label!score: 1 out of 10

what about scream baby scream is supposed to make me not feel like a fool for buying it? i bought it because, god help me, i'm a sucker for old b-cinema even as worthless as this. nonetheless, something about this movie irritates me, it's probably janet, janet comes off cold & snooty, seemingly, with the intention of coming off as deep and noble, with a look on her face that screams constipation, she can't seem to agree to anything her uptight boyfriend wants. i'm glad that this is her only role. what really irritates me is that this is a 1960's gore film gone terribly awry, and as we all know, awry is floridian for "zero gore". it's like the director started with a herschell lewis style but backed out of the gore scenes when his wife found out, so instead we end up with one dull conversation after the other, and basically, a whole lot of irritating nothing. in other words, we end up with florida bore. joseph adler should be embarrassed. janets boyfriend, jason is almost as ridiculous as she is, this guy has something negative to say about absolutely everything, come to think of it, he's probably the least likable good guy in horror history. the only thing this movie really has going for it is that it carries that 60's/early 70's b-gore vibe that you can find in stuff like undertaker & his pals, blood freak, or most anything from herschell lewis. even rodney from the gruesome twosome is in this, i ithought his caveman comedy routine was irritating, most everything from reel to reel is stupid, even the trip scene was stupid. the only positive thing at all is the small amount of beach scenery, but that mostly includes janet whining about life not being perfect. in the only real ironic twist, scream baby scream gets even less interesting once the story finally gets started, around the 45 minute mark. if you happen to be indifferent to whether or not your entertainment is watchable, but are offended by the color red, you might not hate this. why does troma distribute this? wouldn't this be something weird video's area? scream baby scream very well may be the worst in florida horror/gore of its era, but, i suppose, underneath the unlikeable characters, and the incoherent plot, lies potential. scream, baby, scream really just seems like it should follow the blood feast pattern, so, to steal a quote from janet, "if it doesn't fit, i throw it out". 2/10

pathetic nri crap.....appeal to all who are not indian's....this is the worst of indian cinema,made by the worst piece of nri trash.....the story is boring and clichéd (the way nris and westerners view india).....go for it if u want to be bored to death.the movie deals with the plight of widows in india before independence.a lot of it is true even now in remote rural areas but not to the extent as depicted (maybe because its a period movie).....there are plenty of other indian movies directed by extremely talented directors that are worth savoring...this one is a definite miss...watch a documentary instead or look up information on the net if you are genuinely interested in the plight of the downtrodden in india.i wasted my time.

deepa mehta, arundhati roy and a host of other so called intellectuals get the title of intellectuals because of the fact that they love portraying india and hinduism in a bad light...and deepa mehta makes her money from it anyway. anyway hindus are too gentle or scared to protest the way muslims protest so anybody can take any liberties with hinduism. and it is a fact that during the 1930's women in the west were also illtreated when they were widowed...just that nobody likes to point out anything bad about the west or anything other than india and hindus. she paints an inncorrect portrayal of india and the situation of widows there. nowhere is it mentioned that child marriage is illegal. she ended the movie saying there are 34 million widows in india. of course among a billion people, there will be that many widows. but how many are living life she has depicted in the movie?? deepa mehta finally is selling india and poverty to make dollars. how pathetic....

copy cats have copied this movie from a 1974 hindi movie called "call girl"! "call girl" had an identical story line. the way in which the protagonists fall in love, then rebel and the climax all same in both these films! "call girl" is better than water, at least from the story telling point of view. it was not as agonizingly slow as water! water on the contrary does not progresses at all. the aim is perhaps to make the audience sympathize with kalyani for ever! are indian film makers any better than just being great copiers these days? well they call it "being inspired". in their language it is: "getting inspired (without any citation that is!)"! :)

deepa has again tried to bravely bring out a subject that no one wants to talk about. the story line is ok, cinematography is outstanding, screenplay and acting are way below average. i guess the blame is to the citizens of uttar pradesh in india from where her original set was destroyed in 2000. this resulted in a totally different cast, i just wonder what a spectacular movie it would have been if it had the original shabana azmi, nandita das and aamir khan. the current actors lisa ray (who's just good for squirming in bombay dyeing bedsheets) and john abraham are pathetic, need basic lessons in acting. seema biswas, raghubir yadav and kulbushan kharbabda have saved the movie as much as they can. the kid had done an outstanding job. the editing and the flow of the movie is also not something you would have expected from deepa. great subject, sends out a strong message about a practice which is still pretty rampant in rural india but falls short of the standards deepa set for herself in fire and earth. watch it once...when its on dvd, don't bother paying $10 to see it....well its out beats the average hindi movie any day

i am a big fan of deepa mehta's work, especially fire and earth 1947. unfortunately, this movie of hers lacks _all_ that is needed for a good film.the movie attempts to showcase the plight of the widows in india in the early 20th century and the new wave of ideas of their rehabilitation around the same time. shown with a child widow as a central character, although the plot too banal from an indian standpoint, it could still have been a very powerful movie. alas! the movie lacked both the sensitivity of fire and the intensity of emotion in earth 1947.even if one assumes that the story is a given, although there are hundreds of things i would have liked different in that as well, the movie making is especially unfortunate. everything is said. everything is shown straight. absence of sensitive implied sentences. absence of things left unsaid. i just couldn't believe that this was a deepa mehta film.there were some very standard hindi movie characters - like an old widow with her own vested interests, or a father who has double standards of the highest quality. can one not write a script without having these old-style standard indian movie characters?many people acclaimed deepa for making a movie and proving a point against hindu fundamentalists. well, i agree that she took a bold step, but should one not worry about the quality of movie, or is it being a controversial one an end in itself? its obvious, that if you start with a story as in water, you will end up feeling the pain of the widows in consideration --- it doesn't take an accomplished director to achieve that. and the movie had nothing more than that!! so where is deepa's contribution to the film?and talk about acting etc. - pathetic!!! lisa ray has a pretty face, an extremely pretty face - but thats where it ends. she can't speak hindi; she can't emote. john abraham is no better. most widows seem unnatural. the saving grace are seema biswas and the young girl. they are fabulous.and this was a period film - but the hindi dialogues suck big time. even there utterance is also as unnatural as it gets. no rustic accents!!! no local slangs. no nothing. the only thing right was probably the shooting locales. i thought that the set of the vidhwa-ashram was reasonably real. the overall blue tinge in the whole movie is also apt.but all and all, don't watch this movie. you _won't_ get anything. there is nothing in the story, or direction. if you have to watch it watch it for the little girl's acting.

water shows the plight of indian widows in the late 1930s, says in the end that the problem still exists largely by giving statistics in the end, refers to gandhi several times in the movie before finally having a scene depicting him and does nothing extra ordinarily innovative or new in the movie. yes, the cinematography is pretty impressive but that cannot be the soul of any movie for me. india has had several problems like many other nations but it has got rid of many of these problems at large. what if a movie is made on racism in america in a particular year which ends with 'x number of americans still experience racism today'. a) how would it be relevant, and, b) how would it be some thing so extra ordinary being depicted in cinema.a view i read from a deepa mehta interview was that this movie is being interpreted as a voice for the marginalised every where. from reviews i read every where, the common thing i am hearing is how the director did a great job and was brave in bringing a problem to the world. the movie is more about a specific problem a society faced (and has got rid of through reforms at large). i do not see any thing earth shattering about the movie. moreover, the movie lacked soul and shifted between the plots of chuiyya and kalyani. sarala, the young sri lankan actress, portrayed the role of chuiyya superbly and that was the only thing which impressed me about the movie, sadly.

if there's one thing i want to distinguish myself from all the other great reviewers here, it's that i am the queen of finding strange movies in thrift and dollar stores. that said, you can't possibly imagine how happy i was when i found this one. i can even remember that saturday morning when *every* station simulcast it, so you were stuck if you wanted to watch something else (then again, i guess that was the idea). as a kid, i didn't know if i liked the way all the different characters were stuck together (there are some crossovers that just do *not* work). but i guess the special had it's intended effect. don't do drugs because you will have nightmares about the muppets.now, if you watch this as an adult, on the other hand, you will be treated to the *strangest* anti-drug movie this side of "reefer madness". i think i'll just leave it at that before i get into trouble.

this film spends a lot of time preaching against marijuana. however, the plot and visuals are so insane that it seems more like the poster-child for lsd.plot: the heroic struggle of michael as he battles his drug addiction while being subjected to the humiliation brought on by the likes of winnie the pooh and papa smurf.yea, yea, there's a good message, but it's obscured by the fact that the writers have taken a rather stale psa idea and tried stretching it into 30 minutes. this includes a song sequence, where you're told that there's a million, rational ways to say "no!" such as "i can't smoke pot, i have homework!"the writers can't make up their minds what to do with the characters they've brought in royalty-free. at first we see they all have to hide from the human characters, but within five minutes we see them all running around in plain sight without anyone noticing. soon they begin interacting with the human cast, and the only one who's even slightly disturbed by this fact is not the drug-abusers, it's the little sister who talks to her teddy bear (pooh, by the way.) further, there's the little drug demon floating around. because you know, pushers don't give kids drugs. he too is ambiguous - while he might be symbolic of michael's addiction and hence is not supposed to be seen by other people, he laters goes and haunts little corey to get her into drugs. so i guess he's...uhhh.....moving on!the whole plot finally culminates in some insane sequence in which michael is in what would appear to be the saturday morning carnival of souls, aka a theme park from hell where the various cartoon characters beat him up and ignore him and stuff. for example, miss piggy eats him in a sandwich and spits him out. if the writers were not high when writing this, i must recommend they try getting high because they can't get crazier than this. of course, the film ignores the fact that michael's been having highs for two years by this point, so why this tripping sequence would frighten him is beyond me.i realize i'm completely whaling on this film, but i actually just saw it again because i went through the trouble of tracking it down on ebay because of it's sheer infamy of being a bad cartoon. the level of unintentional humor is is brilliant. take this scene for example - michael's dad is rooting through the fridge for a beer. he notices many of them missing and mentions it to his wife. the ever-observant mom tells him "don't worry, you probably just drank them last night watching football." while we're obviously supposed to be learning that michael is drinking beer (in addition to the pot and crack), we instead read further in and realize - hey kids, it's okay to have chemical dependencies as long as you're a grown-up! scenes like this are worth the tiny price tag of this film. oh yea, and the fact you get to hear simon the chipmunk say "marijuana."

spoiler warning!!!this is probably my least favourite cary grant film. i spent most of the time thinking: ignore him, leave him etc. is he trying to kill her? should we assume that after the end, when he persuades her to return home with him, that he will kill her after all? i see from checking in a couple of books that this is a reading that some viewers/critics have taken. finishing early is after all a more reasonable way to film a book, than to change the ending - and this is a more unreasonable change of ending than, for example, in altman's the long goodbye. unlike hitchcock's earlier example of making the murderer not the murderer because a star has been cast (when gosford park refers to the lodger, ivor novello's murderous habits are not mentioned) the book's ending is not definitely ruled out.in robin wood's hitchcock's films revisited, he writes: "as one mentally 'swiches' from ending to ending , the significance of every scene changes, the apparent solidity of the narrative dissolves, the illusion of the fiction's 'reality' disintegrates, the film becomes a 'modernist' text in which the process of narrative is foregrounded." i enjoy playing intellectual interpretation games as much as anyone else, but unless the film stands on a straightforward reading, then it fails. this one fails. even after considering the fatal glasses of milk that recur in a few hitchcock films.an annoying quibble. the year is 1941. nothing in the film says that it is set in the past. beaky (nigel bruce) keeps his money in a paris bank, and goes there to do financial business? does he not know that there is a war on? indeed, were there still any flights from croydon airport? is he on good terms with the nazis? how come it is never suggested that the germans shot him as a spy or something.a curiosity. when johnnie and lina have dinner with isobel, the mystery writer, and her brother, the pathologist, there is a fifth person present, who is never explained nor introduced - a woman in a tuxedo. the credits say that she is nondas metcalf playing phyllis swinghurst. is this not an example of how lesbians were coded in '40s films? are we to take her as isobel's lover? the books that discuss overt and hidden gays/lesbians in hitchcock (e.g. robin wood again) do not include phyllis swinghurst.

i don't dislike cary grant but i've found his performances annoying in enough films to notice; this, arsenic & old lace and bringing up baby. i don't dislike him in north by northwest but i really find that movie unbearably silly. on top of that i find the endless raving about grant's class tiresome. i don't have a clue what his class does for the viewers who herald it. it doesn't do a thing for me.in the behind-the-scenes feature included with this dvd patrcia hitchcock says that grant was her fathers favorite leading man; i think he was wrong. jimmy stewart was a better leading man in a string of better hitchcock movies.with it's ruined ending this is really half a movie and doesn't bear discussion, and can't support the high ratings it's getting. even if the movie had it's ending intact there's not much to it. fontaine is a completely unsympathetic sucker. she has to remain numb, inactive, and unwilling to contact anyone but johnny for the whole movie, in either ending, for his ploys to work. that's not much to work with. cary grant begins every line with "monkeyface..." until i wanted to strangle him. he says it about sixty times. it's positively grating. hitch's technique here is shockingly shallow. an endless succession of rooms/sets have a phony skylight projected on the rear wall as a spiderweb effect. and a light-bulb in a glass of milk may make fans excited, but it can't save a movie this poorly made.peter bogdanovich should retire if he does one more hitchcock/cary grant imitation on a dvd. i think that's his whole career now. as soon as i saw him, i thought, oh crap, here comes an imitation that only he's impressed with. instead there were two! oh joy!

joan fontaine is swept off her feet by the suave cary grant. after their marriage, she realizes that her husband is very irresponsible and owes a major gambling debt. it appears that grant tries to scheme his best friend, nigel bruce, out of part of his life savings. bruce ends up murdered and fontaine suspects that her husband will try to kill her for the insurance money. this drama drags on to an abrupt and flat finale.

there is no doubt that alfred hitchcock was a seriously talented director. many of his films are undeniable classics that have stood the test of time and are highly watchable to this day. this list could include the 39 steps, rear window, north by northwest, dial m for murder, vertigo, the birds, shadow of a doubt, and a few other films.however, "suspicion" is not aging well at all and is really so unwatchable that it seems to me that it was probably a bad film even by 1941 standards. the list of scenes that work well could be listed on a matchbook with a crayon. the script is loose and ridiculous most of the time, but the acting seems so forced and wooden and borderline amateurish throughout, that it is almost unbelievable. joan fontaine tries to shore things up but she is on a slippery slope and cary grant doesn't provide much assistance. his acting is so bad at times that i have seen better performances in high school plays or college theatre experience classes where a chemical engineer is acting for the first time with no formal training.after about 30 minutes of watching this film you may find yourself reaching for the dvd sleeve in the dark to see if you accidentally picked up some kind of special edition version that was cobbled together without any editing.the subject matter is serious, yet the film has a silly and trite feel to it that just seems so out of place you become numb with perplexity."suspicion" is basically unwatchable and another very very very overrated bad movie.

this is unique in films of hitchcock's that i've seen, in that i didn't really enjoy it.in fact, i actually found this quite predictable and annoying.cary grant and joan fontaine are a newly married couple. he's the kind of "lovable rogue" character that you've seen in many films, without ever being lovable as far as i am concerned!in fact, it was a barely believable relationship at best, and at times seemed particularly false and implausible.unable to hold down a job and trying to live an opulent lifestyle, grant is led to borrow money that he cannot pay back.fontaine is convinced that he is trying to kill her in order to get the money she is insured for; and presumably what her late father was worth.average and rather uninteresting all round actually, but as usual you can see the influence on films that have come at a later date.

lina mclaidlaw is a bright, solitary young women who falls unexpectedly in love with johnnie aysgarth, a highly eligible bachelor with a penchant for losing money. they get married, but almost at once lina is subjected to johnnie's addiction to lying, gambling and getting into debt. despite his flaws, she is unable to resist his charming manner, until she starts to suspect he may be harbouring murderous thoughts toward her ...this is a good movie, well-made, with an attractive cast, a good script and possibly the single lousiest ending in movie history. okay, that's maybe going too far, but not by much. lots of films change the ending of a book (great expectations, the shining, etc) but the last two scenes of this one not only manage to be horribly lame, but also render the entire preceding plot completely meaningless. the story is about a woman whose husband is driven by his greed and moral lacking - and what she knows about him - to kill her. it should end (as it does in francis iles / anthony berkeley's book before the fact) with him attempting to murder her. the reason it doesn't is that the studio forced hitch to reshoot the ending, one of the first examples of the godawful process of preview audience testing. hitch was canny and did what he was told (this was only his third film in hollywood) knowing that if he played the game, sooner or later he would gain creative control of his films, evinced by his masterpieces of the fifties. but that still leaves us with a turkey of an ending. this is a great shame because it really is a very good movie with an intriguing theme - does anyone really know their husband or wife that well ? the script is excellent, with many off-guard moments (such as when lina's father dies and johnnie assumes she's crying about it), a finely-judged performance by grant (who never played a villain again) and fine photography throughout, culminating in the famous glass-of-milk shot. fontaine won an oscar for this performance, although personally i prefer her confusion and vulnerability in her earlier victimised wife role in rebecca. i would like to rate this movie higher, but i really can't forgive that ending; this is what happens when movies are made for money, not love, which i guess is curiously the theme of the film itself. look fast for hitchcock's cameo as a man posting a letter.

lance henriksen got paid something to appear in this. i hope it was a lot.former us national champion gymnast, kristie phillips starts as charlie case, a gymnast-turn-secret-agent (because it's very common that munchkin gymnasts become government spies...)there's a truly hysterical opening scene where charlie's uneven bars routine is sabotaged by an eastern-bloc competitor. what follows is one of the most ridiculous stunt scenes i've ever witnessed....and they want you to take it seriously! don't worry...she sticks her dismount.everything after that is just a messy, dreck of a spy movie. watch the first fifteen minutes for the campy-gymnastics stuff, then run for cover.

i have neither read the book on which the movie is based, nor the letters between vita and violet. if i came to this movie with any expectations whatsoever, it was maybe that the bloomsbury group (including among others virginia woolf, and which the nicolsons were part of) would be depicted. it wasn't, which however wasn't a problem for me. what i am wondering about is how the people behind this movie managed to make it, in my opinion, so very uninteresting and repetitive and most of the characters flat, in spite of great material and some very good actors. the script is simply not good enough. i agree with the criticism of my finnish neighbor - too many pointless sex scenes (but only between the women, while there is nothing explicit whatsoever concerning harold's numerous love affairs), too many pointless scenes in general, too little information about the background of characters. it seems odd considering the quality of the production - on the surface it seems a really ambitious piece of work, but the script holds of course the most weight and that is where this movie fails.vita's relationship with harold struck me as unconvincing, although both of them act really well, especially her. the way they kept declaring their unconditional love for each other in a rather sappy manner i thought, well, simply unconvincing. it makes a lot more sense that it should have happened through letters, as tmmvds points out i would also have liked to know where the nicknames came from - the russian ones* as well as mar - why ever is someone called vita given the nickname mar? it might be small stuff, but it matters in contributing to the bigger picture.*i watched the movie with english subtitles on, and where it should apparently have said mitya, it said instead medea. that might explain my frustration with the nicknames to some extent - i could not understand why vita's should be greek while violet's was russian!

first i have to say that i have read everything about this subject and i know it inside out, and i was excited about finally seeing it, too. but you have to read only the book this mini-series is based on to realize that it's not the true story of what really happened almost 90 years ago. it's loosely based on the facts, the rest is taken from the scriptwriter's imagination. and unfortunately these changes are anything but successful and mostly totally unnecessary.where do i begin? vita and violet didn't use the names mitya and lushka until their affair started, and during it violet also called vita dmitri and julian. it was violet who chased vita with a dagger when they were teenagers. the 'seduction' scene when their affair started violet was much more passive than represented here and certainly didn't kiss vita first. i could go on and on, these examples were all included when the series was only just started. besides all these alterations from the facts, the characterizations are also all wrong. at times vita behaves like a mad woman. especially the scene where she saw from the newspaper violet's engagement announcement is just ridiculous. vita kept her surges of emotion inside. it was violet who was temperamental and let her feelings (good or bad) show. all vita did when she read it was that she nearly fainted, that's all. being a gentle nature, harold avoided confrontations in real life, but here he is sometimes pretty stern and accusing. harold and vita always discussed their intimate things in letters, not verbally. and violet... i know that this series purposely concentrated on vita and harold, but that doesn't mean that all the other characters have to be mere puppets on the sidelines. here she is totally one-dimensional character, and the lines gave to her are mostly embarrassingly shallow. actually she was intelligent, gifted, quite an extraordinary woman who has rarely given the credit she deserves. i have always thought her much more interesting person than vita. in this series her unhappiness, loneliness and her problems with her mother are totally ignored. viewer has also little clue of her background and family, what kind of relation (and marriage) with denys trefusis she had or how hard she battled over vita. vita was the only love of her life, her raison d'etre, and if harold suffered during affair, so did violet. after it her life was in ruins, and it took time that she could pull herself back together again. statue could have acted the role of denys, that much depth his character has. lady sackville-west is just a badly drawn caricature; an annoying chatterbox with exaggerating french accent. the series ends to the totally badly written scene in amiens, and that was the end of this affair, according to scriptwriter. no, it continued a whole year after that, and it's ending was much more lingering and sad than what was presented here. but what one cares about the stupid ending if the whole series has been stupid from the start. i have to give some credit to actors, they tried to make best of those roles given to them though janet mcteer as vita is the only one who really shines through. one can't complain the settings either. all complaints go to director and most of all, scriptwriter. instead of insightful character studies, there are too many sex scenes and bland conversation. many of the scenes are too long, some are pointless and don't bring anything to the story line. on the other hand many details are shortened or omitted altogether. especially there should have been more information about vita's and violet's youth, and how their friendship developed. this is one fascinating story which would have deserved a much better adaptation. maybe someday someone will do it. at the moment one can make much more of this story by reading the actual book or violet's letters to vita, which are brilliant stuff.

kristy swanson plays an elite hitwoman who is supposed to have knocked off a tv reporter for a group of bad guys,but once she sees this poor fellow at home playing with his kids she decides to junk the whole project and the tv reporter's life is spared.the hitwoman's life is up for grabs as the people who wanted this reporter killed now want her dead for not following through with her assignment.such is the basis for a movie called supreme sanction.supreme waste of time is more like it.we see swanson's character beat up,pummel and kill men far bigger than her.and she always one two fifty steps ahead of the group of murders who can't,for some reason,do away with this super hitwoman.having one woman do away and beat all these men,makes the movie seem so gay.it is too predictable once you figure swanson's character is going to win out anyway,thus making the film boring and inept.kristy swanson is decent actress,who in her younger days was always sexy and easy on the eyes.supreme sanction is not one of her better efforts however.

when kristy swanson gets an attack of the guilts about what she does, she wants out. unfortunately, madsen is her immediate superior in a company where "giving two weeks notice ain't an option."as a teen killing vampires, kristy did a very good job. the valley girl image seemed to fit. but as an assassin on the run...well, keep running kristy. run, run far away! this film is not a concept that hasn't been done before, but it has been done better!i didn't want to watch the rest of this film, but i felt i should if i wanted to give a review of this movie. i've always liked madsen, and his character was a bit predictable, but this movie was definitely a waste of time both to watch and make...no wonder it never got released theatrically!

a box with a button provides a couple with the opportunity to be financially free, but the cost is the life of someone they've never met. this is a very tedious film to watch. richard kelly, who wrote and directed it, decided to make a film without any payoff. you are taken on a ride of slow build ups, one after the other with minor revelations at best. at certain moments, i thought to myself, this will have major significance at the end, but nothing does. the film just leaves one thinking, "this story could have been told in 30 minutes, without all the stretched out nonsense." i will hope you avoid this god-awful film and maintain your sanity by doing so.

circus could have been so much better if they had reduced the number of twists and developed each better the film features a very gifted cast that mostly perform well , however it totally loses the audience basically everyone is back stabbing everyone else and not back stabbing them at the same time because they are backstabbing someone else and working with .... did i lose you? well the film is even more confusing clearly written by a first timer writer , it has some redeeming qualities though in the acting especially famke janssen shines as lily but sadly gets a lot of useless screen time just standing there doing nothing.....the dialogue is a bit cheesy and the accents sometimes irritating but its still worth watching if you're a fan of any of the actors especially john and famke who get the most screen time just remember to watch it with a notebook so you can write down who is double crossing who every second....

i was fascinated to read the range of opinions on `circus' from `awesome, breathtaking, brilliant' and most things between right down to `golden turkey candidate'. i find myself in the latter camp.the producers obviously thought that if they mixed plenty of over-the-top violence with barrages of four-letter expletives they'd have another `lock, stock and two smoking barrels' on their hands. a pity that they forgot to include wit, style, charm and flair. and it was certainly a mistake to feature a visit to welles' classic `the lady from shanghai' thus serving to remind us how much better cinema can be.john hannah gets his shirt off at every opportunity, a huge american drives around in a mini minor as `circus' pathetically strains for cult status and even the beautiful amanda donohoe can't add any class to these proceedings.if you want to see a good brit film try the sublime `wonderland'

would somebody please explain why anybody would want to make a "british neo-noir" crime film with a cast almost entirely american? the accents spoken in this film are bloody awful! but entirely in keeping with the performances, which are so wooden, one fears to strike a match for setting the cast on fire.really, what kind of disgusting, moronic, cynical crud is this? even neo-noir films have some character you either feel for or want to feel for, even if they're wretched and doomed; they at least have some decency to them, some sense that what they've done is wrong, or that a seemingly good plan has gone wrong, and that somehow they're stuck with the responsibility for it.not in this stanky stew. these characters are putrid, betraying each other, themselves, and the audience.also, note that they are low-lives - all right, nothing wrong with that - except that they seem to be living a life of luxury. for a film supposedly about desperate petty thieves, the keynote here is - ennui. it's all so terribly dull and dross, doncha know. so let's just rip some people off or maybe murder them, and go get laid in a luxury hotel. what ambition! gooping this whole mess to some bottom of swampy muck are: boringly uneven pacing; predictable 'action' sequences that aren't; banal and incoherent set-design; made-for-bad-tv camera-work and editing; forgettable score; and an entire lack of any imagination or innovation in production and direction.wholly unbelievable, unlikeable, and for less dedicated movie watchers(or masochists) like myself, utterly unwatchable.there are other nasty things i would like to say about this nasty film, but they wouldn't print them here. suffice it to say, you can probably find something more useful to do with your time than watch this film - just about anything, in fact.

set in 1976 for no apparent reason other than to keep the set dressers busy, 'the box' was directed by richard kelly ('donnie darko'), and stars cameron diaz and james marsden as norma and arthur lewis, a young couple who are supposedly struggling financially even though they both have successful careers--she as a high school teacher, he as an optical specialist at nasa's langley, virginia, research center. they have one child, walter (sam oz stone).one day the lewises find a parcel on their doorstep, containing a black box with a big red button. there is a note from a 'mr. steward' indicating that he will return at 5:00 pm to explain about the box.the mysterious arlington steward, played by frank langella, shows up at the appointed time, nattily attired in an elegant savile row suit. he is polite but businesslike, however his most noticeable feature is his face, half of which appears to have been blown off and improperly attended to. langella is the only thing worth watching in the movie, however he is unfortunately upstaged by his own makeup, which resembles that of harvey 'two face' dent (aaron eckhart) from christopher nolan's 'the dark knight.' it's like the elephant in the room: one can try to ignore it, but it's more than a little distracting.steward explains that he will return in 24 hours to collect the button. if, during that time, they decide to unlock and push the button, he will give them $1 million cash. the only catch--and it's a big one--is that somewhere a stranger will die. it might be across town, it might be on another continent, however steward assures them the victim will be someone unknown to them. as a show of good faith, he leaves them with a crisp $100 bill, theirs to keep whether they push the button or not.arthur and norma are skeptical, believing the whole thing to be a scam or an elaborate hoax, however it isn't long before they begin to wonder what would happen if they did push the button? would they really get a million dollars? would somebody really die? weary of the speculation, norma slaps the button. nothing happens. however, their initial relief gives way to alarm when steward shows up the next day with a briefcase full of cash. they decide to call the whole thing off, however steward tells them it's too late. "you've already pushed the button," he explains. as steward's limo pulls away, arthur notes the license number, which he later discovers is registered to the nsa (national security agency).at this point the film begins to veer deeply into unfollowable territory as the secondary characters start springing nosebleeds and flashing peace signs. meanwhile, the town becomes invaded by pudgy, slack-jawed geeks in bad shirts who start following arthur around like an advance scouting party for a race of zombie alien nerds. arthur eventually becomes trapped by the menacing bookworms in the library (?), where steward's spinsterish wife shows up--whom we haven't seen till now--and informs arthur that in order to get out of the library he must step into one of three vertical columns of cheesy-looking digital water effects. 'what happens if i choose the wrong one?', arthur asks, seeming far less baffled than he ought to be under the circumstances, and certainly far less baffled than the audience is by this time. 'eternal damnation,' the spinster says ominously.arthur steps into the middle column of digital liquid effects, and after a brief absence suddenly appears, still in his water cocoon, hovering over norma's bed. when she wakes up and sees him, the water bubble bursts and arthur tumbles onto the bed in a shower of water which, oddly enough, continues to drip from the overhead water pipes just out of camera range while a sodden marsden and diaz flop around on the bed.it's confusing, i know.we eventually learn that steward was once the public relations officer for the nsa, until he was struck by a lightning bolt that destroyed part of his face. he was pronounced dead, but later came back to life, having been transformed into a sort of superman who now serves 'the ones who make the lightning,' and whose powers have enabled him to take over the cia, the nsa, and nasa all by himself.and what is the point of all this nattering rubbish? apparently, steward's mission is to subject humans to a kind of biblical character test (e.g., the 'binding of isaac'), to determine whether humanity is worth saving. if enough people pass the button test by refusing to push it, steward's god-like overlords will spare the race. unfortunately, those people who do push the button, such as norma and arthur, must be punished for their moral spinelessness, to which end they are subjected to a series of dreary 'lady or the tiger' ordeals that play out like one of those 'saw movies,' except without the entertaining gore or the benefit of a coherent plot.'the box' represents the sort of pointless mental masturbation that freshman philosophy students like to blather on about after a few beers. richard kelly's tedious exercise in existentialist pettifoggery eventually collapses under the weight of its own incomprehensibility; the tortured melange of insupportable ideas eventually congeals, as with the mixing together of too many colors, into a meandering gray goo of a film as insipid as one of those narcotizing in-flight movies the plot of which suffers no more or less from having been interrupted by a leisurely nap.there is a point in 'the box' where arthur, who is a technically-minded guy, becomes curious about how the button works. opening up the unit, he is disappointed to find nothing inside.having seen the box, i know exactly how he feels.

years ago "ma2412" the feature film tried to be some kind of "regional blockbuster" in austria. one thing's for sure: i hope no one outside will ever have to see this one. perhaps if you are familiar with the original sitcom it could be interesting to watch what director sicheritz made of his series. i think he missed his chance and wasted time and money.so far many director's and writers have failed to make a series concept compatible to a 90min movie (consider alf, inspector gadget...). you can see how hard this is by watching "ma 2412". the result of this attempt in my opinion tastes like a never-ending tv-episode (and not a good one). it fails to deliver a plot, the humor tries too hard and the directing seems very unfocused - as holds true for the visual style.so summing up i'd clearly not recommend this one...

to anyone who likes the tv series: forget the movie. the jokes are bad and some topics are much too sensitive to laugh about it.we have seen much better acting by r. dueringer in "hinterholz 8".

i'm a fan of judy garland, vincente minnelli, and gene kelly, but this movie just left me cold. i was expecting another american in paris from minnelli, so perhaps i was expecting too much.the movie was short on songs and short of impressive dance numbers. i was impressed by the very expressionistic kelly dance as mococo on the ship. i was also impressed by the nicholas brothers in be a clown, too bad the song was so annoying. i also enjoyed judy attacking kelly with bric-a-brac. check lorna luft's autobiography for some interesting information on that scene.actually, the movie has what must be some of cole porter's most annoying songs, especially "nina". also, judy and gene yell constantly like screechy children.the plot is thin--which is par for the course for musicals--but it is not saved by impressive dance numbers or by memorable songs. i suspect the best parts of this movie were left on the cutting room floor. please, some movie restorer, find those bits of film and show us what the movie could have been!

well!! the movie has catherine zeta jones in it. it's a hallmark television movie. it's from a thomas hardy novel. it has catherine zeta jones in it. she is by far the only one in the movie who acts better than in my high school theater class. oh yes it has clive owen in it. i'm not british so that means almost as much as being a thomas hardy novel. except he was in "the bourne identity", and i liked that. that just about wraps it all up folks. that really all there was. i'm becoming repetitive, but i do like czj, so i stuck it out to the end. the computer is telling me that i don't have 10 lines and i keep counting them. i always count 11, but maybe it just doesn't like my style, but that is my opinion of the movie, too.

i saw this hallmark television movie when it originally aired. i lost interest in the story because a character was said to be a witch. i just was not in the right frame of mind to watch this film. but hallmark stands for the best, quality films. now, there is a reason to give this film a second look. clive owen who plays "damon wildeve" just might have a chance to be selected as the next james bond 007 when pierce brosnan passes it on. clive owen might have to wait until the year 2008. the other reason is the female lead is catherine zeta-jones is now a celebrity (she was an unknown at the time) and became an academy award winner for outstanding supporting actress in 2003. joan plowright as "mrs. yeobright" is also in this film. i like the opening line in this film: "deliver my heart from this fearful, lonely place. send me a great love from somewhere or else i shall die, truly i shall die."

i rented this because i couldn't pass up the chance to see pre-hollywood-fame clive owen and catherine zeta jones together, but it definitely wasn't worth it. the only reason i give it two stars instead of one is for the novelty of seeing them before they made it big across the pond.zeta jones, who is usually fun to watch even if she isn't the greatest thesp in the world, is awful. owen seems really uncomfortable to be in such a turkey, plus he wears a ridiculous, egregiously ill-fitting chin-length wig (at least i hope that's a wig and not his real hair). and the scene where he dances a country jig with zeta jones just makes you embarrassed for him. joan plowright walks around in a daze the whole movie -- she's probably wondering how she got herself into such a mess.the actress who plays clive owen's wife isn't terrible, but just about everyone else is. oh, and the writing stinks too.

this film is an almost complete waste of time. i am studying the book for my english a level, and the film only contributes in one way, and that's getting across that the whole scenario is set in a rural idyll. the acting is wooden, the filmography is laughable, and the so called dramatic scenes in the film had the majority of my class (including me) snickering into their texts. the book, although not my favourite literary choice, is miles better than the film is, and the sound track is just plain irritating. don't watch this film unless you are looking for a timeless, quality storyline transformed into mindless, media waste.

remember the wooden, undramatic literary adaptations of the 1970s at their worst? you will when you see this broadly acted, unintentionally hilarious piece of chocolate-box adaptation. most culpable of all is catherine z-j who, while undeniably easy on the eye, substitutes swishing a big dress and looking sultry for actually turning in a performance. played po-faced like a melodrama, or cold comfort farm without the jokes, this effort is not helped by a scriptwriter with a tin ear for dialogue who misses entirely the novel's sense of irony or tragedy. a shame, given the quality of the acting talent on offer - joan plowright, claire skinner, steven macintosh all deserve better than this.

thomas hardy is one of my favorite authors. some truly wonderful movies have been made from his novels ("far from the madding crowd," "tess of the d'urbervilles," "the mayor of casterbridge"), and i had high hopes for this one. the hallmark-hall-of-fame-ification of "return of the native" totally wrecked it. the cast was terrific, the photography excellent, but the script was dismal and the direction positively ruinous. people walked up to people, said lines, walked away. a meager excitement developed when clive owen and catherine zeta jones (very young, very beautiful) exchanged a bit of flesh-pressing, but even clive, who is a superb actor, couldn't save it. it was awash with the usual hallmark "romantic" strings background music and pretend bumpkins offering plot exposition, and what could have been dynamite turned out to be awful. the richness of the above three movies was commpletely absent.

a couple of teenagers have a little sex on the beach in the 1960s. that's all. they say they are fifteen while one of the actors is really twenty-five. maybe this movie was somewhat revolutionary in 1978 in its way of touching `taboo' topics but i can't imagine that at that time anything shown in esmiko limon was regarded as tabooish.shallow dialogues are mixed with disco music that is even shallower. the selection of songs doesn't involve anything but the very very well-known `classics' that are still heard on every second radio station today. the plot of american pie is not much different but it is at least a little bit funny. eskimo limon is dull, flat and not aesthetic. almost unbelievable that it had six sequels!

this must be the first movie i've rented and not seen to the end. complete garbage! the acting, the plot, set and wardrobe looked like it came from a porno movie with a plot. not even a b move.

this is a weak throw-together of just about everything: refugees, croatia-slovenia relations, globalization, sexual orientation.. a very big clumsy metaphor about slovenia being at the cross roads between its past, which is symbolized by everything "virgin" becoming queen of the household, and its future, which is symbolized by listening to music in clubs and being a lesbian and never having kids.it plays on a rather recent slovenian legend involving a virgin and a "forest king" assuming the shape of a goat (zlatorog beer's imagery is also based on that legend), but unfortunately, the treatment is very incoherent. weiss seems to think the end justifies the means: she can use all kinds of "dream-like" sequences, and then pick and choose which ones true, and which ones are imaginary. how can the ride in the jeep with the "forest king" be real for all three girls, but the scene outside the tent be real only in simona's imaginary ? the ending just drags on and on (i can't believe the movie's runtime is only 98 minutes, have i been watching a director's cut without knowing it?), with the three girls having to look at the camera for about 10 seconds while looking afraid and happy at the same time (so obvious).i never thought i could spot bad acting in a movie whose language i don't understand, but it didn't take long to see that "simona" is over-acting most of the time, as if she was playing in a silent movie.it wasn't so bad as i kept thinking the director was just starting and wanted to capture what she thought her generation was all about on film by doing a half-experimental movie, until i realized that the director was actually 37 years old when making the movie and that her work is probably "serious".

i can confidently say that this is the worst film i have ever seen, and i usually love foreign films. the movie is nothing more than poorly-made violent pornography. if you choose to see it, prepare yourself for endless sexism, gratuitous nudity shots, and a stupid sensationalized rape scene, which i'm sure is the main appeal for the people who like the movie. additionally, the plot meanders aimlessly, and none of the characters is likable. many scenes are filmed from the woods surrounding the river the girls are on to give a constant feeling that someone is stalking them, which was a pathetic attempt to make up for the lack of story to tell.perhaps i wouldn't have wasted my time to see the movie, if it had been accurately described in reviews.

three young college women, simona (iva krajnc), alja (tanja potocnik), and zana (pia zemljic), go on an adventure canoing down the river kolpa, dividing their slovenia from neighboring croatia, in this 2002 slovenian film by maya weiss. what could have been an eastern european version of the well-known and exciting 1972 "deliverance" turned out, for me, to be utterly uninspiring with flat character portrayals that denied sympathetic identification with the characters.alja and zana are not convincing as students at all, though alja expresses a desire to be a writer, and both use what seemed to me to be excessive bad language. alja is bored with her boyfriend and seems to just be drifting along in life. zana, even less scholarly, is a self-absorbed adventure seeker with an attraction to other women. i had some sympathy with relatively innocent simona, conservative and starry eyed. the very idea of these three traveling together just doesn't work for me. the disdain that zana and alja show toward simona makes no sense - why would they choose her as a travel companion to start with as surely they must know her demeanor and attitudes?the three begin a carefree journey down the river on two canoes, undeterred by a news story of a woman's disappearance along the river. things become more somber with the mysterious appearance, sometimes real and sometimes possibly hallucinatory, of a rabidly conservative fisherman politician (jonas znidarsic).i did enjoy the scenes along the river and of small villages the trio visit. it may be because of a lack of cultural understanding, but the film didn't move me otherwise. i was surprised to see that the film has won some awards.

half a mystical thriller and half the fractured fantasies of a fragile mind, "guardian of the frontier" is an engaging trip that soon derails. strong imagery and a compelling premise is soon overwhelmed by incoherent plotting, hackneyed dialogue, amateurish acting, and the most outlandish and over-the-top phallic imagery in recent memory (here, a fish is most definitely not just a fish!). evidently, this is the first slovenian feature film to be directed by a woman -- ms. weiss must have been determined to prove that she could be as lurid and gratuitously explicit as any man.

it's funny... one day before i have seen this movie i had been watching a documentary about leni riefenstahl, so comparison kind of came automatically... of course there isn't any :) this movie is weak in every aspect... acting is not convincing (especially the one who plays simona...) and unnatural..., editing in confused and always leaves a taste of unfinished shot, music doesn't fit, the story doesn't flow, it gets boring and the movie comes out much longer as it is... oh, and the characters aren't very well shown, you actually can't tell much about the girls (except what you see)... the movie also tries to shock with explicit cursing (which is very laughable :)so... 2/10

after hearing that some of the people behind the low-budget flicks "terror in rock'n'roll önsjön" and "it came from outer space... and stuff" were involved in making this movie, i decided to buy it unseen on dvd. i wish i hadn't. the other movies were funny, tongue-in-cheek and kinda stupid. while kraftverk 3714 is devoid of any humor at all. and it is so god-awful that i'm getting angry just thinking about it. the worst actors possible, the worst script possible, the worst special effects available. and the most unsexy sex scene ever. uhhh. and the whole thing goes on for 2 hours and 45 minutes. please, do not ever make another movie.

being a completely broke film buff with a house to furnish, i'm a big fan of ikea. my whole domicile, practically, is packed to the brim with the cheap particle-board stuff. and you know how all those stylish household items at ikea have those funny names--a bookshelf called "holika" and a bathroom mirror called a "grundtal"--well, it just adds to the whole euro-charm.like those interestingly-named (but horribly translated) items on the shelves at ikea, i'd like to provide a bit of translation to some of the reviews i've read about the swedish-made "kraftverk 3714." original comment: "for a low budget film, this is pretty cool stuff. it would be great to see what these guys could do on a hollywood budget!"translation: the film stock is crappy, the lighting is pedestrian, the cinematography is uninteresting, the sound recording is hollow.original comment: "david lynchesque sci-fi drama set in a strange forest town with equally strange characters!" translation: these "actors" are acting for free, the storyline is circular and tiring, the ideas that undergird the flick desperately try to be existential but are simply mundane, and the settings (especially the interiors) are dull and filled with ugly wallpaper.original comment: "the editing is well-done, and the conservative use of computer graphics shows that compelling cgi effects don't have to come out of a hollywood studio!"translation: when you've got sketchy cinematography to begin with, hide the imperfections by digitizing all of it onto a mac and blending vigorously for three minutes. ingenious!i took a chance on this dvd because i'm a sucker for independent films, especially those that attempt to tackle the often-expensive and awe-inspiring genre of science fiction. i mean, some of the best sci-fi flicks of all time have been realized with little or no budget, spfx, and specious actors. take peter fonda's eco-warning-time-travel flick "idaho transfer" for example! a classic.but "kraftverk 3714" doesn't fit the category of "carefully-crafted, low-key, idea-dependent sci-fi." it relentlessly focuses on characters that don't do much and don't say interesting things. it goes round and round in circles. it is much too long (this coming from a major tarkovsky fan). worse, its concept of "reality shifting aliens" is twilight zone fodder from 40 years ago. it's just not a well-made film -and i really wanted it to be, dammit!however, being the ikea fan i am, i did make one ground-shattering observation. first, anyone who has shopped at ikea knows how their tricky shopping carts work--all four wheels being multidirectional. the carts can spin a perfect 360 degrees, and it takes some familiarity to handle them like a pro, as any avid ikea shopper knows. well, i'll be damned, but one of the lead actresses in "kraftverk 3714" goes to some inky-dinky grocery store in the middle of nowhere and what is she pushing around? a multidirectional shopping cart! so, that's not an ikea invention after all, but is yet another wonderful invention (let's call it a "tacklebee" for the hell of it) from the land of hei-doo!

without being really the worst science fiction film ever made, or the worst i have seen, 'time under fire' is still much under average. the premises and the first 10-15 minutes are not that bad, it starts as a x-files story, combining bermuda triangle mysteries with time travel. pretty soon elements of other genres (too many) mix together, but the story never takes off beyond the level of interest of a tv series. soon, 'time under fire' quickly degenerates into a series of clichés, not only mixing altogether too many genres but also being unable to create anything memorable in suspense or special effects that would help viewers remember the movie until tomorrow. acting is bad, and the rhetoric lines in the script do not help at all.

where do i begin? the story was so bad, it must have been written in a high school film club! the acting was so wooden i felt sorry for the actors! one actor even reminded me of what a deer must look like when staring into a car's headlights! another actor has this constant look of being constipated! but it was the dialog that takes the cake! our hero says to his captors - all holding submachine guns - if you lay a finger on a female prisoner you will be dead. moments later, the strongest guard, built like a truck, and the only women prisoner go at it. when our fearless leader, who has this very annoying raspy gangster voice catches wind of this transgression, he calmly walks up to the guard, while machine guns are trained on him, and in a split-second snaps this giant guy's neck like he was breaking a tooth pick! he then gets back in line while all the villains with their machine guns do absolutely nothing, but essentially yell at him!i could go on and on! this movie is camp gem; and if you have any sense of humor, it's guaranteed to make you laugh so hard your eyes will tear!

drab, dreary and a total waste of my time. the plot is incomprehensible (so don't think about it too much). the acting is odd and wooden - i would have sworn that they were all professional body builders trying their luck at acting, but that might be an insult to body builders. there are no interesting special effects to redeem this disaster, but lots of fires, explosions, a gratuitous sex scene, etc. the only thing that caught my attention was that it takes place after a war between the us and iraq that somehow goes nuclear...hmmm. is roger corman psychic? let's hope that "iraq" was just a lucky choice for corman and that the rest of his scenario doesn't come true. 

who's responsible for these "behind the scenes" things? who are these actors? did they crawl out from beneath rocks? 'yuks, lots of yuks!' no. no yuks for me. only loathing and shame that i am a human being. i have to avert my eyes from the set, it's so embarrassing. in fact, i changed the channel.i've always had a problem with robin williams' non-stop 'i forgot my lithium today' rantings, but at least he's funny once in a blue moon. watching someone who isn't funny at all impersonating robin williams is like having each tooth in your head pulled slowly and sadistically, without novocaine, for all eternity.please stop making these absolutely horrifying tv movies. please.

arthur hunnicutt plays a very stereotypical role as a mountain man (probably the ozarks) who goes hunting with his favorite coon dog. however, the dog appears to be drowning when hunnicutt jumps in after him. it becomes obvious pretty soon that despite hunnicutt and his dog roaming about after leaving the water that they both died in the water--as no one responds when he talks to them and sees and hears people talking about his and the dog's death. yet, oddly, hunnicutt is really slow on the uptake and it takes him a while to understand they are talking about him! i think this was actually done as padding, as there really wasn't enough material to fill the half hour time slot.later, in the "surprise twist", he comes upon heaven--or at least his concept of the place. he's invited in, but since they won't allow dogs, he has other ideas! overall, reasonably well acted but of dubious spiritual value! with no twists or irony, this episode is a bit dull--not "twilight zone-y" enough for my tastes.

as a south african, living in south africa again after a 32 year stay in the uk, i am sorry to say that this movie is a huge disappointment. the three main problems i had with the movie was a) why swank and ejiofor - an american and a nigerian - to play the leads. this country is bursting with talent and has no need of imports... b) gillian slovo has been trading off her struggle credentials for years now. she's a very mediocre writer and even her novel doesn't stand up the flaccid direction of mr hooper... and c) hilary swank again, such a great actor, as proved in million dollar baby (but that's eastwood too), here dressed in the contemporary new york style whilst roaming freely around the poverty of the karoo. where was the consideration and sensitivity needed by the costumer and director? yes, the film is ultimately moving - how could it not be? - but the overall mood at the conclusion is one of tremendous letdown. heart's in the right place but needs a pace maker.

that is what this movie is. good god the special effects suck in this movie. it is difficult for anything to suck more than this movie's plot, but the special effects manage to pull it off. let me try to explain just how bad this movie is.first, there is the plot. there are four punk-ass teenage dirt bikers who are riding around in a forest in duluth, mn. one of them is a dumb-ass and tries a ridiculous jump and breaks his leg. a paramedic comes to help him, but gets stranded with them when the helicopter breaks. then all five realize that there is a forest fire, which we see is started by some guy dumping tons of gas all over the forest. all they show us is his boots, and they show scene after scene of this guys boots walking around dumping gas and starting fires. meanwhile, the teenagers try to escape the fire, only to find that boot man has somehow managed to get ahead of them (while they were speeding through the forest on dirt bikes!), dump gas all over the area they were riding through, and start more fires. he does this several times, and the paramedic finally catches him and starts him on fire. i won't spoil the ending, but this guy's resilience will have you shouting "what the bloody hell?!?!" at the screen. anyway, they are now surrounded by fire, and their only escape is through a mine which is filled with methane gas. yes, methane gas. i'm not even going to try to describe the ending, because it is too ridiculous, and you'll enjoy it more if you don't see it coming. which you won't, because you can't possibly expect what happens. this is because of the second major problem with this movie: consistency.is some semblance of consistence too much to ask for? apparently so. i cannot even count the number of broken limbs in this movie (they keep breaking arms and legs while crashing their bikes). i think each character breaks at least one limb, and several more than one. they then limp around until the scene ends, and then forget that they're supposed to have broken limbs. there is one scene where three of them who are supposed to have broken legs start dancing. but then their injuries suddenly return when the plot needs them to.finally, the cgi. if there is a hell, it consists of watching the fire in this movie. all they did for the forest fires is line the dirt paths with cgi fire. you can clearly see that the only cgi fire is along the paths, and all of the trees more than two feet from the path are left untouched. and then they zoom out and show the whole forest being engulfed in flames. it's hard to describe in words how ridiculous it looks, but i assure you that the ridiculousness is quite impressive.this movie is one of those so-bad-its-good types. there are some occasions where it descends into the painful-bad category, but for the most part it stays above the line and is laughably inept. i can't wait to check out the other nature unleashed movies that came in the four-pack with this one.

ah the sci-fi channel. how often do you disappoint me? quite often i think, do you ever show good movies? ok you have given me the great 'heroes' and the reasonably good 'the lost room' but they are series, and as for the movie well there really is nothing positive to say. bad acting, bad directing, terrible characters and a shallow story, and that is just for starters. i checked out the director allan a goldstien and was not surprised to find nothing of interest in his resume (in fact i am half thinking that this is a pseudo name). the premises of four motor bikers out motto-crossing in a national park when one of them has an accident that needs a park ranger to come rescue them only for them to get caught in a forrest fire is weak and predictable that you know every beat before it happens. leading man bryan genesse the park ranger is so bad it is terrible. cast as the action hero martial arts boy in the footsteps of so many others this guy makes seagal and van damme look like de nero. the supporting cast are little better and well before the end one was left hoping the fire would engulf them all then the film crew. avoid at all costs

i thought it will be a ok movie after seeing the commercials about it. it was funny at some parts and some very nasty. the only person i felt sorry for is horatio sans who got a hot wife who is cheating on him with other women. but he never got a chance to have a threesome with until the and that was good but they should have made more bigger thru out the film.

this movie is one of the worst i've ever seen. even being hangover didn't help. the plot is lousy, if existent. the relatively large number of beautiful girls are unable to help. i guess seeing an episode of temptation island with the sound turned of would give the same kind of experience. do not see this flick

the guidelines state that a comment must contain a minimum of four lines. that is the only reason i am saying anything more about tomcats. because after all, my one line summary really says everything there is to say. there is absolutely nothing remotely entertaining in this film.

this movie, quite literally, does not have one redeeming feature. the characters are one-dimensional, cliched, incredibly misogynistic and stupid. the script looks as if it was cobbled together from 100 other movies, the acting is horrible, and some of the 'gross-out' humour made me feel nauseous.shame on you, gregory poirier, for thinking any of this would be funny or interesting!the worst movie i've seen in several years.

rare and auspicious are the moments in film-making when greatness stands as a defining monument for the rest of the industry to measure themselves against and for us to immerse in that glorious moment.some stories transcend their time and aspire to the lofty reaches of a classic and the stuff of legends. throw in the refined skills of an ensemble cast of thespians who are at the very top of their game."where has all the originality gone?" it is here, as this story and it's cast sashay through a plot and story that will not only educate but also entertain even the most seasoned of shakespearean/action/love story connoisseurs.i cannot begin to imagine where the writers dreamed up this extraordinary tale. where do geniuses get this kind of inspiration? i now have hope for mankind, knowing that this kind of talent still exists gives me hope that we will make it to the stars and beyond, perhaps to the very gates of heaven.i have, like others before me, dreamed of greatness. though i did not write this movie i did see it and because of this movie's noble greatness, i feel as if i have been elevated to a higher level of being, a higher level of spiritual wholeness.it is no wonder this kind of glory eludes most of us. what would become of our world if we all could attain this level of magnificence? we would probably be consumed in a white fire of super-nova glory as we evolve into trans-dimensional spiritual beings capable of omnipotent creative power.the most important thing to know, with all your heart and the very essence of your being, is that "tomcats" is nothing like what i have been talking about. "tomcats" is the antithesis of all i mentioned. it could very well destroy our world. for as some reviewers rate a movie on a star system, i.e. 1 through 5 stars, or even zero stars, i'm going to rate "tomcats" a black hole.i am willing to donate money to a cause that will put a stop to these kinds of atrocities that, as of late, seem to be running amuck at box offices. i'm not even adverse to the use of nuclear weapons. it must stop. how much more of this can we take before aliens from outer space come down here and blow up our planet because we have so many stupid, crass, vulgar, unimaginative, and degrading movies spewing out of hollywood? i'm not even going to dignify this movie by mentioning anyone's name that starred or produced it. i'm not even going to waste my time describing the story, since we've seen it a ba-zillion times, and all of the past versions were at least a ga-zillion times better.by the way my head nearly imploded during this movie, but with supreme selfless effort and lots-o-luck i survived to warn the public. you have been warned.

if you want to see someone accidentally eat another man's testicle, or look at a row of pathetically fake hard-ons at a wedding, or listen to a man talk about how good it felt to have sex with a girl while she was throwing up, then this is the movie for you. alternating, in neck breaking fashion, between romantic and gross out comedy, tomcats is certainly interesting. the lovely jaime pressly plays the wife of horatio sanz(tell me another one) who is found in many silhouetted situations with other women, but there is, surprisingly, no nudity. jake busey is thoroughly revolting as a hound dog who you wouldn't want as your friend. shannon elizabeth and jerry o'connell are both good and make a convincing couple, but the movie is far too busy trying to disgust to be any good.

here's the spoiler: at the end of the movie, a little piece of you dies. you'll spend the rest of your life searching in vain for that missing piece, but it's gone, it's gone. you'll wander the streets at night peering into your neighbors' windows as they sit down for dinner. friends and family will try to pinpoint when exactly you turned into the walking dead. you'll answer their questions and concerns with a blank stare and some mumblings about a runaway testicle. when amc inevitably makes tomcats the "movie of the month," a series of mysterious murders will take place in your city. you'll wake up the next morning balled up on the floor of the kitchen with a faint taste of brains in your mouth. then you'll crawl into the living room and onto the couch. you'll stare at the wall, wet yourself a little and then begin to laugh maniacally. because once your dead inside, jake busey in a thong is actually pretty damn funny.

don't see this movie! it's... repulsive! the start is indeed very good, but in the middle everything falls and i really regret spending 80 crowns (about 11 dollars) on the ticket! peter dalle should consider this as his last chance to gain peoples interest. awful picture! the only bright spot is the splendid work of robert gustavsson, lena nyman and gösta ekman.hope you take my advise... the picture is rubbish.

horrible, misogynist drivel. my neighbor brought this turkey over, subjected me to it, and didn't have the courtesy to apologize. the plot was laughable, my four year old could write a better movie.

this is movie is garbage, it looked really funny on the previews but i didn't laugh once through the whole movie. do yourself a big favor and don't waste your money on this, don't waste anyone's money on this. i gave it a 1/10 believe me i would have given it less if i could have. i'm a 15 year old guy and i thought it was trash if you wanna see a good movie go out and see jay and silent bob strike back.

right then. this film is totally unfunny, puerile, has gags from other films, has songs from other films (blink 182's "mutt", grand theft audio's "we luv u"), an unlikeable leading man, a ridiculous plot, and lame parodies of films like mission impossible 2 and american beauty. redeeming features? shannon elizabeth and jaime pressly. enough said.

highly flawed but just about watchable `comedy' that runs like a farrelly brothers reject. the most criminal thing about it though is the casting. i couldn't for one minute believe jerry o connell and jake busey in the role of superstuds, who could pull any woman at the drop of a hat, nor could i believe (the very beautiful) shannon elizabeth as a streetwise tough cop!. story is predictable but does manage to raise a titter on a few occasions, although, the `gross out', meant to be `shock comic' scenes, (one involving an amputated testicle, and another set in a sperm bank) are just plain awful. if this film is on tv then its probably worth watching if you are extremely bored, but please don't waste your money renting it!!

what can you say about a movie whose funniest episode sees a fat man wrestling a garden hose? the acting, particularly that of lead man jerry o'connel, is embarrassing. the dialogue is so contrived and unfunny it makes you cringe. the controlling idea is actually not a bad one for this genre (infantile teen comedy), but, somehow, the director manages to make the least of it. i rate it a 2 out of 10.

i mostly rented this movie to see shannon elizabeth. she played well in this movie, but the plot sucked. the movie wasn't really about anything just about trying to stay single after making a pact when one of jerry o' connell's friends gets married. the other friends put together this money and who's ever last to get married get's the money ($10,000) from all his friends. anyway the movie just try to follow through by making no since and trying to make it more funny then making since. i'm glad i only paid .50 for this movie. it really wasn't good at all. i rated it **** out of 10 stars!

i had expected a fairly straightforward r-rated graphic, sexual, crude teen-comedy when i sat down to see this... it turned out to be fairly accurate... only it was far more sick and disgusting than i would have thought. i don't know if the director/writer gregory poirier is sick or deeply messed up sexually, but i doubt that a normal person could have made a movie like this. i could probably have taken it if it was just that, if the only thing that was wrong was it was that it required a tough stomach... but it isn't. the film is also horribly mean-spirited and disturbing... every single character that has more than one full second of time on-screen is an extreme... sexually, mentally or physically. i don't know if this is just the director's sense of humor, but i just found it to be... wrong. just wrong. even in a comedy, there is supposed to be some seriousness. the plot is stupid. the acting is bad. the characters are inconsistent and poorly written... all of them. there isn't one single likable character in the film. the humor is disgusting and goes way too far. the film is just so incredibly poorly done that i really don't think it's worth anyone's time. if you like r-rated, crude comedies with plenty of sexual innuendo and graphic stuff, watch the groomsmen, or, better yet, american pie... or road trip, my personal favorite. but don't watch this. i can't possibly describe to you how bad it is... you would have to experience it for yourself. however, this is one of those times where i'll say that you're better off wondering. that way you can just imagine that this film goes very close to the bottom... without knowing that it goes through it, and far lower than that. this movie most of all looks like a group of horny teenage guys got together, put together a film crew, and every-time one of them got an idea, they filmed it, and later put the entire thing together. it lacks structure, consistency and taste. i recommend this only to horny teenage guys who have seen every single other r-rated crude teen comedy and who don't care about quality. everyone else... do the sensible thing; avoid this. it's not even worth it to see the booty. believe me. 1/10

** black dragons (1942) william nigh ~ bela lugosi, joan barclay, clayton moore "just prior to the start of world war ii, dr. melcher (bela lugosi), a world-famous surgeon, is brought in by japan's black dragon society as part of a secret plan. dr. melcher operates on six black dragon society operatives and transforms them into exact duplicates of 6 high ranking american businessmen who are replaced by these look-alikes. with their operatives in place, the black dragon society's plan to sabotage the american war effort appears to be set but, the f.b.i. chief and an agent begin to piece together the clues that hopefully uncover this sinister plot," according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis.that synopsis gives away the entire ending; which, in this case, might be a good thing. "black dragons" is an incredible, wildly inconsistent muddle. a wiser course of action would have been to stay with the teasing supernatural angle. in early scenes, mr. lugosi (as monsieur colomb) is effectively creepy. confusing joan barclay (as alice saunders), future "lone ranger" clayton moore (as dick martin), along with a cast of old stage and silent veterans do the best they can with a story that looks as if filmmakers were making it up as they went along.

when a group of businessmen start dying in the presence of the mysterious mr. coulomb, fbi agent dick martin is assigned to the case. as the deaths continue to mount, mr. martin obviously isn't having much success. by the end of the movie, the strange truth is revealed, which i won't reveal here.one of the other users commenting on this states "this is a classic film and should be enjoyed and not picked apart". i'm sorry but i have to respectfully disagree with this opinion. it is "classic" only in that it is old, not in any sense pertaining to its quality. i've enjoyed a lot of low budget "b" movies from around this time period, but this isn't one of them.the pacing is unbearably slow, the camera work is pretty bland, most of the acting is fairly wooden (even lugosi isn't great in this one in my opinion) and the plot, while it has an interesting premise, seems to be thrown together in a very difficult to follow manner.

first - nick-623, pearl harbor was bombed in 1941, not 1942. they didn't have to predict the bombing.second - did nobody notice these six industrialist/lawyers/whatever were missing for a rather long amount of time? they were killed *before* the surgery took place! third - how the heck did lugosi get out of cabs without being seen? fourth - why did the japanese not just kill him, instead of putting him in jail with a convenient look-alike companion and his surgical kit? fifth - oh, what's the use? this movie has a few interesting moments in it, but by the time they explain what's going on, you'll probably have stopped watching. if not, you won't care.

if i could give this movie a negative rating i would. the humor is the cruelest i have ever seen in a film. horrible things happen to good people and people who have already suffered horribly through no fault of their own. there are 2 plots, neither of which supports half of a film. where is the "depth" others see in this movie? that no good deed goes unpunished? that only the heartless can succeed? the film does start well and the black and white is very moody and well done. the acting is very good and convincing witch makes the cruel humor even more horrifying. if you think that the 3 stooges are too nice to each other, if watching the beheading of a kidnap victim with a bowie knife is a real thigh slapper, if you thought "schindler's list" was hilarious, then this movie is for you.

bela lugosi is a real enigma. in the early 1930s, he was on top of the world after appearing in dracula. yet, again and again, he made lousy decisions regarding his career. perhaps he had a bad agent, perhaps his drinking and drug use had a part in it or maybe he was just crazy. regardless, he ruined his reputation by appearing in pretty much any film--ranging from excellent horror films (such as the raven) to big-budget flicks (like ninotchka) to grade-z flicks for the cheapest and shoddiest of studios. interestingly enough, although he agreed to do this terrible film, he actually turned down the role that later went to boris karloff in frankenstein! as for this movie, it is a very silly an horridly produced wwii propaganda film that featured a dumb plot and wretched editing. lugosi spends much of the movie murdering saboteurs--not a bad thing at all. but at the end, we find out that he is himself a nazi plastic surgeon and all the american-looking men he killed were actually japanese!!!! the funniest part of this is during a flashback. you see lugosi talking to a group of japanese men before he changes them to american-like men. when the camera scans them, the men are clearly asian. but, on all the other non-close-up shots, they are all very western looking--many with bald heads!! they looked absolutely nothing like japanese men. i suspect the plot must have undergone a re-write and this might account for the obvious mistake. or, it could just be shoddy production values and editing. in fact, early in the film, they show a street scene in the city and all the cars (circa 1942) are old model t fords--obviously from stock footage!!! the bottom line is that the film is bad but also very dull. unlike plan 9 from outer space, it's hard to laugh at the ineptitude--just be put to sleep by it.

set in 1945, skenbart follows a failed swedish book editor who decides to take a non-stop train to berlin. unfortunately for everyone around him, he's a walking disaster, causing mayhem everywhere he goes. the train also holds a man and his mistress scheming to murder the man's wife (who's also on the train), a soldier on his way home, two gay elderly gentlemen, an angry train conductor, two nuns, a bunch of refugees, and even more people.meant as a mix of noir-ish thriller (which it does quite well - at least to begin with), and comedy, the film fails with both. it doesn't sit right as the film changes tone with every new scene. and as the train races towards its final destination, the film turns more and more bizarre, ending on a truly surreal note.the good bits are wasted in a myriad of pointless plots and characters. skenbart is packed with famous swedish actors, no matter how small the part is. it feels like the filmmakers rang everyone they've ever worked with and offered them a part in the film. too bad that the performances are just as bad as the script (act your lines - don't read them!).the comedy is more or less slapstick, with the same jokes repeated over and over. the pace is incredibly slow at times (quite often, actually) with on scene in particular dragging on for about ten minutes for no good reason. the screenwriter also seems to think that swearing is a good way to replace decent dialogue. the film looks great though, in moody b&w, but it's wasted on such inept film-making in every other department. [1/10]

outside sweden you are not expected have seen this movie. happy you. the cast includes several actors that are important part of modern the swedish movie history. and still.. seems like peter dalle only had a an idea lasting for about 20 minutes. robert gustafson is totally misused in this movie, trying to copy a younger gösta ekman. ekman, by the way, is the only actor fulfilling the expectations. credit that can be given is for the photo, splendid idea using black and white. music is ok.but over-all it's a waste of god actors and the time of the audience.

i had this movie given to me, and have to admit, i am glad that i did not pay money for it.the back of the box makes it seem like some kind of sex triangle, with 2 women trying to seduce her. but the reality in this movie is far from that.in reality, the main subject is the victim of a vicious and sadistic rape by the two other characters. there was absolutely nothing in this that i found interesting at all.even movies like silence of the lambs and wild things (which the box tries to compare this movie to) were riveting, because of the unexpected turns and suspense.but jaded has none of this. it concentrates on the rapeists and the sick relationship with the boyfriend of one of them. and the persuit of a videotape that may prove the victims story is true.while it does show that same sex rape is possible, it is not a movie worth watching.if at all possible, pass this movie up at all costs.

"jaded" offers a premise with potential as it looks at the rape of a woman by two other women and ask the question "when is rape not rape?". unfortunately the flick seems to suffer from bad direction as it slogs through legal minutia while trying to weave some kind of story with a handful of foul mouthed and poorly portrayed characters only to end abruptly. "jaded" is lame stuff only for the bleary-eyed couch potato in the mood for some dark drama.

hard to imagine what they were thinking of when they made this movie (i.e., the writers, directors, producers, actors, editors, etc.). christopher plummer, veteran of 129 movies, frolics along among scores of other actors with apparently no more motivation than to collect a paycheck. i guess there is nothing wrong with that, but once they are paid that doesn't mean anyone has to watch it.it bugs me that there are actually good reviews for this movie here at imdb. art? if you want to see art go to an art gallery, don't watch this movie. comedy? watch a re-run of the flintstones, about the same plot with less time wasted.dabney coleman gives his usual performance, for better or worse. and some of the young actors may have gotten some good experience from doing this movie. but plummer???? it was embarrassing to watch his performance, in fact i was positively transfixed on him throughout the movie, knowing this was plummer of sound of music fame! i see from his bio that he called sound of music "sound of mucus", so guess he didn't like it as much as the 100's of millions who liked him in it.i wonder if today he was asked, how do you rate sound of music compared to where the heart is, what would he say.....?probably something like "where the money is"....

i'm a boorman fan, but this is arguably his least successful film. comedy has never been his strong suit, and here his attempts at screwball farce are clumsily done. still, it's almost worth seeing for boorman's eye for talent: this is one of uma thurman's first starring roles, and as always she is ravishing to watch. (on a sad side note, boorman wrote the script with his daughter, telsche, who died a couple years ago.)

i say this. if you want to see art, you go to an art gallery. if you want to see a movie, you go to a theater. trying to intertwine art and film proves disastrous in "where the heart is". an interesting cast is totally wasted in this embarrassment. you like dabney coleman, see "short time". you like crispin glover, see "bartleby". you like uma thurman, see "kill bill". above all, if you like christopher plummer, see "the silent partner", because his character here, is a terrible embarrassment. in fact this entire production is an embarrassment. sure the human artwork is intriguing for a few minutes, so make a short, but do not subject an audience to pointless nonsense, masquerading as filmed entertainment. - merk

after seeing this piece of crap you will know why the limeys drive on the left side of the street...this movie is an absolute no-brainer! the jokes (if this is the right word for it...) are mostly sub-standard (about 98%) and do miss any punch-line at all. save the money and get drunk. you might enjoy this movie being totally wasted, perhaps!

if jacqueline mckenzie and john lynch weren't such talented actors this film would probably be even worse than it actually is.the story of two mentally disturbed people who fall in love and have a baby is an interesting one,and well worth exploring.however on the negative side,the plot becomes increasingly over the top as the story progresses,and the music choices more and more bizarre,so that by the end i found myself laughing when i know the director intended for me to be crying.

this is a truly awful movie. the jokes are few and far between and the pacing is a down right endurance test. the only thing funny to come out of this production is it's comparison to the classic film "this is spinal tap."avoid this film as if it were one of the plagues of the bible itself.

joe rogan's whole act is profanity laced with bile. he is a pot smoker who entered fear factor, thinking it was a joke. he said he would egg people on because he did not know how stupid people were going to be. the producers of the show he explained were going on the premise of playing pranks on unsuspecting contestants to see how far they will go. the level of evil involved is a little twisted. mr. rogan's special is just filled with the rants of someone who is too good for regular human beings. i found him to be offensive and his stuff can be heard by more talented comedians such as eddie murphy or chris rock. rogan even does a five minute set on the n word. overall, ignore this special.

this person is a so-called entertainer who has to resort to profanity, vulgarity, and slander to try and make others believe he has talent. i have often seen comics use a little of each with effect but when all you can say is laced with it, it is a sign of a drug affected warped mind. makes me wonder where his twisted and fried brain will be in a few more years of abuse. poor man!!! i admit i could not watch all of it - too stupid for words. the amazing part of this is that somebody actually believes he is a philosopher!!! no wonder self respect and decency are dwindling and perversity is rising. could it be that the ufc might have been a factor in his deadened brain?

it really is terrible, from start to finish you'll sit and watch this ridiculous idiot, thinking hes cool when he's really not, rubbish plot line, terrible acting and complete waste of time and money, do not bother.

i haven't seen many movies worse than this one. the story line, the dialogues, the acting: it's horror! the story just jumps from a to b to c without any logical steps in between. every time you think you've missed something, but no: that was the way it was intended to be. and why on earth is the character that jenny garth portrays so in love with that no-no loser guy (who actually now plays in the movie cinderella man with russel crow!)? o well, it's no spielberg, of course... i have to write ten lines to get posted. this movie really isn't inspiring enough to write 10 lines! it's a romantic feel good movie with a lousy story, so if you're up for that: you'll have a ball.

i accidentally happened upon this movie when i was looking for something to watch while eating lunch. i actually turned to the we network because it said it had the last 20 minutes of some movie about the importance of "sticking it" for some gymnastics team -- i figured cheesy goodness. well, i got cheesy alright. first, i missed a good 20-40 minutes at the start of the movie. luckily, most of it was recapped fairly quickly, especially in the bedroom scene where crystal admits that she felt responsible for the death of her rapist.i love jenny garth and will watch her in just about anything. she's just so pretty, and i want my lipstick to look as perfect as hers always does. she looks great throughout this movie, and doesn't really age over what seems to be more than a decade. overall, i felt bad for the actors as i watched this movie. all of them tried to sell their parts, but all were so poorly written that it was a constant struggle. frankly, i was surprised to see terry farrell and mitch ryan (greg's dad from dharma & greg) in this. but the writing was not the worst part of this movie. about a half-hour before the end, her mother dies, and when they show the headstone the death date is 1979. having missed the beginning, i had gotten the impression from the wardrobe that this was taking place in the 80s. not one leisure suit or bell bottom in sight. shame on the person who did wardrobe for this film! don't get me wrong -- all the outfits in this movie were beautiful, but they were completely wrong for the time period. it almost makes me wonder if they told the wardrobe person that it was a period piece.bottom line -- good for a laugh or to feed a jennie garth fix. :)

it's schmaltzy, but then what else did you expect? the heroine is cinderella's younger sister complete with wicked mother, sister, and brother-in-law; the hero (if you can call him that) is an ineffectual putz; and the rival love interests are full of melodramatic villainy.the cast, settings, and wardrobe were all very attractive, and i thought the actors did a superb job considering how weak the material was. the movie was prettily filmed and boasted a soundtrack that was carefully crafted to cue the viewer about what emotions he should be experiencing throughout. megon mcdonough sang sweetly and provided the film with some of its best moments.if you love danielle steel, you will love this film. if you love archetypal romance, you will love this film. i did not. i was able to sit through it, but it was close.

i like ali g's show, i believe the guy has comedic instinct, but hasn't (yet) developed it to a talent.the movie is a little worse than i was expecting. i don't find ali-g offensive, just stupid. jokes for 5-year olds, some good, some terrible.if you want to watch a movie that seems "offensive", but is actually funny, see tom green's 'freddy got fingered'.2/10

i had already heard of ali g in madonna's music video "music". i always think he's funny. (in fact, he really is.) just last year i always thought of buying a vcd of "ali g indahouse". that's why some months later, i bought it cheap and i started watching it.but the movie surprised me. my older brother and i were expecting it to be a great laugh-out comedy. it turns out that "indahouse" is just a stupid piece of garbage. it was really really bad. it also contains explicit sexuality content and very crude humor. it also didn't made me laugh, even just a big smile. we definitely hate that movie. oh by the way, i have plans to sell it.ali g was really different in his movie compared to his tv shows-- in such a negative way. maybe he wasn't really well-focused and enough serious to make this flick. just because there's some sex scenes in it doesn't mean it's freaking hilarious (because sometimes, too much isn't that laughable anymore). for the first time ever, i was disappointed at him. that really made me sad rather and happy.i gave this movie 1 over 10. actually, i really want to give it a 0 rating. it's one of the worst movies i've seen in my entire life. i wouldn't recommend to anyone who wanna watch good comedies that aren't too explicit or horrible.

don't tell me this film was funny or a little funny. it was a complete disaster, and one of the worst movies i've ever seen. ali g is only funny on channel 4's ali g show. after watching his performance, all i can say is he is not made for movies. with a daft script, or more like no storyline, there's nothing to keep you entertained. full of annoying, unrealistic character's this movie is a complete garbage all the way. at the end of the film, ali g gives a speech. he mentions, if you hated this film, tell people it was good. not even the speech could save the movie, he probably knew its gonna be a stinker. i would of given this a 0/10, but the minimum start is 1. overall, don't even waste your time on this rubbish.

bean, kevin & perry, uk tv creations that have made successful transitions onto the big screen. now its ali g's turn and i m afraid to say this is not one of them!ali has always been obscene but funny with it. this film was extremley sick and not funny at all. scenes involving bestiality, gay sex and paedophilia should not be portrayed for entertainment's sake.ali g in da house is rubbish and deserves making very little money.1 out 10

if i compare two films with sacha cohen, borat and ali g then ali g is immeasurably better. i'ts no master piece, but it's a film at least. borat is complete garbage and i do not understand how it rated better then ali g.i cannot put my finger on it, there something wrong with the ali g script: half of the jokes are as if written by a 15 years old, not by an adult scriptwriter. and a number of jokes including mr cohen's lower body are quite tasteless. but the film actually comes together as a comedy and there are some valid jokes too that are funny: such as how ali g becomes a member of government for doing something scandalous and stupid in the public (sadly true in today's western society: people get careers for doing stupid things in public), also ali's advice about immigrant policy and some others. ali g overall remains a sympathetic character, even though a kind of mentally underdeveloped for his age. but it's ok to watch,it's quite funny.but never ever watch borat, it's awful and makes every intelligent movielover sick.

my god how bad this is. who is this impostor pretending to be ali g? avoid this at all costs. it replaces the smart multi-layered satire and humour of his show with down and out toilet humour.this was obviously an attempt to get him known in the states before he released his show there on hbo.one commentator here pleads that we not judge the movie on the merits of the show due to the difference in the mediums. while it is true that the standard format of the show could never have been transferred to the big screen mr sacha baron cohen could have ensured the smart use of his comic style in a more conventional movie storyline. instead we have this mess, which in all honesty has nothing at all to do with ali g except for the packaging.terribly disappointing. go seek out the dvd's of innit, aiiii, or bling bling for some real ali g.

ali g was funny at first. his interviews were fresh and original. the idea of a mock gangster wearing ott clothes and using street wise lingo was appealing at first.but this film is just a rehash of old jokes, the humour was mainly childish and revolved around the male sex organ for the most part. the film claimed good actors like charles dance, but their talents were wasted as they played silly 2-d characters. it is not 'terrible' but isn't really funny at all a second time. it could be said that the movie was ali g's last bastion of comedy. after that he ran out of steam.

i have absolutely no idea why i watched ali g indahouse except for the fact that salon seemed to think a crime was committed by not nominating sacha baron cohen for a emmy for his work on da ali g show. it is a sure bet that i will never watch that show as there was absolutely nothing funny about the movie. comedy? torture was more like it. it was just about the stupidest thing i every watched. i will admit that i was captivated by rhona mitra. i had not seen her in anything. she wasn't on the practice during the time i was watching, so i guess i will have to check out boston legal one of these evenings to see how she does in something that may be worth watching.

may contain spoilers for about the last four years i've been a keen fan of ali g. sacha baron cohen is undoubtedly a very funny and intelligent guy and, in my view, his best creation is borat who's as funny as hell and quite shameless in what he does and says to people.anyway, to the movie. i didn't bother paying money to see this in the cinema; i suppose because i didn't expect a lot but when i hired the dvd recently, i found the whole thing pretty sad. the best part of ali's taking the mickey out of others was largely missing and the script an plot was pretty damned awful; hooking all the car batteries together to blow a safe - really!!?? this movie goes to show i think that some things can run for too long and definitely don't translate to the big screen. the movie also had that syrupy sweet ending that i've come to expect from british films. where have all the good british movie making ideals gone to? that said, there were the odd very funny moments such as the dog in ali's bed and ali's audience with hm the q with the "shaven haven - respect" remark.so, in summary, i am an ali g and borat fan and i have enjoyed many of his interviews (notably the one with anita roddick of the body shop) but this movie fell really flat with me. if there's to be another movie, i hope it's a whole lot better than this lot of old tripe.weasel100 canberra, australia

that's all i can really say about this film. it's dbz...like tree of might and the world's strongest, it really...doesn't fit into the timeline for the show at all, though it is supposedly placed just before the beginning of the tv series. the action is pretty nice in general. the plot has a nice enough base, with a good background establishing why these guys hate each other and all. pretty good in general, there... the problem is...there's a lot of really weird stuff. i mean, really weird stuff. like the world's strongest, there's a really, really odd song in this one that could only have been created in a drug induced haze...disturbing is the fact that gohan, while singing, is pretty much drugged out himself. creepy. the villains are odd and rather comical...moreso than the usual dbz type--this seems more like it was made as a dragon ball movie rather than a dragon ball z movie. in general, its entertaining enough, but...just...strange.

i sat last night to see this film being played in greek television because of the upcoming olympic games hosted by my city.knowing that it is an american film, i had already expected it to focus more on the american athletes story.and i was really ready for it. but what i saw was..., too much!i mean, when a movie has such a title ("first olympics: athens 1896"), even being of american origin, you would not expect it to be so propagandizing and, on the same time, ignorant towards other countries' athletes and efforts.the american athletes seem to have all the gifts of nature (strength, smartness, generosity, kindness, politeness...), in contrast to their "sin-athletes" in the games, who seem being unable even to... speak their thoughts or express feelings.the number of times the american anthem is played during the film must be an all time record in filmography.megalomania at it's best!it even uses fictionalized facts which ridicules the greek nation, such as greek citizens serving the foreign marathon athletes with wine, in order to help the domestic ones win the race.so much for the olympic spirit.think of it.being a greek and putting a bad mark to a movie whose title is also greek is something that doesn't make me happy at all.but according to what i have seen, i cannot give it more than 4 out of 10 (being pretty generous actually).

historically awful. scarcely an accurate moment in 4 hours of ridiculosity. one cannot keep track of the inconsistencies while watching. as with all track and filed movies, nobody bothers to ask for any track consultants. events and techniques that weren't even created until the next century are shown. from the shots of runners jogging in a 400 meters to the highly overweight actor portraying the high jump and long jump winner, one would have to know absolutely nothing about track to even be mildly entertained. likely thrown together in 1984 as a tribute to the games just prior to the la olympics.

**spoilers** with the title of the film having the name of the killer fish twice not once you would expect to see them in action attack biting ripping and eating up almost everyone in the cast of characters. instead you have to wait until the movie is almost over for you to get as much as a glimpse of the piranahs. even then all you see is the water bubbling and stirring around as a poor individual disappears under it assuming that he's being eaten, whole and alive, by the fish.the movie "piranha piranha" starts with this scary looking piranha on the screen as the credits start rolling down but****spoiler****that's the only time in the movie that you ever get to see the killer fish or fishes you never get to see a piranha is the movie again. what you do see is a travelogue of venezuela and it's people and the venezuelan jungle along the amazon river basin. together with a lot of nice and breathtaking photography of the landscape as well as the people and wildlife but that's about all.there is some kind of a story that has to do with this great white hunter caribe, william smith, which ironically means piranha in the native language spoken there, is this what the title of the film "piranha piranha" really meant? "caribe caribe"! the person caribe is played by legendary hollywood hell's angles biker and all around tough guy william smith.at the beginning of the movie this trio of american tourists jim pendrake and his sister terry, peter bown & ahna capri, and their american guide art green, tom simcox, are on their way into the venezuelan jungles to go sight-seeing with terry taking photos to send back home. terry is terrified of guns as we learn that as a young girl saw her father get his head blown off by a gun. even when art saves her life using one when see's attack by a six foot long diamondback rattlesnake terry almost belts him for having a gun; which he promised her he wouldn't take along with him on the trip.at a jungle rest stop, or bar, the three run into caribe who we first saw catching monkey's in the jungle at the start of the movie. caribe makes himself more then welcomed by the three with his knowledge of the jungle and his half-baked philosophy about life and death as well as his ability to get them where their going to the local diamond mines deep in the amazon basin.even though a bit strange at first, the guy is so in to himself that he doesn't seem to notice that there are any people around him, caribe turns out to be a swell and likable guy engaging in a long and friendly motorcycle race through the swamps and jungle with art. caribe even shows terry, who at one time in the movie almost knocked his teeth out, the fine points of hunting and shooting wild game that he believes don't really die but become a part of him after he kills them! a bit crazy but you have to admit this guy's got imagination. it's much later in the movie that for some strange reason, maybe it was the cheap booze that he was drinking, caribe suddenly goes insane and become homicidal attacking and raping terry and then murdering her enraged brother and feeding him to the deadly piranha's. trying to escape from the rampaging lunatic and then being forced to have to fight it out with him art gets beaten up so savagely by the dirty-fighting caribe that he's almost left unconscious. just when caribe's about to finally kill art he's shot to death by terry who after experiencing what this insane nut-job is all about finally decided that guns are indeed very necessary and should be used to kill on very rare but life-saving occasions.worth watching, if worth watching at all, only for the scenery and nothing else. it's just a shame that the movie has to advertise as a killer fish, or piranha, horror movie when if it was honest about itself it could have been a more or less average jungle adventure flick with smith, he does have the build for it, playing tarzan of the venezuelan, not african, jungle

this is an example of a movie that can have great potential and is executed very poorly.. i am a fan of kids and thumb sucker and many other so called teen angst films, but this one bugged me.why is every white kid made into a thug who loves rap, its getting to be one dimensional. the acting was awful but simple since it mainly consisted of just dropping f bomb after f bomb just a bad bad movie if you'd like to see better movies like this : thumb sucker kids bully allthose i think are better so i recommend one of those is you'd like to see a good "teen movie" i hope my comment you found useful and hope you hear future comments from me

this movie was outright painful for me to watch. i understand that indie films do not have the same resources as other mainstream films. but there are basic elements of film making that typically you want to adhere to. first off, jump cuts. there are numerous in the film's opening 15 minutes. there are shots in which it appears that two separate takes of the same shot were edited together. what i mean by this is a character will say half a line from one take, and the rest of the line is from a different take. secondly, the dialog. i understand that many writers strive for a very realistic and true dialog for their films. since this film is very specific to its location, the dialog must be spoken in a specific tone also (example: set a movie in boston, yet people use west coast slang with a chicago accent). even with understanding this, it is still hard to sit through some of the lines these actors present. these are only the two most vivid problems i encountered with this film. there were a few others. i do not mean to sound like a harsh critic who doesn't know a thing. i have years of experience in the film (more importantly the low budget indie film) industry. i also understand that with many directors there is often a method to their madness. i have been unable to discover this method used in this film. this makes it difficult when trying to decide whether i view this film as an example of unique style in film making, or just another low budget, poorly put together film. i honestly hope that it is not the latter. if anyone has any insight into why things were done a certain way, or has any thoughts/views of their own concerning this film, i would love to hear them. hopefully i can understand this film more and my current opinion can be changed.

i caught this during a brief run in a philadelphia theater. despite its local provenance (and its relation to a hometown tragedy, namely the beating death of eddie polec in 1994), i really have to come down hard on this movie. the director, for reasons best known to himself, decided to shoot the entire film guerilla-style, with nonstop handheld cameras and rapidfire cuts. such technique might work for the scenes of jarring violence, but is utterly inappropriate for the rest of the material, which makes up the majority of the film. a stroll down the sidewalk, a brother-to-brother discussion on a sofa, hell, even a kiss on a first-date are all shot cusinart-style, distracting this viewer from ever being able to enter into the drama. martin also undercuts his narrative by packing in far too many topics: besides the birth of mob violence, we get anorexia, alcoholism, divorce, racism, parental abuse...did i miss anything? no doubt a better cast (and a better-focused direction) would have knit these threads together, as martin surely intended, to demonstrate how one moral flaw leads into and sustains a host of others...but good intentions do not necessarily a great film make. just a sprawling mess. martin, i know you're from my town, and i'm down with you man, i really am...just do a better job next time, like you did in two plus one.

this movie just happened to be on hbo yesterday so i watched it. this was a mistake. i guess i got sucked in and kept watching although it was a lot like a train wreck, terrible, horrible, but somehow you just can't look away. shaudenfraud i guess! ; ).this is the story of a photoshoot for models on some island in the caribbean. one by one they are all murdered. one drinks cleaning fluid, one gets blown up on a waverunner, one goes over a cliff...so these are not accidents, but for some inane reason the police are never called and no one thinks that perhaps they should "wrap" the shoot and go home, not just in respect for the dead, but perhaps out of fear for their own lives. no. they just continue with their shoot because that is what's most important. forget about the dead models, we have a magazine to produce!one of the subplots is the evil magazine owner, played by lee majors, rex is his name. he is the most obvious suspect and every time a model gets killed he twirls his mustache and says "well, i can't say this won't be good for sales", mooo hoo hoo hoo ha ha ha ha". so absurd. another subplot is when it's revealed that rex is one of the models baby dady, only when he learned of the baby he tried to convince the girl to abort. she didn't, but always resented him for even suggesting this.they try to give you false clues and point toward some guy named raule, seemingly because he's the only one with an accent and "looks creepy".at the very end (sorry to spoil, but this movie came out years ago so if you haven't seen it by now...) one of the women was found face down dead in the pool. this was the last straw!!!! vanessa angel, forget her characters name comes at rex with a gun, they struggle, the gun fires and now she's dead too!!! while she's laying on the floor his business associate tells him that with all this bad press the magazine will be worthless and it's all his fault. he gets him to sign over the magazine to him. once he does voila! all the dead models come back to life and you find the entire thing was an elaborate ruse to get back at rex.oy! what a ridiculous movie. as someone else said; if you want to see something like this april fools day is far better!

so you've got a number of models on an island, and one by one they're picked off agatha christie-style. we get somebody lost at sea, pushed off a cliff, poisoned by a solvent, driven off a cliff, blown up, etc. nothing terribly graphic.before any of that starts, one woman inexplicably has a dream of a killer in a weird human face mask.the owner of the magazine is a sleaze who had an affair, and somebody had photos taken of her before she was of age.in the end, it's all about business, or something,there's an 80s style montage of a photo shoot, most of the bathing suits being one-pieces, surprisingly. a couple are fairly translucent. there's camera clicks during the montage where the frame of the camera appears as a white square or rectangle within the picture. the photographer is rather bad at framing!

"terror in the aisles" might look like the ultimate treat for horror fans but it has, in fact, very few to offer. granted, it presents a decent and versatile (too versatile?) selection of horror/thriller fragments that are considered classic but ...what's the point? this documentary primarily aims for the horror-loving public so we've pretty much seen all these clips already, haven't we? the only thing really praiseworthy about this project is the editing. if you're into scream-queens, chases by vile murderers and that sort of things, "terror in the aisles" has some neat compilations of the most famous sequences. all these different scenes hang together by a lame wraparound story starring donald pleasance and nancy allen sitting in a movie theater. in between two sequences, the address the viewer and "explain" why we love horror so much. those speeches naturally are soporific and rather obvious (it's in our nature to be afraid ...bla bla bla) and i fail to understand why many people love the concept. this is worth a peek in case you're a loyal horror fan but it certainly isn't essential viewing. on the contrary: in case you still have to see a classic genre title, beware that bits and pieces of it here don't spoil your future viewing. the main reason why i overall disliked it is because it shamelessly ignores a lot of lesser known, but fundamental (foreign) titles endlessly focusing on "halloween". this does result in a cool inside joke, however, when donald pleasance screams to the screen at his own character.

i used to think that "it came from hollywood" was the worst movie i had seen that showed clips from horror, sci-fi, crime and drama movies. of course, i hadn't seen this beauty yet.what's wrong with "terror in the aisles"? four things:1) it assumes that most of the great moments in shock cinema history began in the '70s when directors like john carpenter and brian de palma came along. and what bones are thrown to the true classics (i.e. - the black and white films) like "frankenstein", "dracula" and "the wolf man" are either shown with martin and lewis or abbott and costello alongside or not at all!2) the clips are most times so brief and out of their originals' place that they just give a momentary shock to the viewer and, for those unfamiliar with these films, will make no sense at all (indeed, the moment where the shark jumps out of the water at roy scheider in "jaws" is shown much to the effect of a sight gag. whereas, in the original's context, it had power.)3) did we really need pleasance and allen in the audience reminding us that "it's only a movie" or that most of the violence in the horror movies "is, sadly, against women"? so, is that an indictment against the movie-makers for adding those scenes or the movie-goers who tromp into the theaters and watch the same kind of fodder time and again? sorry, that's a whole can of worms to open for a more deserving movie.4) and most importantly, why is the movie so short? it isn't like there wasn't enough of these kinds of movies to use. if they had just opened up their resources and used every available film, they could have had a "that's entertainment!"-style movie that would have been comparatively more entertaining. heck, even drag out christopher lee and peter cushing (cushing was alive then, mind you) and better yet, even vincent price would have been more than willing, i'll bet! what a cheer that would have gotten from the audience!but no... all we're left with is a dreary little flick that pretends to pay homage to these movies but all it does is leave the viewer feeling cheated out of less than 90 minutes with which they could have went and watched a real movie. don't get me wrong; it was good to see what clips they did show, but if they could have just done more with the goods!two stars. another good idea left laying "in the aisles".

pointless and pretty silly film that is just basically a compilation of clips from horror, science fiction and suspense films. there are unnecessary shots to an audience watching the clips and donald pleasance and nancy allen are among audience members who turn to the camera and explain why we love horror films. not a bad idea but all the explanations are obvious ("movie horror helps us deal with real horror", "you are at the mercy of the filmmaker in a theatre") and pretty trite. also the clips are shown very quickly and the changes are kind of jarring. and, shown out of context, these bits aren't very scary at all. and it's real short--i saw it in a theatre back in 1984 and was outraged that i paid $5.00 for an 84 minute movie!still, it is reasonably well-edited and allen and pleasance seem to be enjoying themselves. for people who have an interest in knowing more about terror this might be fun and interesting. but if you're a horror fan (like me) you'll probably be bored silly. good idea, bad execution (no pun intended). i give it a 3.

if this was nominated for a screenwriting award by the wga, a professional association of screenwriters, then it's time to hang up the word processor. astonishingly inept writing, direction, production, at every level, even for a tv movie. no cliche goes unexploited in this jaw-droppingly bad movie. what were they thinking? does anyone really believe kids are stupid enough to watch this?

maybe the target audience of this disney channel tv-movie will be pleased with it, but if any parents are watching along with the youngsters, they will clearly see that "cranked out" is written all over this production. obviously it was no one's dream to make this movie, but rather, this was concocted in a board room somewhere, then produced with cold efficiency. there is some talent among the cast, but actors like dabney coleman and jay thomas don't get much of a chance to showcase their talent. the impossibly cute elisabeth harnois is engaging as the first daughter, but will friedle is stuck once again playing another dumb character, though he's not nearly as moronic and annoying as in his "boy meets world" role. the background for this movie is washington, d.c. and the white house, but there is no real "presidential" feel to the film and the secret service is made out to be little better than the keystone kops when it come to doing their duty. the disney channel presents a lot of original tv-movies and most of them are better than this.

this movie isn't that great...at all but it's good when you want to just laugh, because it's pretty ridiculous :) there are a lot of mistakes in it and it's cheesy. i got this movie for christmas like 5 years ago but for some reason i've never given it away. i guess i just like it for a rainy day even though i only watch it like once a year. this is a very 90's movie so it's really funny to see how everyone dresses and acts. this movie is good for someone young...although come to think of it, i didn't even like it much when i was like 12 but that's just my personal opinion. the movie was really predictable. i wish it had had some extra weird twists but i guess it was trying to be an appropriate movie for everyone to enjoy. i think it was appropriate for the whole family but hallie's dress was a bit unmodest but certainly appropriate enough for family material.

five fingers is so bad, that i hardly know where to begin. so let me admit first, that i have only seen the first half hour. when the first finger had been chopped off, i thought sleeping a more useful activity. i told my girlfriend the meaning of "five fingers" and she immediately followed my example.couldn't the producer, the director and/or the scriptwriter consult a chess-amateur? like me? they should have used a digital chess-clock and not an analogue. this major goof makes the mental pressure put on martijn just a laugh. how, when and why did martijn date a moroccan girlfriend? such an affair is very rare in the netherlands.calling me a retard is of course an insult to all those people suffering with a much lower than average iq. moreover, as far as i know, retards don't play chess. i do.the biggest problem is the script of course. just compare the little intelligent movie hard candy. to keep the spectator in a grip, the information must be revealed bit by bit. a nice twist now and then also helps. i understood from other reviews, that there is a big one at the end of the movie. any smart person can guess what it is. this of course just raises more questions - why is the travel guide killed? oh my, why should i even care? the whole movie focuses on just one thing: the chopped fingers. the makers have not even learned hitchcock's lesson: it is thrilling to get a bomb exploded. it is more thrilling to show that bomb ticking. but no, we don't see the paper-cutter until the impossible countdown is over. i will not waste more words on this crap. go see hard candy.

boring movie. poor plot. poor actors. the movie happens in a room supposed to be in morocco but actually in some american city! the "arab terrorists" are the patriots the blonde patriot is the "arab terrorist"...damn!there is something good about this movie though (that's why the score is 2 out of 10). the director turns the ridiculous stereotype about terrorism the media feeds us every day into the real thing, the terrorists are americans (or western people if you like).the movie is divided into two parts. the first part of the movie concerns the dutchman travel (15 seconds) while the second part is about the staying in the amazing dark brown room (1 hour and something).the dutch guy is going to deliver money in morocco to some "charity organization", gets off the plain, takes the bus and ends up kidnapped in a dark brown room. he is kidnapped with another guy that is shot after telling "they will not shoot at us". the dutch survivor is forced to play chess with a morpheus-like arab guy for so long that you'll learn how to play chess too! at the end the dutch guy reveals his plot not because they cut four of his fingers off but because he is tricked by such a lame game you should watch the movie for!good when you are so tired you can't sleep.

i lasted almost ninety minutes through this dreadful movie waiting for some revelation about dance or spirit or inspiration or something and gave up! what possessed the filmmakers to do this? this is an old woman of limited talent who is obsessed with herself and nothing else. to fill in a story without a point we get some stuff about the other folks in her thrall, her aid to burros, and, of course, her ten cats! do not see this film. and have nothing more to do with anybody who loved it - they do not have a clue. there are fascinating people in this world with wonderful stories to tell and insights to share - but marta becket is not one of them. the people i took to this movie say they have forgiven me - but that they will never, ever stop kidding me about it.

"i remember waiting to be born..." "vision quest that was the american west." "we went to a psychic..." "i'm sure their first reaction is that she's cuckoo" "...the place is haunted..." "i think there's another dimension right here." an artist (marta becket) and her husband many decades ago left the hustle and bustle and culture of new york and moved to a god-forsaken town with a population of 10 in death valley. there, they renovated a theater--painting it is a very home-spun/folk art manner. and, once finished, she bega putting on dancing performances for practically no one. in many ways, it's highly reminiscent of the werner herzog film fitzcarraldo or field of dreams--though amargosa is a documentary of a real person--not a mythical crazy man like klaus kinski or kevin costner. her husband eventually leaves--much of it apparently because of the lifestyle she chose. so, today she lives on with her ten cats and a sanctuary for burros eventually along with her new male companion, tom.what you think about this documentary depends on your perspectives. if you are into new age ideas and open to these sensibilities, then you'll more likely appreciate the film. her talking about how she remembers her birth, ghosts, vision quests and psychics frankly made the psychology teacher in me cringe and this would definitely be the case for many people. in addition, her burro sanctuary and trying to preserve horses in the desert will most likely appeal to peta and many other animal lovers, though with my background in environmental concerns and biology, i see the burros and horses as a blight that would destroy the native plants and animals. so on two different accounts, i tend to think quite the opposite of marta--who is more of a "feeler" and "sensing" individual. depending on how you feel about all this will definitely color your opinions--and i am pretty sure most people will either think she's a genius or a nut! you'll just have to guess what i think.now despite all this, the film is interesting and marta's life is definitely not dull--particularly since in recent years, people have actually begun taking trips to the desert to see her perform. there is a definite following for her and her unusual little world. while i would not be nearly as positive as most reviews, i also can't be as negative as the one review, as there is definite merit to this odd documentary. i like films about unusual people and marta certainly is unusual! i also appreciate her love of her art and happy life--that is a rare gift. i teach psychology at an arts school and it sure would be interesting to show this to the staff--where i am pretty sure we'd get a strong positive and negative reaction to the film--probably depending on whether the teachers taught the arts classes or core curriculum! it sure would be interesting.by the way, and i am not trying to be sarcastic, but when marta's husband was having affairs, with whom did this occur?! after all, they lived in the middle of no where and i was left wondering where he'd find partners.by the way, if you'd like to see her perform and/or stay at her hotel, it can be found at www.amargosaoperahouse.com/ . the site is in english, french and german and hotel rates are pretty reasonable as are ticket prices.

the satirical movie website dateline hollywood joked that "son of the mask" was all a practical joke star jamie kennedy played on new line cinema for his show "the jamie kennedy experiment." if only. and if only the movie had been half as funny as that satire piece."the mask" was the ideal vehicle for the face-pulling jim carrey that so many viewers dote on; it also delighted males over the age of 12 by introducing cameron diaz. so having a followup minus both of them was not a good idea, plus you'd have thought new line would have learned their lesson after "dumb and dumberer: when harry met lloyd." but no... though to be fair, having an all new cast is in keeping with the original comic (in which the mask went from owner to owner). as written by lance khazei and directed by lawrence guterman, however, there's nothing there in return, except a steady stream of admittedly decent fx by the usual squadron of houses (industrial light and magic improving on the "ally mcbeal" dancing baby and their own "baby's day out," with the tippett studio, giant killer robots, digital dimension and so on in support) and an even greater pandering to cartoon fans by having our hero work at an animation company (responsible for such gems as "siamese popes"), naming his character after tex avery, and working in not just references to classic cartoons but actual clips.the trouble is that last approach doesn't really work, partly because most of the attempts to bring cartoon trappings to live action fall flat (especially the cars getting in the party mood) and mostly because the tributes to the flintstones, woody woodpecker, "duck amuck" and especially "one froggy evening" show up how weak this movie is in comparison. plus the movie fits in shambolic slapstick alongside strained sentiment (the underlying theme of the story is family; our hero isn't ready to have a son, and his nemesis - alan cumming as the norse god loki - is far from the apple of odin's eye... and what bob hoskins is doing here as odin, even after "super mario bros.," is beyond me), and kennedy just isn't in the same league as carrey in the zany stakes - though it's not like he gets any help from the script. also note that unlike diaz, the very cute traylor howard (as the mother of the son of the mask) doesn't get much to do; giving her the mask might have helped the movie.further points are lost for throwing away cumming, hoskins, steven wright and magda szubanski; for a suspiciously abbreviated running time (which would account for some gaping plot holes and scenes that seem to be missing); and for an incredibly bad attempt at an inside joke when our hero fails to sell the concept of the "green guy" as an animated tv series - "the mask" did become an animated tv series in real life, and was a far better follow up than this sequel. the fact that this actually opened in britain before the us should tell you everything... what with this and "blade: trinity," new line seems intent on cornering the market on dreadful sequels with cast members from "two guys and a girl." what next, "the butterfly effect 2" with nathan fillion?somebody stop this.

this "film," and i use that term loosely, reminds me of the first joke my daughter wrote, at eighteen months: "p.u., stinky poopies!" like that joke, this movie can only appeal to the very young, the very immature, or the very stupid. that said, there are a few bright spots. the effects, where the majority of the reputed $100 million went, are kinetic and convincing -- i mean, as convincing as those kind of kinetic cgi effects can be. the cgi baby effects are not great, but i imagine those are very hard to do well... although for a hundred-million bucks, they could have been better!moose, the dog from "frasier," phoned in his usual exemplary performance. steven wright did well with a small part. alan cummings was, well, alan cummings-as-villain, which we've seen before, and bob hoskins as odin was unrecognizable, but enjoyable. the actress playing mrs. avery was cute-as-a-button, as you'd expect, and jamie kennedy stunk, as you'd expect. his best role so far was in the scream trilogy (not to be confused with the lord of the rings trilogy), and in three kings. he should stick, perhaps, to more subtle forms of comedy. jim carrey, he ain't.the writing and direction were, if anything, worse than kennedy's performance. i semi-remember one clever (though seven-year-old clever) line that i wish someone would quote accurately for the "memorable quotes" section. something about avery's proposed costume being the "crappiest crap in craptown," it was a second-grade joke, but sort of funny in context.over all, since there's nothing lower than a "one," i give this film a "one."

i give this movie 2 stars purely because of its slightly liberal plot line. without going into too much detail.the acting in this movie is terrible. really terrible - wooden, shallow.the graffiti on show is weak, so bloody weak that i can only wonder why they bothered to use graffiti artists at all. it was obvious in the spraying scenes that they'd gotten other people in to do the 'work'. they might as well have let the actors do the painting and saved themselves a few cents.i would avoid this film at all costs.the kid loco soundtrack used to be something i listened to on my ipod, its going to be a while before i can go back there for fear of this movie coming back into my mind.avoid at all costs. unless you are thinking to yourself "wow, its been a while since i've seen a really sh*t movie...."

i enjoy gay-themed movies where the characters aren't stereotypically gay and that's what attracted me to this movie, that and the principal actor, which is the only reason i'm giving this movie one more star than it deserves (although not because of his acting in the film, let me tell you). a lot of people complain about the cinematography, but the camcorder feel of the movie added a certain "underground" quality to it for me and there are a couple of scenes, usually around sunset or sunrise and among trains that would make any movie screen blush.but the acting is cardboard, the music is repetitive (i got through the latter half of the movie listening to a soundtrack from another film), you have to wait almost twenty minutes for any dialog and then it is awkward and amateur. the subject of graffiti could have made this movie great had it been gracefully exploited and had the art itself been more intriguing, but it isn't.worst of all, there is no climax; there wasn't really a plot to begin with. the movie just crawls back into its shell of silence and dies. a forgettable movie.

i'm sorry but i can't agree that this was a good movie. yes, it looked good visually, but it's the story that drives the movie and i must say the story sucked big-time. how in the world did they manage to slip some of those plot-holes past the critics. better story and i would've gave it a higher vote but i was impossible to do that and still be able to live with myself. i have always been a fan of scary movies, and the previews really had me fooled. all the scary scenes were shown in the previews. and why did the family that got killed stay to haunt the house? why did the father come back again? why did he decide to kill in the first place? why were the kids the only ones to see the ghosts first? to many questions, not enough answers. if i could've gave it a zero, i would've.

i almost laughed out loud when during the commentary the director said this movie is original with a strong plot line. there is not one... repeat one original plot line or special effect in this blah movie. the crows.... hitchcock did it superbly back before cgi and even with cgi this film falls short of a well done attack scene. the creepy crawly boy... the grudge did it and did it better. the psycho...done in cold creek manor most recently, however it has been done to death. no pun intended. disconnected/rebellious teen who no one listens to... about a dozen films have used this one right down to beetlejuice. the oozy stuff from the basement... can you say amnityville horror? doors opening unbidden... what lies beneath did it with much more flair. creepy farmhouse... too numerous to mention. the backdrop of metaphysics-- which should have been the central focus, gets lost once you figure out what is happening, which by the way is pretty early on.one thing (of many actually) they never even try to explain in the movie is how they explain to the police that their attacker was sucked down the ooze in the basement, so they really don't have a body. overall... don't bother

this movie was trying to something, but failed miserably. all the attempts at suspense were cheap, and there were so many tired gimmicks and plot holes i ended up laughing and making fun of it the whole way through. at least i was entertained. the ghosts are attempting to warn the family, so why do they attack the girl, whose name i didn't care to remember. and what was with the black and white at the beginning? i know what they were trying to do, but they fell far short. and where the heck did that guy (john corbett's character) come from? he just waltzes in from no where in a vast field. and why did he suddenly lose it again when the ravens came? and if the ravens were a manifestation of the spirits of his family, then why did they attack him if it would make him try to kill the family? makes no sense. so many things in this movie just don't make sense, and the acting ain't too pretty on the part of the main girl character. it's not terrible, just a little like her kiddy movie days. so all in all this movie wasn't brilliant, but i had a good time ripping at it, and sometimes that's all a horror movie needs to do. rent for entertainment not quality.

directors of "the messengers" danny pang and oxide pang are responsible for "the eye" and its sequel and their premiere american picture plays like "the grudge"-lite set in a farmhouse.a family of four move from chicago to a run-down sunflower farm in rural north dakota.almost immediately their teenage daughter jess starts seeing ghosts.of course her parents and the police are skeptical.admittedly the film is well-made and there are two or three effective scares,but relies too much on 'boo' effect.still the plot is a carbon copy of many ghost stories and the ending is anti-climatic and stupefyingly awful.scares are on the low side too with a tendency toward cgi.overall,"the messengers" is a pretty weak horror film that simply doesn't deliver.4 out of 10.

despite a totally misleading advertising campaign, this flick turns out to be an irritatingly clichéd, sub-par haunted house flick with a totally implausible ending. clue #1 for all considering seeing this turkey: sam raimi didn't direct it. although commercials for the movie play up his involvement, in truth he is one of four producers. it's too bad that someone as talented as raimi has allowed his name to be used in conjunction with such a poor movie. i don't think he would ever have directed something like this; that task was left to the pang brothers.the screenplay for this film seems to have been cobbled together from numerous other "horror" films, so you'll find absolutely zero original content in "the messengers." what we get are a scene here and there that was plucked straight out of "pulse," a couple that could have come from "the birds," one or two from "the others," etc. nearly every scene, almost every line of dialogue, is one that has been lifted from any number of other movies. the whole thing makes for such a predictable movie that almost anyone will be able to figure out the "surprise ending" long before it comes.right about here would be a good time to point out that the advertising campaign, centered on the idea that only children can see ghosts, has nothing to do with this movie. in fact, everyone can see the ghosts. the teenage daughter and mother characters certainly see them, even quite early in the movie. i'm sure that whomever was in charge of marketing came up with this campaign because the film needed a unique angle to have any box office appeal, which otherwise is entirely absent. now you know, so don't be fooled! perhaps what this movie lacks most of all is anything resembling chemistry between the actors. it simply isn't there. all of the interactions come across as awkwardly stilted. coupled with the hackneyed story and ridiculous plot holes (just what is a guy who murdered his whole family doing still lurking around the small town where the murder happened, anyhow? didn't anyone think to maybe arrest him?), it all adds up to a profoundly unsatisfying ghost flick that only manages to surprise anyone over the age of ten with cheap shots: loud noises, visual flashes, and anything short of a sheeted figure jumping out of a closet and yelling "boo!" all we get for our buck this time around is yet another poorly-made film about spirits attempting to warn people away from a house. if there's any message that "the messengers" delivers, it's "don't waste your time on this movie."

this movie has all the ingredients of a great horror story and loses it in the last half. few movies can actually give me chill bumps. this one did. few horror movie give me a sense of dread. this one did. it kept me guessing. i cared about the story. i cared about the characters. the acting was decent. unfortunately, about half way through the movie, the story just doesn't have many good directions it can go. it becomes evident that everything cool about the plot is going to self-destruct. it does. what builds in the first half as a great horror concept shifts away from horror and towards the absurd. a plausible fear turns into a series of implausible reactions from the characters. the story concludes with disappointment. while this movie seems complete, there is one loose end that could setup for a sequel. the movie isn't good enough for a sequel. this movie is worth seeing in the theater, just don't expect to be stunned. this is best suited as a movie to rent. it's probably not a movie you'd want to own.

well, first of all, excuse me for the lame pun in the title. i was browsing for movies to rent the other day and saw this. i heard something about this so i picked it up and looked on the back and there was a short little review blurb on it from john fallon aka arrow in the head! at that moment i thought "well if he likes it then i gotta like it!" so i rented it and just finally got around to watching it last night (college keeps me so busy). oh and i might wanna add that i read a little of arrow's review and it turns out that out of 4 stars he gave it 1 and a half. so my expectations from this movie went from very high to iffy. well after watching this, i once again agree with arrow (and turns out that quote from the review was the only positive thing he said about that!) wow, did this film stink or what? where do i begin with why it did so? well, the film was so dull in my opinion. not even the cool gore bits excited me and when a decapitation doesn't excite you in a movie, that's bad! the characters i hated a lot and from the beginning i could tell who would die and who wouldn't. actually the film proved me wrong at some points, but the worst thing is that one particular character i wanted to die didn't! what the heck? and the chemistry between the main girl and the guy she met? didn't feel it. he obviously was just there to be eye candy and give her a love interest, otherwise i thought he was a waste! and as a horror fan i should know that doing the "dumb horror movie" sometimes gotta happen or else there wouldn't be much of a movie, but the ones in here ticked me off! hello? why are you making out in the room of the killer nun when you should be on the lookout from her? and it was done by the supposedly smarter characters no less. the twist....ah, it would have been alright, if it hadn't been done a billion times and i didn't have to sit through this wast of film to reach that point! my main point: stupid movie that sucked me in with some words of my favorite (actually my only favorite) movie critic. jerks!

the only good thing of this movie is its final twist. in 97 minutes of film we can only save one single idea, which was totally wasted in this movie i must say! for more than 90 minutes this film is just a collection of clichés, bad acting, stupid ideas and disclosures, complete lack of suspense, stupid deaths, terrible special effects; all this in a pathetic and unoriginal plot until the last three minutes, where, finally, a good idea appeared! it's nothing outstanding or an extremely original idea, but, at least was a "decent" good idea, the only one the entire movie has! i won't spoil it, but i must say i think that idea with a better plot, better fx and, definitely, a better acting, would turn into a good film. if you watch this movie and can stand it until the end you will know what it is

the movie is nothing extraordinary. as a matter of fact, it is an insult to the horror genre. nothing about it borders on scary... not even close to the threshold of scary...it's just another case of "another teenage horror movie"-seen one and you've seen em all. first few minutes in the movie and you'll know what will happen next. the worst part is, the script is blunter than the most recent installment of scary movie. would have been better if it's written in spanish. and don't get me started with the inside jokes and punchlines.though i will give a little credit for the special effects. but trust me, like any other hollywood made horror movie, cgi's and special effects has little or no effect to a horror movie's ability to scare. in fact, it makes it worse.between the fresh faced anita briem and the spooky location, there's not much to see in this movie.

i am a huge horror fan, particularly spanish horror. this film had so many possibilities to be good. it's a marvelous idea, a vigilante ghost nun, as most of what has come out of jaume balangueró's mind. both visual and sound effects were also pretty good. but everything was shamefully spoiled by bad direction, awful casting and a painfully bad (exposition, exposition!) script. too bad. maybe balangueró should write and direct himself a remake...moreover, i don't really understand why this had to be spoken in english by actors who can't really speak english (and when they do, they do it so bad it just makes their performances even more fake). if you look at contemporary spanish horror films like el orfanato or rec, the performances are totally in tune with this type of stylish ghost story - and that is being realistic, being believable as someone like ourselves, like real people, because that is the only way horror achieves it's goal. unfortunately, everything failed in la monja.

i didn't buy this, i didn't rent this, it was on ppv and someone burned a copy of it and loaned it to me, so at least i wasted no money on it. for someone that did darkness, the nameless, devil's backbone, this is a pretty lame film. seems to have something to do with a bunch of girls that were at a convent back in the day and now they're all grown up and they're being pursued and killed one by one by a nun that comes out of the kitchen sink, the toilet, and even manages to negotiate the revolving doors in a hotel. and what makes this nun so mean and nasty (and wet?) i dunno, this was so boring that at some point about halfway through i just stopped it, put it away, and watched something else. wasn't even interested in finding out, really. oh sure, there's some lovely young ladies to look at but hey, are two of them lesbians? i guess, there's a picture on the bedside table of one young lady's bedroom and what self-respecting horror movie wouldn't be complete these days without a lesbian couple? yeah whatever. 2 out of 10, if you want to see a worthwhile nun horror movie try "desecration", "dead waters", or "the convent" (and that's the one with adrienne barbeau, by the way, not the one with john malkovich).

the headline describes it exactly. this dribble of a film was nothing more than the typical 'group of teens killed someone accidentally now that someone is haunting/killing them off 20 years later' crap that has been shoved down our throats for decades. the only twist is instead of an angry ex-classmate or lovable psycho/loser, it was a nun. nun wants to eliminate the sin from the girls, blah blah, girls accidentally/purposely drown the nun, blah blah, nun haunts the girls, people die, movie ends. the only thing that made this watchable were the death scenes, which were pretty cool (especially the one with the elevator door ripping off this fat lady's arms) but even they couldn't make this a great movie. brian yuzna should hang his head for attaching himself to this refuse. i'm sure glad i rented it and didn't buy it, or i'd be furious beyond belief. if you want a nunsploitation flick to please the senses, go watch demonia or something. stay away from this garbage.

review: nunsploitation films. they've been around since forever. a few that pop to mind are the mexican devil worshiping movie alucarda, night of the demons 2, the convent and of course dante tomasellis desecration. cant blame somebody for trying to exploit a religious/holy image and twisting it around to make it scary. if done right, it works. here comes the most recent addition to the nunsploitation sub-genre simply titled the nun.the story is about this group of girls that live in a catholic school. in this school there's a nun who is particularly cruel to one of the girls. the girls acting in self defense against the abusive nun accidentally kill her and then decide to bury her and tell no one. fast forward 18 years later and the nun is back searching for revenge from those who killed her.this movie was produced by brian yuznas fantastic factory. you know, the company that makes horror movies in spain. need a reminder of the kind of movies that this company churns out? well heres a small reminder: arachnid, darkness, romasanta: the werewolf hunt, rottweiler. you get the picture. about the only really good movie that this company has produced (in my opinion) was stuart gordons dagon. thats it. oh no, wait, i believe they also produced the excellent christian bale vehicle the machinist. but thats it. so when i consciously rented this movie, i knew i wasn't going to watch anything that was mind blowingly good. still, with all that mental preparation i was disappointed.one of the only good things this movie has going for it is its slick look. the movie has some nice cinematography. it doesn't look like a cheap horror film. the movies special effects were alright, with the nun being able to travel through water. well, that was an image that lended it self for some cool fx moments that sometimes scratched into cheesy territory but sometimes were cool enough to watch. i dug that scene with the nun hurling herself at people like a bucket of water. its not a particularly deadly move, but it made for a cool visual. there's some gore here but not a lot of it. one particular scene involving an elevator death was cool, but sadly the movie hit its peak with that scene. and it was only half way through. after that, nothing really cool happens and the movie deludes into an incredible borefest.the movie just turns into the nun popping up every now and then to give us a boo scare, she would kill someone and then cut! we get back to the characters talking crap, going through rooms, opening doors, you get the drill. and i just personally hate it when a horror movie turns into that. people opening doors and going into rooms. boring! and when the characters do talk its terrible dialog. in one particularly stupid scene a character decides right out of the blue that the nun turns into flesh and blood whenever she is in the water so thats they way to go to try and kill her. and everyone just says ok! and they all elaborate this plan to kill the nun in a water tank. now, who gave that guy this info and why did the others just take it for granted? who the hell knows, but its scenes like that that make the movie look stupid.and yet another thing that got in the way of my enjoyment of this film was the fact that they used spanish actors who have a very thick accent. when they try to speak english its very hard to make out what the hell they are trying to say. id prefer to have them be dubbed then try and figure out what they are saying and become frustrated. the fact that this dvd has no english subtitles didn't help matters either.so in conclusion, this is a movie that has some slick visuals, nice sound effects but a terrible terrible script. i guess this just goes to show that you might have the biggest budget or the best special effects, but if your movie has a bad script with terrible characters and situations that your audience cant connect with, then you've still got a bad movie. such was the case with the nun.if you want to have some real fun with evil nuns, rent any of the films i mentioned at the beginning of this review. now, as for the makers of this film, they should go say ten hail maries and light fifty candles to their saint of choice to see if they'll be forgiven for making this sinfully terrible film.rating: 2 out of 5.

six students at a convent do the unthinkable - kill a nun who was overbearing. now, eighteen years later, the nun's spirit is back and getting revenge for her murder.yea, basically that's the short of it. there's more to it than that, but i still have no clue what it is. the only really cool thing is the effects on the spiritual nun, as i was pretty impressed for being a more low-budget flick. i'm also confused as to whether or not it's in english. most of the actors are italian, and even the title here is in italian, yet they spoke english in the film (i think, or it might've been dubbed, i still can't tell).anyway, the real premise of the film is pretty idiotic, and the ending not only doesn't make sense, it...well...doesn't make sense.

i thought this movie'd be totally different than just another teen-slasher. well i was totally wrong. there's a liquid nun coming out of the toilet seat and something really odd. i know that spanish culture is a bit different and their movies too, but i didn't expect to see a fake hollywood film. they certainly faked it pretty well though. why'd they make a movie without any new aspects? this is just plain boring and it'd been done totally without any imagination.i thought that having a nun as the bad guy in the movie'd be something really original. it turned out to be a teen slasher. if this'd been done ten years ago then it'd have been something new.i can't recommend this movie for anyone but it certainly has some comedy value! it's like a horror parody in some points.

the major flaw in this spanish slasher/shocker is within it's script. for the first half hour it's an okay effort, building some suspense and an atmosphere of fear and dread. we even get some nice killings too! then it goes completely downhill and turns into a whole catalog of "your basic slasher clichés". i must admit that i was quite disappointed because the trailer promised so much more. the final thirty minutes consists of some killings and a lot of running around in an abandoned convent. it should have been so much better (although the final scenes in the flooded room is quite okay)!first of all, we have the dialog. it's awful most of the time (there was quite a few giggles in the audience here and there when i saw it) and merely adequate elsewhere. it is also barely audible during a lot of scenes, drowning under the pressure of sound effects and the soundtrack (however that might not be such a bad thing after all considering the stupid lines we have to listen to!). there is one line in the whole movie that makes a reference to the "i know what you did last summer"-movies, indicating that the film makers wrote it all as one big joke, but i doubt it.and the ending...well, some will hate it, others will dig it. for me, it was mostly a question of the former because the final twist comes from out of nowhere! if the audience had been given some clues to the girls mental status, i might have thought otherwise. it also throws all logic out of the window, because the murderer could never had been in place for some of the kills! but as an avid horror fan i have learned to live with these inconsistencies in spanish and italian movies.but all is not bad. the movie has a big budget appearance, mainly due to the excellent cinematography (the scenes from past times really shines here), tight editing and an atmospheric soundtrack. even though most of the actors are pretty bad, anita briem is an exception, making the most of what she has to work with. real screen presence!and, like i mentioned before, the killings are gory enough for the fans of such stuff and they are usually accompanied by very good special effects involving images of water (but the "water theme" tends to get tiresome in the end though).so, to end this review, it's a movie that is quite fun in a "so-bad-it's-good" kind of way and it's also pleasing to the eye. but don't expect too much because it doesn't deliver as you probably think it will, judging from trailer and plot descriptions.

an in-name-only sequel to john carpenter's vampires, this movie takes place in thailand and involves a sect of bad vampires, who enjoy killing people, and a sect of good vampires who do not. while it's an interesting idea to set a vampire film in thailand, the writers don't seem to do a lot with the exotic locale. this film could just as easily have been set in los angeles. which brings me to my next point, which is that this seems a lot like blade lite. we've got the rock soundtrack, the martial art battle scenes, a dance club bloodletting and, of course, lots of sharp objects going through vampires. what we don't have is the budget and talent. yes, the hero is a good martial arts fighter, too bad his acting wasn't as good, and there's plenty of decent wire work, and tons of revved up fight sequences, maybe too many. the problem is they just don't have the same impact as the ones in any of the blade films. perhaps it's just that the film has a "been there seen that" feel to it.however, for me the biggest problem was that the filmmakers didn't take enough time to establish the relationship between the lead, played by the buff and bland colin egglesfield, and his girlfriend. she gets snatched at the very beginning of the flick after a whiny exchange with her boyfriend. we have no vested interest in her welfare at this point and no reason to believe that her boyfriend would be willing to risk his neck to save her. now that's a major drawback when that's the major thrust of the plot.in the end, you could do worse than waste 85 minutes of your time with this, but i can think of a lot better things to do with your time, like renting any of the blade movies.

there's a good story well hidden and never really used! the film is short and overly dependent on action and thematic photography; somehow, character and story development have been forgotten. what is left is muddled and superficial.turn off your brain and watchyou will probably find that the time goes quickly enough, but unless you are the sort of person that finds soaps deep and meaningful, you are going to get no real satisfaction from this film.watch only if you have nothing better to do and then only if someone else pays for the video rental.

this movie "vampires: the turning" isn't even really worth the 2 out of 10 i'm giving it. the movie, is very predictable from beginning, up to the very end when our hero kills the leader of the vampire slayers. the use of music in this movie was even bad, it kept playing as if you were to expect something significant to happen at any second, though it never did. the acting, was b-rank at best... and the movie was just, dull. the only reason i give this movie a 2 out of 10 is because the story, had potential though it ended up unable to deliver. oh, and did i mention the wardrobe? the wardrobe for this movie was obviously cheap to "non-existent" because our hero, and his girlfriend (whom he's trying to save throughout the entire movie) wear the same outfits through the entire movie. i'd suggest this film only if your really bored, and don't have a good wall with fresh paint to watch dry. ~dave, the horror cowboy

even though this was set up to be a showcase for some kickboxing and swordplay, "vampires: the turning" (vtt) could have aspired beyond that. because it doesn't even aspire to be a good vampire movie, vtt fails to deliver any punch that it may have been attempting to.using the idea of an 800-year-old thai vampire was interesting, but the story about progeny she mistakenly brought into existence (and now must wipe out) actually reminds me of gizmo and his plight in "gremlins," and that isn't a good thing when it come to a vampire flick.stephanie chao is attractive and serves as the "good" vampire very well, but her lack of any accent grates when you realize that she's an 800-year-old vampire. added to that, when she tells connor he's "a young soul," she doesn't deliver the line with much of the weight you would expect from an "old" soul. attractive, but not believable.meredith monroe was more believable in her role but, for a "dawson's creek" alum, you would think she would have more screen time. the question of whether amanda succumbs and "turns" is the most compelling reason to continue watching this movie, and you never get it. you get a tease of it, but you never actually get any type of development out of the characters for that plot device. it's a cheap way to play your audience, folks.if you want something that is a good vampire movie, go find lugosi's "dracula," and if you want a sexy vampire movie, you have dozens of flicks from hammer with a lot more strength than this one. in the end, if you want good or sexy, this isn't the place. this is just forgettable.

in thailand, the americans connor (colin egglesfield) and his girlfriend amanda (meredith monroe) quarrel in a muay-thai fight, and amanda leaves connor alone. she asks the direction of the hotel to a stranger, indeed the mean vampire niran (don hetrakul), and she is bitten and kidnapped by his gang of evil vampires in motorcycles. connor joins to a clan of "good" vampires leaded by sang (stephanie chao), trying to save amanda from the claws of niran.i expected that "vampires: the turning" were a good movie. the locations and the cinematography are beautiful; the very heavy music score is excellent; stephanie chao is gorgeous and attractive; but unfortunately, the screenplay and the director are terrible and the very loose costume of meredith monroe does not help her fallen breasts. the story is very short, and the unknown marty weiss uses long scenes with motorcycle race, fights and boring flashbacks to complete a minimum running time for film. my vote is four.title (brazil): "vampiros: a conversão" ("vampires: the conversion")

this film with fine production values features secrets and how friends use each other. henry may long is a very well-acted, dimly lit, depressing turn-of-the-century period piece about a friendship between a fatally ill man and a melancholy, indebted junkie. talky drawing room dramas are not my cup of tea, and all the crying wears thin. recommended if you like independent, slyly intellectual, slow-paced merchant ivory-type features. i suspected that the main characters were in love, but their connection was so intimated, it didn't really have the emotional impact of 'brokeback mountain.' it features some good writing with a scene discussing how to disappear in life, but it is truly a dark and depressing film.

a very, very, very slow-moving, aimless movie about a distressed, drifting young man. not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience, nearly half of whom walked out. attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles, the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent. very little music or anything to speak of. the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head. he goes to a used record store to buy it for his lover and has to sing the song for two sales clerks before they find the album. cute scene gave promise, but it went downhill from there. the rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning... if it's about emptiness, it works i guess because it's empty. wasted two hours.

a terrible deception: controversial film, winner of the teddy in berlin 2003, mil nubes de paz turned out to be a fiasco. the actors are all reciting (well, they are not exactly actors); the film tried to be a high bet but ends up being a doubtful bet: it stays in the superficiality of two guys kissing and a guy whose lover is gone; it has no purpose: nothing to do with the homo-sexuality presented in other films (e.g. before night falls (2000) by julian schnabel). technically the only thing that works is the photography; otherwise, the camera is put in strange angles (to make it more `art-film') and the whole film runs in a black and white atmosphere. the film is so pretentious that bothers. i mean, it's good to be pretentious when you have talent to support it. or maybe it is that it's so art-cinema that it's incomprehensible. the story flows slowly, slowly, slowly. to me, more form than essence. superb edition? it was good. superb direction? don't think so: the film is weak. it was an interesting project. it's a shame. it's a flaw. one star out of four.

it's astonishing that some people saw this as art. we saw it as a poorly filmed (shaky hand-held camera and all), (generally) badly acted, unscripted mess that seemed more like a high school film project with the kids experimenting in black & white film making. injecting mounds of poetry in place of a story does not an art film make. when we watched this in the theatre, people were starting to have fits of the giggles (us included) at the endless stupidity of this self-indulgent, meandering mess. and believe me, it does seem endless. had we finished our candy and popcorn, we too would have walked out of the theatre with the other two dozen people who packed up and left looking for something more interesting to do!

but even caricatures need a plausible plot line. i suppose in 1934 some part of that audience long ago would enjoy this tepid farce. it doesn't age well. it does give nat pendelton and zasu pitts experienced and expert support players a shot at leading roles. pendelton, who is featured prominently in the thin man series tries his best but is over matched by witless plot. with the backdrop being a stage play with gangsters its not exactly original material. movie's saving grace is the always excellent edward everett horton in a wasted performance. but don't waste your time watching everett in this film. i would encourage anyone to watch him in his effort in holiday, with cary grant and katherine hepburn. same era 1936, but much better script and storyline. better gags and needless to say star power as well.

surely one of the lamest shows ever to be produced on these shores and thats saying something. even many of the lead actors didn't stick around for the duration. the fact that it ran for eight years is a sad indictment on the average intelligence and cultural nous of the aussie viewer. it went round and round in circles, with repetitive gags and poorly-drawn characters. arthur macarthur, for god's sake. did they actually pay the writers of this show? i wonder if anyone checked their qualifications. there were tired gags about rural people and second-rate farce situations that were poor imitations of a thousand english and us sitcoms that had gone before. i think that's what i hate about it so much, that it appears no one involved wanted to make it memorable, original or clever, instead opting for the lowest common denominator each time.

while the david lynch version of dune is choppy, awkward, and unfaithful to the novel, it is visually well designed and well acted. the best one can say about the sci fi channel's attempt to make dune into a miniseries is that it's ambitious. actually, that is virtually the only positive praise one can offer. the actors (with few exceptions) seem happy to recite their lines with the least emotion possible, and the least appropriate accents. the costumes seem to have been designed by someone with a a large surplus of mylar fabric on hand and an unhealthy love of unflattering headwear.in part, this miniseries suffers from living in the shadow of lynch's already well known effort. however, it takes elements from lynch's film which were not present in the novel and copies them nearly wholesale (i.e. the guild steersman's navigation sequence), and this only encourages encourages negative comparison to lynch's film. a for effort. d for virtually everything else.

if you have never read the classic science fiction novel this mini-series is based on, it may actually be good. unfortunately, if you are a fan of the book, you probably won't be able to watch more than the first hour or two. all of the political intrigue has been taken out of the film, the most important scenes from the book have been taken out, characters motivations have been changed completely, and words from the wrong characters mouths. where in the novel paul atredies was a teen age boy with incredible political skill and a great understanding of the way the world worked, in this film he is hot headed and and frustrated. avoid this movie at all costs.

this is a total piece of crap. it is an insult to the awesome book by frank herbert. they have mangled the story and characters. the acting is average to bad. the only character done right and played well is duke leto, played by william hurt. unfortunately, he dies pretty early in the story and then its all downhill from there (not that its a very tall hill to begin with).the 1984 movie was directed by the legendary david lynch. i was not overly impressed with the movie, but considering the technological limitations of the time, they tried their best. amazingly, the crappy mini series makes it look so much better by comparison. it was at least somewhat true to the book, which i really love. they had the chance to do it right this time, sadly it was not taken.

the dune miniseries opens with a "flashforward" montage of action sequences. the realisation quickly dawns that these are the *best* scenes out of the 265 minute running time, and they're not good. not good at all. oh dear. but let us not judge a book by its cover (even though that's exactly what we're being invited to do). let's give dune a chance to redeem itself.well, here's the expected watery opening on caladan. but who's this petulant, strangely ugly man? paul atreides? *this* is paul atreides? this generic plastic puppet? and why does he look so old? what's that? the actor's only 25? well, he doesn't *look* it, and that's way too old anyway.but at least he has charisma, right? wrong. alec newman is a stumbling, mumbling buffoon. i'm picturing him being discovered sitting in the dark in a remedial acting class because nobody liked him enough to tell him the class was over, and he's just too dumb to realise it. when your paul atreides has all the screen prescence of soggy toast, and an acting range from "petulant" to "blank" your production of dune is doomed from the start.the other actors take pity on poor alec though, and give uniformly insipid and incomprehensible performances so that he doesn't look too bad by comparison. at least, i *assume* that is what they are doing. because i'm charitable, you see.to be fair, they are clearly being given no direction at all. random gestures, blank or inconsistent deliveries, missing their marks, it's all here. this is like a master class in how not to do it.and sure, there are more elements of the book in this miniseries than there are in the 1984 movie, but there aren't twice as many, because of all the. pauses. to fill. time.but we can forgive all this because of the small budget of $20 million, or only $5 million per hour. nobody could be expected make quality science fiction on that sort of budget.except perhaps "stargate sg-1" which makes do with $1.4 million per 50 minute episode, or "farscape" at $2 million. and frankly i'd rather watch four episodes of either of those while being punched in the kidneys, than have to sit though the travesty that is dune the miniseries again.

what can i say? after having read herbert's books and loving lynch's movie version, i was extremely disappointed. i felt i was watching a reject version of buck rogers. the sets looked like left overs from a star wars tv special! i felt the acting was a bit amateurish by most. the costumes were garish and over done which gave it a '60s flash gordon, pulp feel. the worms! they're supposed to be sand worms and yet they appeared to "big stalagtites" with a mouth at the blunt end. the effects in general were pretty second rate. i won't even start about the disgraceful "navigator" effect.this so-called "frank herbert's dune" wasn't even faithfull to his books! it should have been called "frank herbert's dune - for dummies". key plot elements were left out, names were changed and the entire "feel" of the story was "sanitised". i didn't even recognise the harkonnens! in fact most of the characters appeared nothing like herbert's descriptions had depicted them. i'm starting to get upset just remembering what a tragedy it was. i'm glad i couldn't stomach the second installment....

drivel. utter junk. the writers must not have read the book, or seen david lynch's film. not worth wasting your time.longer does not make better. while more in-depth then lynch's film, it has gross in-accuracies, and down-play's key parts of the story."a night at the roxbury" is more worth your time.

this is the "battlefield earth" of mini series. it has with a few exceptions, all the disastrous ingredients that doomed that movie and will follow it to the grave in the turkey cemetery. they are both adaptations of books with a endless amount of pages who has been turned to a complete mess by a script writer and a director (in this case they are the same person.) who clearly don't know what they are doing, they have both a messiah wannabe that don't really deliver, as a hero (played in this case by a guy that looks like mark hamill but sadly the force is not with him.) and a bunch of stupid bad guys who likes to betray and mess up the life for each other, they are both containing scenes stolen from better productions and they are both cheap productions who tries to look expensive with some (often badly made) computer animation. the exceptions that actually makes the whole thing worse is the terrible work made by the lighting guy who don't even have the skills to turn on the light in his own living room, the camera work that for no reasons at all sometimes are in tilted "battlefield earth" mode but for the most of the time are flat as a pancake, the extremely cheap and to small desert set that only contents a pile of sand in the front of a backdrop painted as a desert, that turns very old very fast because it appears in almost every scene, and the bad idea by the costume designer to try to mimic "the fifth element"'s fashion madness with the addition of the silliest hats ever made. silly moments to remember: 1. every scene with the guild guys, who looks like mst3k's observer guys but with silly hats. 2. irulan shows up at the party dressed in her butterfly dress (why butterflys? -was the one with stuffed parrots in the cleaner?) with matching silly hat, together with a couple of guys with silly balloon hats. 3. paul the stand-up comedian. 4. baron harkonnen in over acting overdrive, screaming "i,m alive". 5. every scene with the backdrop, because it newer fits the foreground 6. every scene with the fremen's fake religious cermonies, specially the "water of life" cermony. 7. the battle scenes where the same guys gets killed a couple times and the same things explodes over and over again. it is a lot more but it is a 1000 words limit on this so i better stop before i gets carried away.

that's a weird, weird movie and doesn't deserve a better mark than david lynch's one! the special effects are badly made, the actors are majorly bad actors and in this movie it's not about a race which is the minority of a planet and tries to fight against the dominators, but it seems to be a crazy movie, which pays homage to sect kind of organisations. that's surely not the will of frank herbert, the author of the six part epic! check out david lynch's one, that's the perfect tribute to the novels!

i looked forward to watching this film since i loved the david lynch version. in my first attempt at watching it i fell asleep. nothing was happening. the next night i tried to watch the rest, and again it was putting me to sleep! nothing ever happened in this movie that could keep anyone's interest alive. the only time it got a bit more exciting was when i tried it on fast forward! the dvd came with a second disk which contained bonus material. needless to say, i had no hard to go through the torture of watching more of dune (2000). here are the low points: the acting was bad, the plot moved in slow motion, the sets were and looked cheap, the direction was pathetic, and the cgi visual effects childish.if you want to watch dune, save your money or rent the 1984 version.

this miniseries/movie was so terrible at times that i nearly broke down and turned it off. i am a great fan of the novel, however this movie suffers from multitudes of problems. the costuming is poor, and many of the more emotionally charged scenes are blase. the departures from the novel are poorly chosen, significant nuances are missed or rewritten.

i agree in many parts with the fairly thorough review already posted on the subject of the miniseries, and agree that it does have its pros, not only its cons. for example, the original film manage to truncate much of the middle and final sections of the novel into a single montage, including the discovery of gurney halleck and the love affair of paul atreides and chani, which, on reading the novel, is a travesty, probably born of the studio cutting shenanigens of which the other reviewer writes. this was one of the great failings of the original film, and the miniseries, to its credit, does include many of the original plot lines that were cut out of the lynch film due to the expansive nature of the herbert novel.however, this in itself is a double edged sword. rather than complete a text-to-celluloid transfer of the novel, the creators of the miniseries were tempted to create their own plot lines, absent from the original novel. similarly, although this is surely a "fuller" account of the storyline of dune, it is also a break from the originals heart and soul & main vision - that of prophecy. where are the internal monologues that characterize herbert's writing and demonstrate what the many different characters are thinking, without the need to suddenly switch viewpoint, or expand in words or unnecessary and stilted spoken monologues? gone. so much of the original agony of paul's decision to choose the jihad or death, the choice to fulfill the prophecy or swing away from it, surely the most interesting aspect of the novel itself (and one which captivates people who are far from science fiction fans) is missing. without prophecy, what is the point of dune? it is simply a more educated and learned version of farscape or andromeda. how sad that this is all we are provided with. lynch's film was flawed, yes. but a flawed film could lead to a correction by another film-maker, taking on some of the best points of lynch's film-making and rejecting some of the more overblown aspects of the style whilst restoring the storyline. now this story shall probably never be translated to film again, and this i find heartrending.

"the apartment complex" is a campy comedy full of kookie characters created in lieu of a real story which tells a young psych student (lowe) who takes a job managing an apartment complex and becomes embroiled in a murder mystery...um, if you can call it that. this low cal watch contains no suspense, no thrills, no drama, no action, precious few funny moments, a dash of nudity, and almost no romance. "the apartment complex" is passable, forgettable junk food for only the most needy couch potatoes.

i sat through this on tv hoping because of the names in it that it would be worth the time...but dear gussie, whoever thought this script was worth producing? the basic idea is excellent but the execution is appallingly bad, with a constantly illogical sequence of scenes, an ending that is almost laughably melodramatic and poor rock hudson wanders through this with an understandably confused look on his slightly sagging face. looks like a bad b movie from the 40's...

i suppose i'm supposed to take something like this with a grain of salt. these laboratory movies (and, yes, they spend a lot of time in the laboratory), always fail in one dimension: there is an understanding that single people fooling around have uncovered secrets beyond the comprehension of anyone to this time. of course, they pay a price because their experimenting has the same shortcomings that dr. frankenstein's did. there is always something they didn't anticipate. there are so many things from pure science to fashion for young ladies to outrageous cover ups that don't work here. the young woman is certainly fetching and the doctor can't help himself, but he could have been a little bit discreet or even made an effort to shelter what he was doing. things go wrong and because of this intellect, she gains tremendous power, including an understanding of how she came to be. rock hudson looks pretty fit here. he never quite makes it in this role, however. it wanders all over with lots of clichés and silliness which diminishes the basic issue. once she has her revenge a more suitable thing would be for her to wander off and allow him to seek her out and destroy her in some grand way.

rock hudson's second venture in the science fiction genre after seconds is embryo a film that combines elements of the bride of frankenstein and pygmalion in one rather weird film about for lack of a better word a test tube baby that grows up to be barbara carrera.hudson is scientist experimenting in organic development and gets a chance to first experiment on his own doberman pincher when it is accidentally hit by his car. some pituitary secretions from the female dog are given to a prematurely born puppy and it grows remarkably into an adult. exalted with his success, hudson takes a fetus from a dead accident victim and gives it some of the same stuff.what he gets is barbara carrera. and she develops physically and intellectually at a prodigious rate. what she doesn't do is develop emotionally. still hudson passes her off as his new research assistant to friends and family like sister-in-law diane ladd, son john elerick, and daughter-in-law anne schedeen. embryo doesn't explore some of the real issues in this kind of science, it exploits them instead. the special effects as they are, are pretty second rate. hudson looks like he lost interest in the project about halfway through the film.now what would have really been interesting is if he had gotten boy child and it grew up to be a harlequin novel hero. now that would have been something rock hudson could have sunk his teeth into.

after his career as a romantic leading man ended in the late 1960s, rock hudson starred in lots of different projects, including tv shows and lesser films. however, i believe that "embryo" is his only turn as a mad scientist, and that's probably a good thing. i guess he needed the work.driving along one dark and stormy night, brilliant dr. paul holliston (hudson) hits and injures a doberman, which he brings back to his lab (that looks somewhat like a dank midwestern basement). he then manages to raise the dog's unborn puppy outside the womb, so naturally he decides to do the same thing with a human being. he raises victoria (the beautiful barbara carrera) from a fetus the same way. victoria grows at an astonishing pace, and soon blossoms into a gorgeous young woman.predictably, things go very wrong. after a halcyon beginning, holliston's sister-in-law martha (diane ladd) begins to wonder where the young woman came from, and victoria herself begins to show signs of instability and violence. the final sequence is one long car chase straight out of "smokey and the bandit", after which victoriawho has shockingly aged in just a few minutesis assaulted by a frantic holliston, who tries in vain to destroy his malformed creation along with its unborn child. all of this is accompanied by screeching tires, roaring engines, a car fire, and lots of sirens. the limp endinga bunch of paramedics frantically working on victoria while holliston writhes in regretis more labored than creepy.although just made in 1976, this movie is very dated. the only difference between this and the many 1940s mad scientist movies is that hudson plays the lead role rather than boris karloff. the sets are pretty cheap and very antiquated to today's audiences, to the extent that hudson's reel-to-reel tape recorder is about the size of a refrigerator. much of the action takes place in a poorly lighted laboratory. hudson sleepwalks through his sordid role, giving the impression that he's truly a washed-up movie star, while ladd and carrera are much more believable. surprisingly, roddy mcdowall pops up briefly as a chess player.the passport video transfer is very substandard, looking as though it had been made from a poor vhs copy using home equipment. if you're nostalgic for 1976, watch this once just to say you did. otherwise, watch a football game or soap opera instead.

although embryo could have been a potentially thought provoking examination of bioethics, it degenerates into a stereotypical frankenstein parable, putting across the by now monotonous lesson that there were some realms man was not meant to enter or study.scientist rock hudson is experimenting with ways to prevent miscarried babies from dying. after success with a dog, he immediately jumps to humans-violating medical ethics and any sense of plausibility-with the equally unrealistic assistance of a hospital administrator. his experiment works too well, with some decidedly unpleasant side effects.although barbara carrera is reasonably good in her role, and some of the animal training is spectacular, the film suffers from being too fantastical. even though a message at the prologue assures viewers that this represents contemporary technology, the scientific work depicted looks far fetched even for the twenty-first century, let alone the mid- 1970s. furthermore, the scene where carrera is able to find a cure for the side effects of bioengineering simply by typing a question into a computer is laughable.

first and foremost i'd like to state - for the record - that it's incredibly dumb to call your movie "embryo" when the subject matter exclusively revolves on scientific research performed on fetuses (animal as well as human) aged 12-16 weeks. the embryonic stage is over at the end of the eighth pregnancy week and from that moment on the unborn critter enters the fetal phase. okay, in all honestly, i didn't know all this, but i took the effort of looking it up and that's the also the least thing the creators of "embryo" could have done. don't worry; i'm not just stumbling over details or being exaggeratedly bitter, as there are several more reasons to state why "embryo" is a huge failure. actual science can be considered as boring and inaccessible, and thus science fiction is a cinematic genre created especially to make the otherwise tedious, yet educational science topics more interesting and comprehensible to larger audiences. by depicting ambitious scientific experiments that go horribly wrong, or space missions that encounter evil aliens instead of light-years of void, filmmakers usually manage to entertain people with spectacular special effects and, at the same time, teach them useful little trivia about science. in order to make a good or at least halfway-decent science fiction movie, writers and directors only have to comply with one basic rule: don't be boring! if they can't fulfill this one condition, the viewer might as well read a theoretically accurate book. something must have gone wrong during the production of ralph nelson's "embryo". the basic premise is potentially fascinating and even involving, as we're all sensitive about saving the lives of unborn babies. there also were some very prominent names involved in the production, like main stars rock hudson ("giant", "seconds"), diane ladd ("chinatown", "alice doesn't live here anymore") and director nelson himself was responsible for the acclaimed classics "soldier blue" and "charly". then what went wrong? simple. the script is irredeemably boring, clichéd and the whole thing looks incredibly foolish because the lab scenery & scientific equipment is clearly too primitive to achieve any medical breakthroughs with. rock hudson, in a very poor performance, plays a doctor who hasn't put any passion in his research work ever since his wife passed away. when his car hits a pregnant dog on a rainy night, his passion returns and he does everything possible to save the dying animals' fetuses. he manages to keep one fetus alive, impressively accelerates its growth process and trains it to become an extremely intelligent dog. because his procedure is so successful, dr. paul holliston convinces his friend at the hospital to repeat his tests with the human fetus taken from the womb of a pregnant teenager who committed suicide. the female subject unexpectedly keeps growing at a fast rate, however, and after only a couple of weeks she's a full-grown, ravishing and super-intelligent woman. the good doctor naturally falls in love with her, but the groundbreaking new growth treatment also begins to show horrible side effects... absolute nothing happens during the first 45 minutes of the film, apart from a lot of implausible and overly melodramatic mumbo-jumbo and one or two deeply impressive tricks performed by the dog. that second half of the film does contain a little bit of (grotesque) action and suspense, but by then the stupidity of the dialogs and the implausible plot-twists already ruined the potentially fabulous sci-fi idea. there are some really cool scenes, most notably the chess-showdown between victoria and roddy mcdowall (in a highly memorable and ultra-obnoxious supportive role). the grand finale is absurdly grotesque and literally on the verge of ridiculous, and it almost feels like ralph nelson put in that final disastrous shot because it was the general rule in contemporary thriller & sci-fi cinema. the last sequence, including the horrible freeze-frame shot at the end, certainly doesn't fit the tone of the previous 100 minutes of the film. but anyway, my sincere admiration and respect to the dog and his trainers. an animal with such intellect and talent surely deserved to demonstrate its tricks in a much better film.

"a research scientist is experimenting with human dna in an attempt to create the perfect human being. his work has made it to the point where he can take a human fetus and accelerate its growth to that of an adult within a few days. his latest creation is a (spoiler omitted), but side effects from the process (spoiler omitted)," according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis."embryo" opens by promising: "the film you are about to see is not all science fiction. it is based upon medical technology which currently exists for fetal growth outside the womb. it could be a possibility tomorrow or today," according to dr. charles m. brinkman iii. right. and, dr. joyce brothers appears, later, at a party with roddy mcdowall.first, we see rock hudson (as dr. paul holliston) light a cigarette and drive recklessly (watch that speedometer!) during a storm; unfortunately, he hits a dog. mr. hudson takes the wounded canine home. he learns it is pregnant, and manages to save the life of one of the puppies, due to his experimental knowledge of fetal growth. what this really boils down to is that hudson uses an experimental drug to grow the embryo, so that it can survive outside the mother's womb. the dog, "number one", grows to adult-size rapidly, and is passed off as its mother.hudson lives with his sister-in-law diane ladd (as martha douglas); since his wife nicole, also a doctor, died in another car accident. ms. ladd seems more emotionally stable about nicole's death than hudson, who survived the crash that killed his wife. things begin to get creepy when hudson's dog shows an intelligence level far above any normal dog. then, hudson decides to use his accelerated embryo growth on a human, barbara carrera (as victoria spencer).hudson and the cast try their best; but, the "embryo" storyline is wretchedly absurd nonsense. if you take away her silly opening and closing scenes, ms. carrera's valiant characterization almost works; she might have been a bigger star, if offered better films than this. the infantile ending suggests a sequel; but, happily, the idea was aborted.

a buddy and i went to see this movie when it came out in 1980. it was playing in a huge theater and we were the only two people in the place. it lasted two days in the theater before they stopped showing it. it was so bad that we laughed all the way through it. since that time, we rate movies based on kill or be killed as the worst movie of all time. like other reviewers have mentioned, it is so bad that it is funny. it isn't worth a second look that's for sure. i just can't bring myself to give it more than a 1 because i don't think the makers of the movie intended for it to be so bad and i can't give credit for an accident. sorry.

master plan: have the winning team in a deadly tournament. one of several martial arts action pictures that attempted to capture the flavor of the famous "enter the dragon" from '73, this one is an effort from south africa. the villain's stronghold is a bit different, appearing as a white castle-like fortress in the middle of the desert from a distance. the villain himself, a baron or general, is a slightly more perverse version of the "dr.no" or han mold of master villainy, having strange flashbacks to the glory days of nazi germany. he does wear the full regalia nazi uniform at some points. his main ambition in life is to hold an illegal martial arts competition/tournament against his japanese rival, an extension of their complicity in the 2nd world war (my army is better than your army). it sounds silly and it is, though the suggestion of madness and crazed machismo almost works. the central hero, steve chase (ryan), resembles a white 'bruce lee' character, having a similarly lean, lithe physique, though obviously not on the same level of martial arts expertise. i thought he would be some secret government agent here but apparently not. he and his girlfriend have joined the baron's team of fighters, but decide to quit (what did they think they were getting into?). of course, it's not that easy. there's an odd sequence of them escaping through the desert using a wrecked car with a rigged sail - those desert winds can do wonders for travel, it seems.the plot kind of meanders in the 2nd half, as the hero joins the team of the villain's competitor and the girlfriend is held hostage by the villain in a cell, under threat of rape by the hero's rival. the most interesting character turns out to be chico, a dwarf who is the villain's assistant; he's loyal to the baron but is sympathetic to the plight of the hero. much of the fighting utilizes the ballet-like capabilities of the hero, with a lot of leaping and slow motion. the sound fx are also amped up and exaggerated in an attempt to add more impact to the blows. there are a few good fights during the tournament towards the climax, but none really stand out. if one had to pick, i suppose the best involves the brutish muscle man-henchman of the baron, introduced late in the story (he lifts the back of a car at one point). you wonder how the hero will take him out at the end, since the brute seems to shrug off most of the punches. the acting is very mediocre, descending into camp as far as the girlfriend, who tends to laugh for no reason, as if she's high on grass, though she is very cute. some of the training scenes are also campy, especially all those guys running over or rolling down the desert sands. and, with such a title, there's surprisingly few actual killings. ryan, as steve chase, returned as a traditional agent in the sequel "kill and kill again." hero:4 villain:4 femme fatales:4 henchmen:6 fights:6 stunts/chases:4 gadgets:2 auto:3 locations:5 pace:5 overall:4+

to be honest, i did never read one of the comics and cannot remember part 2 and 3 at all. i can compare to the first part (werner - beinhart) and this one here is really disappointing, compared to part1 as well as compared to most other movies i watched the last weeks. the first minutes seam to be just a needless clone of the first movie intro and then it is becoming even worse. there are a few good (funny) scenes, but in total it is just another boring second-rate try of german film industry that cannot succeed (nearly as usual). one good thing: the movie is quite short (75 min.) the bad thing: it only contains story and jokes for 45 minutes ;) -> don't watch it

having sat and watched this film i can only wonder at the reasons for creating the film. this was without a doubt one of the worst films i've ever seen and had no redeeming features.if it was supposed to be funny then it might have managed to be a very weak comedy but as an action thriller it was dire.slow, no plot, no real action, nothing approaching good dialogue and i've no idea about the characters. what else can i say. avoid.

i began watching this movie on t.v. some weeks ago, but gave up after the first 10 minutes or so. at the start, the person on the witness protection scheme located in an isolated farmhouse becomes nervous about his exterior placed guards, and then asks the guard inside the house whether he can make a telephone call - only to discover the line has been cut.shortly afterwards, roy scheider as one of the witness's assassins turns up and duly executes the witness and his wife - upon which the roy scheider character duly picks up the wall telephone in the kitchen, dials a number, and then speaks: it is done!!!! that was it for me!

directed by diane keaton and adapted from a book by franz lidz. a young mother selma lidz(andie macdowell)is battling a very serious illness and her self proclaimed inventor husband sid(john tururro)is a little lacking in the emotions department. unhappy with the new home situation, their sensitive son steven(nathan watt)decides he wants to stay with his two eccentric uncles danny(michael richards)and melvin(lou cutell)until his mom is well. steven seems to be happier and even takes interest in his strange uncle's living habits; he even decides he wants to change his name to franz. set in the early 60's, this drama is a bit comedic...change that to zany. not being a macdowell fan, unstrung heroes assures my attitude; albeit i enjoyed the film and it is not a total waste.

after reading the mostly glowing comments about this movie i decided to rent it despite some suspicions of tv movies. i should have followed my instincts.i tried so hard to warm up to the movie and find merit in it but i just couldn't. the story never draws you in or rings true and the acting is perfunctory at best and laughable at worst. everything in this production is amateurish.always a joy to watch, mary mcdonnell may be the only performer to escape this disaster without damaging her career or reputation. i won't even bother checking the name of the leading man - hopefully he's back doing commercials.even poor vanessa redgrave, whom i adore and respect, seemed to be channeling katherine hepburn all the time appearing as if she were really drugged in the home. maybe she needed the money.if i can save one person from wasting 100 minutes on this tripe i will feel vindicated.

this film is enjoyable if you like poverty row, public domain films from the first half of the 20th century, or are a fan of amateur film-making. the film splices together public domain thrillers together along with newly shot scenes in which the "actors" (with the sole exception of redfield doing a near dead on lugosi rip, all of the "performers" are simply dreadful!) attempt to interact with the stock footage. the "new" footage is covered with digitally added film scratches, as is some of the already substandard old footage (??!!). as near as i can figure out the plot has something to do with a bunch of strangers being brought together on an island for a will reading(?) this film, while boasting a creative premise ala 'dead men don't wear plaid', is a technical and creative wreck. in one dreadfully over long sequence and injured sailor on a ship describes an abortive trip to 'fog island', whatever that is! the "flashback" then incoherently weaves together old footage from totally different eras, and of totally disparate film quality. unrelated scenes from 'the lost world' (1925), the most dangerous game (1932), white zombie (1932), bela lugosi meets a brooklyn gorilla (1952) and some other poverty row productions. this is done over an incredibly bad voice over which seems to have too much room echo as if the audio was recorded on a cheap home video camera.the "filmmakers" seem to think that they are paying homage to the great actors of yesteryear by giving characters the surnames of famous actors (carradine, zucco, ouspenskaya, etc..etc..). this tactic was done cleverly, as well as subtly in 'final destination' here it's just obnoxious! bizarre, and painfully unfunny, jokes about spiderman, dracula, and superman abound. even the old as dirt 'dewey, cheetam and howe' lawyer reference is used here-this was old and tired when the three stooges used it in the 1930s.the film stock and audio, don't match scene to scene, and dozens of different sources are used for lugosi. the finale effect is that he seems to be getting, older, younger, older, thinner, heavier, younger and older again minute by minute. oddly the film didn't use this as a comedy subplot and squanders a good chance for comedy.truth be told though, it was great fun to watch this late at night in bed. maybe thats what they wanted to happen!

what a waste of time. i got about five minutes into it and became *very* antsy, and was soon fast-forwarding a bit, and pretty soon the desire to take my thumb off the fast-forward button was nonexistent. actors mark redfield and barry murphy did very capable jobs, i thought, but no one else i saw gave anything like a good performance. again, take this review with a large grain of salt because the movie was just so unbearable i couldn't make it to the end. heck, i couldn't make it to the middle !!i find myself unable to submit this review because it isn't long enough. maybe this last sentence will put it over the top.

problems: 1) although billed as "a loving tribute to poverty row," a lot of the old footage is not even from poverty row films-- much of it is from rko's "the most dangerous game," (1932), with some from the silent (!?) version of "the lost world" (1926)! 2) much of the old footage is just used as filler (the old shipboard footage) or as silent shots (for example, of bela walking, looking or staring) often repeated; 3) where is the pantheon of poverty row master thespians (bela, boris, lon chaney, jr., george zucco, john carradine, buster crabbe, tom neal, etc.) emoting their lines as punch lines to the 'new' characters jokes (as in woody allen's "what's up tiger lily?" or steve martin's "dead men don't wear plaid")? even mike nelson's feeble commentary on the colorized "reefer madness" is funnier than this. high point: the long but extremely enlightening lecture by gregory mank which makes you give new respect to and admiration for bela, john carradine and george zucco. that's worth the price of the dvd alone!

i was rather disappointed. the first tetsuo made me an instant tsukamoto fan, from the first 5 mins of the film. it was fresh, innovative, and just.....different. i rather enjoy having a movie be in your face and push all those "make you squirm" buttons. tetsuo did just that where for me, few movies can.for those of us who enjoy getting a breath of fresh air, those that appreciate those offbeat styles used that make indie films so worthwhile, testuo ii will likely be a disspointment. if your looking for that visceral "hyper-kinetic" feel of the first movie, skip this one, as thats all been stripped away. tetsuo ii is for some odd reason, just a typical hollywood style action flick. i was rather confused. however, it's still worthwhile in my opinion for any die-hard tsukamoto fan.

this movie was a disappointment. the story is essentially the shining with a castle (or a very cheap set masquerading as a castle, to be specific) substituting as the hotel and a monster instead of the ghosts. the budget is the same you'd see from a cinemax softcore porn, as is the photography, sets, lighting, and video it was shot on. the story is a failed attempt at sincerity: there's no easier way to make your audience feel sympathetic for your characters than to show them experiencing emotional trauma. and the trauma in this movie is pretty trite. want an example? a blind girl listening to a language tape teaching the italian words for colors begins to cry at what she will never see.this movie had a few things going for it, however: the monster is actually pretty cool, pretty scary-looking. and there is a pretty decent amount of nudity from raffaella offidani, herself a star of italian "erotic" films. the gore, however, leaves much to be desired, as does the acting, even from the experienced jeffrey combs.other than this i've only seen two other stuart gordon films: re-animator and from beyond, both of which were outstanding. but i won't let this little footnote in his career keep me from watching many more of his movies.

it's just a bad film.not as bad as r.i.c.c.o. but bad.it got me hooked at the beginging then totally lost me after that.the acting was way off then on then going way way way off.do not see this movie at all costs,trust me with all my heart!!!!the directors who are brothers are not the next hughes brothers,who made really great films like dead presidents,from hell,american pimp,and menace ii society.the only person who made me watch this was the acting of paris campbell,who will be a great actor one day if he makes better films than this.christina caparoula also did a nice job for what she got.i hope the fittest is 10 times better than this piece of crap!

i really enjoyed the film. it was really cheesy at times. (they destroy the villain with hair driers--but where are they plugged in?) it's a unique film though, and i enjoyed the acting of courtney draper and tamara hope. i also enjoyed fanuel (however you write it...) liking megan's charecter because she called him a dweeb. besides the acting, the "rewinding" and showing what happened on ariel's and then megan's point of view was quite interesting. i saw it twice and i'd see it again

the movie that would be included if mystery science theater 3000 had a home game version! the source material for tacky comments in this movie are endless. i found the video of terror in the jungle at a garage sale. what a find!

an unbelievable plot, laughable characters, and obvious errors (in one scene where several grass huts are supposed to be burning, a gas torch can be seen repeatedly trying to ignite one of the huts), this film is a real dog.

altioklar's populist approach manifests itself in all his titles, from the worst to the best. he doesn't care (or has no clue) about art, all he cares is to make people think they've got a kick in the groin by watching his movies. the problem is, the effort is way too evident, and as events unfold with all the senseless exaggeration kneaded into them, the effort fails badly.on this "turkish" movie (who knows where the original or originals were made, since it felt extremely hollywoodish to me), altioklar is trying to be some sort of tarantino. (mr. tarantino, if you're reading this, please watch the movie for the best comedy of your life!) he doesn't use subtle moves to do that, all he does is to use extreme stuff, and it gets unbearably absurd and laughable.levent üzümcü as the forensic guy with the cow-licked hair is just hilarious. i'm hoping to meet him in person and ask how he felt about this movie himself. because i really found the role insulting for him. demet evgar groping her genitalia was also uncalled for, and did nothing other than making everything look fake. another specifically idiotic aspect of this movie was the 100% faulty pace setting. when things need to be taken slowly, scenes flow abruptly. and at other times, it makes you sleepy to watch the slow ridicule going on.if altioklar is so deeply in love with lame hollywood superficiality, he should use michael sixarrows as his name instead. even such a move wouldn't be half as ludicrous as what he has done on this movie. he should first learn not to imitate directors whose levels he'll never approach, then realize he's not in hollywood, and then take private lessons from zeki demirkubuz or reha erdem on how to lay the flow of ideas out in the plot. this useless movie couldn't be saved even by those, but perhaps he can make watchable movies in the future by taking these steps.by the way i've seen some infamous failures such as propaganda and otostop, and i still can't divert from saying this one was the worst turkish movie ever.

this for one has nothing to do with the absolutely fantastic first flick. and of course us americans just have to remake everything successful into english, because man reading subtitles is sooooo hard isn't it! from what i've see in the new trailers with the adorable now pregnant jessica alba (well that sure ruins every teenage boys fantasy everywhere doesn't it!) it looks exactly the same but probably w/double the budget. i thought the original was one of the best horror/suspense/mystery flicks i have seen in any language in quite a long while. i would recommend watching that one and skipping this one all together, there is no reason to watch this as there is no reason this even called "the eye 2" except to capitalize on the excellence that was the first flick. do yourself a favor watch "the eye" with the volume turned up and get ready for some probable jumping. i watched it w/headphones on and was pleasantly surprised on the excellence that was the direction of the pang brothers. if "the eye" remake does well which i'm hoping it does for the sake of the pang brothers movie careers, but at the same time it seems a shame that people won't/can't see the original, because very often/almost always the remake isn't as good as the original. watch this one if one wants to be mildly kinda of boring flick, but the original is no comparison to this sequel in name only flick.

****probably will contain spoilers****after a successful attempt to get attention (i would not call making sure that you get help before you die a "failed suicide attempt"), joey finds out that she is pregnant and starts seeing images of spirits.overall the movie was a little slow going, but entertaining enough to watch the whole thing. for a horror movie, there were only a few minor creeps and thrills. halfway through, however, was a really good scary scene (i wont give it away though) :) i watched this movie because i really liked the preceding movie, the eye.i was a little confused, however to determine that, other than being a "supernatural suspense" movie from the same creators, the eye 2 had no relation to the eye, *whatsoever*; different cast, different story. the eye2 does not even have anything to do with eyes :\the movie had a few questionable scenes: joey attempts suicide 3 times (4 times, if you count the time when witnesses say they saw joey trying to jump in front of the train), she is associated with brutally defacing an attacker, she freaks out in a restaurant and witnesses say she was "attacking" people and yet she is allowed to go about her business freely, without even so much as a psyche evaluation or put in the hospital (for reasons other than her pregnancy).the movie was not the greatest horror movie, the story was rather far-fetched (even for a fiction movie :p ), the spooks were either few and/or nothing we have not seen before. however, it was an "interesting" story and once you know what the "truth" is behind the spooks, it was an interesting twist on the "ghost" story.i rate the movie 3 out of 10.

(the beginning might be a spoiler...)"the eye 2" is the sequel to "the eye". it's about a pregnant woman who is able to see ghosts and spirits after an incident happened to her.the sound effects scared the hell out of me though momentarily but that's the only scary thing. some of the scenes from the prequel are comparatively similar and repeated so the chilling effects certainly have chilled. "the eye" has quite a frightening and indelible impression whereas "the eye 2" is a forgettable horror-cum-drama film. omit watching this. watching "the eye" is good enough.

it is not uncommon for a celebrity to be faced with the proverbial "wake-up call". and, should they survive this event, they come to a deeper understanding and appreciation of their particular good fortune. however, in the case of comedian's, they are rarely as funny after their epiphany as they were prior to it. such is the case with martin lawrence. frankly, i pay little attention to celebrities as i have much better things to do with my life than to spend it monitoring others'. so, i was unaware of the majority of what lawrence had gone through prior to this film. it was interesting but, unfortunately, all to common. i was left with the larger impression that this guy's stand-up act just wasn't very funny. save the big life messages for a book, just be funny on stage. if you want to see a funny martin lawrence, go rent some of the old def jams for which he hosted. don't rent runteldat.

martin lawrence could be considered a talented man, but those days are long gone. runteldat shows a man who at once tries to play the sympathy card to his plight yet takes responsibility for it whenever he thinks it'll benefit his ego. the sad truth is that at this point in his life, his best days were behind him: his half-funny show was dead in the water after his co-star left and to today he faces a career of voice acting and god awful action films.one gets the impression that this concert film wasn't made to give lawrence's career another boost after his humiliation but rather a childish attempt to clear the air by both trying to pathetically salvage what remained of his life and somehow twist it into something to be proud of, some defining moment in which he showed himself to have 'earned' his fame. sadly, the concert is nothing but a gravelly-voiced martin incoherently trying to be funny, invoke pathos, and then claim he doesn't care about it at all because hardcore. the sad truth is that this is the real public embarrassment for lawrence: the way he rambles on invoking sad pity laughter makes you wish that he would just strip down to his underwear on stage, wave a gun around, and just reenact it all over again. there is no real insight to his performance at all. much like the childish title states, martin is trying to make his ultimate moment of truth his own in his way and fails miserably. he would have been better off waiting for the e! true hollywood story instead of running on a stage and making an idiot out of himself for the second time.perhaps the saddest thing about this concert film--or rather, career eulogy--is that martin didn't put any thought into this. what was this film supposed to prove? sadly, that his fame was fleeting, he was a flash in the pan before the underwear incident, and now that the only way he can get work is piggybacking will smith or a pixar production. they might as well called this concert 'tombstone' because that's what it is. martin lawrence just dies on stage here, and with it goes what could have been an interesting career. now? just a pathetic side note in history.

to paraphrase the previous reviewer's comments, if you're a stooges fan, avoid this one at all costs! my basic question is, being the experienced troopers of comedy that moe and larry were, why did they insist on attempting to continue the act when it was so obvious that their home studio, columbia, was so clearly not interested in giving them serious writers and veteran comedy directors? this movie plays like someone who's giving a pale imitation of the trio and you can see how very hard moe and larry are working to make every little bit of slapstick relevant. joe de rita, despite his background in vaudeville is just not up to the job as a replacement for curly, shemp, or even joe besser. if that's who moe and larry had left to pick from, they should have just closed up shop and enjoy their retirement years. leaving us fans with better memories of far better films they had done earlier. always leave them laughing is the motto for comedy and always quit while you're on top. hence seinfeld's leaving the sitcom while right up there, instead of sticking around for the inevitable decline.

barricade finds alice faye without any songs as a refugee trying to flee china and without passport. she's in a heap of trouble, i won't say what exactly, and even american extraterritoriality won't help her out.i mention that because one of the grievances that the chinese including the bandits who attack the american mission in this story set deep in the chinese interior was that particular institution whereby american citizens who committed crimes were tried by american courts set up by our consulates. we were far from the only country doing that however.anyway the story opens with her on a train for shanghai trying to use a hokey russian accent. the accent intrigues warner baxter who's pretty plastered.bandits however interrupt the journey and the two of them seek refuge in the american consulate presided over by charles winninger. he's the best one in the film and i only wish that a better story was given because i liked his character. he's a widower and a proud member of the consular service, appointed in 1900 by william mckinley. he requested a transfer ten years later and that's the last he was heard from. as assistant secretary of state jonathan hale aptly put it, he's the real forgotten man.baxter does all right in a role that someone like clark gable would have done in his sleep at mgm. the heroics would have come more natural to gable than to baxter as the mission is barricaded and defended against the bandits.alice faye did have one number to sing. why alice's song was cut out, god and zanuck only know. one thing i'm still trying to figure out is when the mission inhabitants take final refuge in the cellar with a trap door, just who was left upstairs to pull the rug over the cellar door? barricade had the potential to be a lot better than it was. but sloppy editing and lost faith in the project made 20th century fox release a project unfulfilled. watching barricade is like eating a badly cooked meal.

an anonymous film which could have been directed by anyone at all.where is anthony mann,the director of such classics as "el cid" " the naked spur" or "the man from laramie"?there are marvelous shots of planes in the clouds,lovingly filmed.the story is very trite ,and almost completely devoid of dramatization.the couple lives an almost routine life and the user who complains about june allyson's choice for the wife ,imho,totally misses the point.with her less-than-attractive look,her hoarse voice,she was the perfect housewife the screenplay needed.at the time,women were barefoot and pregnant:there 's not one single woman among the base staff,even in the desk jobs -.all they had to do was worrying about their hubbies ,who were fighting for democracy and against an enemy whose name we never hear ,but in 1955,it was not hard to guess it.one wonders why a young person who has never seen a mann movie should choose this one among all the great movies he made.

this film reeks of production line planning. it appears like the filmmakers looked at recent hit movies, and threw spaghetti on the screen - jimmy stewart! june allyson! anthony mann! baseball! war! baby! airplane! - roll 'em! - the film does address the age of the stewart/allyson performers; though, i'm certain we are still supposed to think they are much younger.there are messages in "strategic air command" i found curiously shocking and offensive, but i'll stick with one truly wretched element: the happily married couple is challenged when mr. stewart's character makes an important decision without consulting his wife. in the film's most dramatic scene, she calls him on it. it ends completely unresolved - allyson is crying her heart out on their bed, and stewart walks out on her. no discussion; he simply says he is correct, and walks out on his devastated wife. for all he knows, she could slit her wrists.later, allyson apologizes for questioning her husband's decision.unbelievable! stick with stewart-allyson in "the stratton story" (1949). ** strategic air command (3/25/55) anthony mann ~ james stewart, june allyson, frank lovejoy

if good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made. the film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care. it is about patriotism and about patriotism in a healthy way.not quite ten years after the film, i knew air force officers who taught my r.o.t.c. classes at university. they were intellectuals. they thought deeply about their work. they has senses of humor. one had been a crew member on the first plane to drop a hydrogen bomb. i have wondered if any one of them died in vietnam. i imagine that they flew missions there.regrettably, the film fails. the movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative. no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie. her susan holland is a woman that one would flee, not embrace. col. james stewart (who as then a colonel) makes a good stab at this role as lt. col(and later col.) dutch holland. but the most interesting thing he does in the role is bite into a sandwich. i'm not kidding. stewart was good as biting in sandwiches as he did in the spirit of saint louis. one might think of ted williams, but i don't when i watch mr. steward in the role. i do think of william holden as lt. harry brubaker in the bridges at toko-ri . the comparison is not good for mr. stewart, who seems wasted in this film.footage shot from a b-36 looks like outtakes from commercials for an airline. though beautiful, the aerial shots are mundane. for the time, they might have impressed viewers. the crash in greenland involves unexciting modeling you expect the outcome to be good.the undertone--the subtext-- for the film voices the tedium that air force flight crews must have felt during their long missions and the banality that the air force used to make its business--well business like any other business. one imagines how a la nouvelle vague director might explore this theme and then one begins to think about how someone with imagination might have filmed this movie. little moments are missed.when crews returned from long missions, the members of the crew got a shot of scotch and a massage before debriefing the mission. showing that might have helped.banality was the image the air force wanted and mr. mann accommodated the brass. maybe, in that sense, the film works, but not for me.i mourn when i watch the movie, because i think all of us, director, actors, crew, viewers, and members of the armed services might have enjoyed giving and getting much more than we get here.i don't think that this movie had to be dr. strangelove or 2001, both of which it presages, but it had potential never realized. yet, i enjoy watching it. i think of the airmen on their long missions and the ground crews in isolated places. there is a certain sense of honor celebrated here and i celebrate that honor. i certainly understand why people who praise this movie here and other places appreciate it. if there were no intentional fallacy, it would get a 10 from me..

it may be, although there are still two or three i've missed. this film constructs an interesting nocturnal cityscape, reminiscent of so many foggy scenes from sherlock holmes movies, and populates it with sinister, kafka-esque characters. into their midst, the movie drops mia farrow, who sounds like she's still playing hannah, and woody allen, who seems to be reprising his nebbish role from play it again sam. are we supposed to laugh at his stammering and hand-wringing? i suppose i would, if the rest of the movie were clearly a comedy, but it's not. at least i don't think it is.

"shadows and fog" is surely one of woody allen's weakest films, right up there with "september" and "hollywood ending" (though nothing allen has done equals the awfulness of "anything else")."shadows and fog" is allen's homage to the german expressionist style of film-making, all stark and stylized light and shadow and...you guessed it.....lots of fog. but you can tell allen got caught up in the technique and the parody and forgot to make a movie that anyone would care about.luckily, he made "husbands and wives" the same year, so things weren't a total wash for him.grade: d

a wonderful semi-humorous homage to expressionistic black and white films of folks like fw murnau, fritz lang, carl dreyer, marcel carné and others. allen plays a character caught in a kafkaesque nightmare, at first thinking he is part of a vigilante group trying to catch a killer and slowly realizing that he might be a suspect. the writing is a little forced (this is, after all, woody allen trying to be a coy kafka), but the point is made, and no harm done. the cinematography is interesting, about 100 shades of gray, but make sure you watch in a very dark room with a good screen, or details will get swallowed in the fog. this is an amusing little movie with a few laughs that are actually snorts of "uh-huh". the acting is fine, considering the odd vehicle, and it's worth watching if you are big woody allen fan. also of interest to those knowledgeable about expressionistic films. i'd give this a 6.5 out of 10.

meet cosmo (jason priestley), a nerdy young bookie content with his boring life crunching numbers for the mob and living in a stark basement apartment at a senior citizens center. his only recreation is watching tv and the occasional tryst with his quirky prostitute pal, honey (janeane garofalo). but one day all this changes, when the mob boss is killed and the well-regarded cosmo is selected by the smooth and persuasive new chief, gordon (robert loggia), to become a full-fledged hit man. it's an offer the reluctant cosmo cannot-repeat, cannot-refuse, and he quickly trades in his mundane, solitary existence for a crash course in revenge under the tutelage of veteran mobster steve (peter riegert), a relaxed, suburban bon vivant who relishes the job's maximum pay and minimum hours. in no time, cosmo surprises both himself and mentor steve by displaying an absolutely uncanny aptitude for the work. though he's never touched a gun before, cosmo proves to be both a crack marksman and, after an initial wave of moral hesitancy, a cool, detached killer. soon, cosmo is dispatching deadbeat clients with speed and style and his natural flair with a gun quickly establishes him as an invaluable addition to gordon's mob.reality gets in the way though, when one night, while being massaged by honey, cosmo admits feeling a bit uptight and she recommends he try yoga to relax. cosmo takes her advice and joins a nearby yoga class taught by a beautiful young woman named jasmine (kimberly williams). cosmo is instantly taken with the kind and gentle jasmine, who soon becomes drawn to cosmo. now if she can just get rid of her pesky, abusive boyfriend, randy (josh charles), maybe she and cosmo can actually start something. cosmo, using some of the "skills" of his new trade, eventually persuades randy to disappear and his relationship with jasmine takes off.writer/director m. wallace wolodarksy, a two-time emmy award-winner for his work on "the tracy ullman show" and "the simpsons", has fashioned a script fusing his three genre loves: "i like comedies, gangster movies and romances," explained wolodarsky, "so i essentially smashed together all three to create this film." but what he's come up with is a film so disjointed and improbable that it looks just like a very long sketch on saturday night live. it's monotonous tone doesn't so much match it's droll sense of humor, as underline the fact that a lot of money was spent on a vehicle for jason priestly to blithely shatter his nice guy image, which doesn't even fully succeed because he plays his character not as a nerd, but as a laconic zombie. a nerd may be naive, but a nerd has passion. passion for inwardly directed things. but priestly plays his character as mentally deficient, almost the anti-forrest gump. unfortunately, "coldblooded" doesn't have the sense of scope to actually be the anti-forrest gump.peter riegert (local hero, animal house) turns in a fine performance as usual, and kimberly williams does her best with what she has to work with, but janeane garofalo (hbo's larry sanders show) is practically wasted in her role as cosmo's friend. probably not for long, though. garofalo has all the enthusiasm and charm of an apple waiting to be picked and it's just a matter of time before she'll be given a meaty role, hopefully doing a tag team thing with marisa tomei.

can there be a worst film? even ed wood at his horrific worst couldn't come up with something this bad. cheesy, stupid, long-winded, preposterous...and those are the good points. i saw this trash back in the early 80's when i was incredibly bored to begin with, and actually sat through the entire thing without blowing my brains out, although that probably would have been a more pleasant experience. i actually remembered it because it was so bad. it makes me sad in a way because some of the best directors got their start by making tv movies (ie spielberg) and it was a wonderful way for them to get their initial material before the public, but crap like this just totally killed the entire process.

it is easy to tell early in this movie exactly what will happen, and who will die. it is about 4 women and a man who on a vacation. this was made during the end of the ultra nazi seventies, when blonde women were supposedly ultra american survivors and brunettes were all deserving of death.this movie, like the others of that era, contrives to bring this about, and the viewer knows this. there is no mystery or suspense. the people squabble, but everything is so predictable for the prejudices of the time, it is laughable.the five people happen upon two savage young characters, and go nuts. everyone is nuts, so that the director-writer team can justify their nazi propaganda.for some reason, the guy is attracted to the blonde, who is really not much to look at, and ignores a super hot looking brunette that any heterosexual man would go nuts over. one must remember that in the seventies, movies were meant to appeal to women and not men.totally crap and totally depressing.

you'll feel like you've experienced a vacation in hell after you have sat down and watched this horrible tv movie. this movie is an exercise in over-acting (very bad over-acting) to situations that made out to be more than what they are. i won't give away the plot, but once you realize why the people in this film are running from the native man in the film you will demand the two wasted hours of your life back. the only plus is seeing marcia brady running around in a bikini!

this has to rate as one of the cheesiest of tv shows in a long time.jose ferrer played the title character, nemo. he did the part justice and certainly looked the part. but nowadays, it strikes me that the nemo he was made up to be bore more than a passing resemblance to captain bird's eye, from the tv commercials. or maybe it's the other way around.his nemesis, professor cunningham, was overacted brilliantly by burgess meredith. he never seemed to get over his "penguin" days from batman. although he doesn't do his penguin "quack" here, he is without parallel as the maniacal professor. only john colicos, of battlestar galactica fame, chewed up the scenery better as a maniacal despot.i never can recall what the grudge was between nemo and cunningham, but it must have been severe, since the prof. never missed a chance to try and scupper nemo, and vice-versa.the effects were nothing special, though prof. cunningham's submarine was way better looking than nemo's. it also had a crew of strange, fish-like amphibians that served cunningham and did his every bidding.however, the most memorable aspect of the whole show was prof. cunningham's secret weapon. the delta beam! he was forever saying "fire delta beam!", whereupon, a fishy crewman would horribly overract the motion of firing the weapon by use of a full shoulder shrug. truly priceless! they don't make them like this anymore, and perhaps just as well. but like other series of this era, for those who remember it, it will always have an affectionate, if cheddar-covered, place in our hearts.

i know this film was shown on local tv when i was a kid, but i can't remember whether i watched it or not; seeing it now, considering how utterly forgettable it is, i still don't know  so i counted it as a first viewing! there have been several films featuring the title character, a creation of visionary french author jules verne; these include: 20,000 leagues under the sea (1954; with james mason in the role), master of the world (1961; vincent price), mysterious island (1961; herbert lom), captain nemo and the underwater city (1969; robert ryan) and the mysterious island of captain nemo (1973; omar sharif).this version stars academy award winner jose' ferrer. however, even if the premise itself isn't half-bad  awakened from suspended animation in his submarine, "the nautilus", and finding himself in modern times, nemo adopts all his ingenuity to aid the u.s. navy in defeating megalomaniac scientist burgess meredith  it emerges as easily his most infantile adventure yet! for instance: five seconds into the film, meredith's assistant  donning a steel mask  rants that "the world shall be ours!"); equally hilarious are the zealous gesticulations of the similarly decked-out midget, whose task it is to fire the professor's all-important "delta beam" - and how about those android-type minions aboard meredith's vessel who never seem to do much of anything?! ferrer manages to maintain his dignity throughout, but meredith is an embarrassment (in what is virtually a retread of his penguin characterization from the 1960s batman tv series and film) where the budget was so tight  mostly invested in bland production design and shoddy special effects, no doubt, and both evidently influenced by star wars (1977)  that, apparently, they couldn't even afford him a decent costume (he looks positively idiotic wearing a tie in a sub)! the supporting cast includes mel ferrer (playing a saboteur in the vein of joan fontaine from another irwin allen production, voyage to the bottom of the sea [1961], and who engages in a swashbuckling routine with his namesake inside the engine-room of "the nautilus"), lynda day george (unsurprisingly, she's the only female character around) and horst buchholz (as the king of atlantis  for whatever reason, nemo is obsessed with locating the famed lost continent).by the way, having been reduced from a three-part mini-series for theatrical exhibition, the film obviously feels choppy  though one is still able to discern where one episode ended and another began.

this film was utterly horrible. stupid premise, and horrible acting by all. whoever wrote this trash should be hanged. reminds me of a hack student film, but worse. who ever produced this should give up now. i know opinions are subjective and all, and some may think this "fantastic" as some think "dune (1984)" was fantastic, well get off your horse and watch some real films. ok, the acting was tolerable, and with better direction could have been far better, but it didn't so it suffers. i don't know how much more i can say about this waste of film, other than to totally trash it. anyways it was horrible and i recommend to avoid it like the plague, if you come anywhere near "dreamland", rent the movie beside it instead.

...i can't believe there are actually people here who recommend this movie... this is such a slow pos going absolutely nowhere. oh yeah ok it goes somewhere, but you see that coming from miles away. acting: really really bad, maybe the bartender was kind of ok. editing: bad! i suppose the editor was told "we need at least 90 minutes", cause half of all the scenes could have gone in the bin. music: don't get me started on that, the lousiest score i've ever heard. who is that singing in the last scene for crying out loud?? directing: oh my, imnsho david lynch sucks, but someone trying to copy him sucks even harder. skip this one.

this film has absolutely no redeeming features. it's not even worthy of being in the 'so bad it's good' category - it's simply bad. badly acted, badly shot, badly written, badly directed, terrible sound recording and the whole thing is just incredibly amateur. quite how this got a release is beyond me.oh, and could someone please tell the lead actress that if you're playing 'mad' that does not mean that you should constantly fiddle with your hair - in a film that was generally irritating, this was probably one of the most irritating things of all.on the plus side, i think this is the only film ever to feature a nazi carjacker ...

i cannot believe anyone is giving this film a good rating. in addition to the terrible acting, thin (nonexistent?) plot line and slooooooooow pace, this would be the movie to watch if you were really trying to fall asleep. the writer's and director's brains must have been fried eggs to ever have concocted something as abominable as this. based on the plot summary on the dvd case, the premise really sounded promising. but within the first ten minutes i knew it was a lost cause. if you want to see a really creep take on the area 51 idea, check out the remake of "the hills have eyes". dreamland will soon fade away as all pathetic films of its ilk do. next!!!

maybe james p. lay knows what do to in the sound department if a director supervises him.in 'dreamland (2007)' however, he cannot accomplish anything as a writer or as a director.there is absolutely nothing in this film, no story, no character building, no events, no atmosphere, no plot, no twists, no acting that deserves that name.in any of those departments this movie is billions of light years behind any short film that has some actual thinking in it, even a one minute one.it has nothing to do with any of david lynch's works!i actually think it could be used as mental torture or as negative propaganda material against the west.recommend it only to your worst enemies!

ed wood, perhaps the worst film maker of all time left us gems that are so bad, they delight, being unintentionally funny and therefore charming and innocent.james lay, and his financial backers (mom and dad, it seems from the credits) have created in 'dreamland' a film just as poorly made as any ed wood film, but lacking any charm or innocence. dreamland simply stinks, and about the only good thing about this 90 minute waste of time is the certain knowledge that james lay and his fellow perps will never make another picture again.i must mention some of the dramatic lengths some of the crew took to avoid being associated with this horrible picture. i'm sure the production controller, once seeing the completed film, demanded to have his or her name changed in the credits to 'donna snartlebutt' and the accounting done by 'brutus'. one can imagine 'brutus' with his roll of 5 dollar bills paying the crew at the end of a shooting day.i wont mention the many technical problems with this pathetic little videotape, but i must mention a few commentaries that compare this slag to the work of david lynch. you know you have turned out a real stinker when you have your mom log into imdb and post such astonishing bs - no one , save violent mental patients, could -ever- mistake 'dreamland' with -anything- produced by lynch. what a horrific slight against mr. lynch and his work.go back to film school, mr lay.

i have to say this is the worst movie that i have ever watched in my life, i cannot believe that i wasted $10 at blockbuster ; this movie should be burned and who ever thought of it has issues. who ever actually spent money to make this movie was insane =d this movie has terrible actors and some of the scenes make absolutely no sense. well, the whole movie doesn't make sense. also the part where those "men" come into the diner ( department of national securities )that happened to be the worst part of the film. how dare they say frank sinatra's name in vain? also, what is up with those glasses? when the guy and girl are in the car and she "drinks" water, you can totally tell that she isn't even drinking! also, what is up with the freaky dinner guy. and everyone knows that you don't stab tires, you slash them.

i never comment on a film, but i have to say that this was one of the worst films that i have ever seen. i feel it was made by a beginner film student and not to put down talented film students, but this was horrible! i did not buy the lead actress and felt i was in acting class with her while she was on film. her decisions were very safe and i feel she was mimicking other actresses in films and not acting and making her own decisions. the direction was very confusing and the sound was louder than the actors themselves. the end may have made a little more sense if there was someone narrating the events and not a song. i love patsy cline but she her songs appear quite frequently in films. maybe the song selection could have been a little more original. the song "crazy" was such a cliché. as i said before i never comment on films and have seen my share of good and bad, but this was the worst. sorry.

the lives of megan(jackie kresler)and dylan(shane elliott)change in the nevada desert between reno and las vegas. they stop to eat at a small greasy spoon where they reluctantly learn about the infamous area 51 by the café proprietor(jonathan breck). after getting back on the road in their forty year old lincoln, the radio gets a little crazy broadcasting hitler's speech at the 1836 olympics and then later a 1958 news bulletin of elvis presley being drafted into the military. the car slowly breaks down and the two are in for the scare of their lives as mysterious unexplainable things happen in the lonely radiation-poisoned desert; remnants of nuclear testing. megan meets a lost little girl(channing nichols)and a wounded wwii soldier. the nightmarish journey doesn't end there. kresler is impressive to a degree and writer/director james lay makes good use of patsy cline tunes. all in all, moderately interesting sci-fi.

i watch a ton of movies and enjoy the occasional b movie but this movie was awful. aside from the "homemade" quality of the film it was very slow and seemed to make no point. i'm only commenting b/c of another comment i saw here that said it was great! wow! maybe ok to watch on a rainy day when nothing else is available.the characters were disjointed and didn't fit any discernible pattern of reality. the dialog between characters was forced and at times very confusing.i guess if you were very into the whole area 51 and understood some of the nuances other comments reference, it may be good - but for me - the average joe - i don't get it!?

i watched this because of the description and cover art and yet again was deceived.i am getting sick of all these new stupid straight to dvd horror movies.once in a blue moon 1 will be ok. it started out with a confusing scene and then jumped 30 years and showed a couple one night during a thunderstorm which was ok because i like storms and it set a nice mood.then it turned into a cool road trip where they ended up at a diner encountering bizarre people.the rest got weird and then got confusing.i did watch it til the end but was even more confused when it ended so badly.i had higher hopes for this movie but it was more like a science fiction then horror and something that should have been made for tv.

dreamland started out moderately interesting but never went anywhere except tedium city. a low rent affair with no name actors and laughable effects, not recommended for any reason. the best thing that could be said is it looks like they really filmed it on location in the nevada desert. that's it, i can't think of one thing good besides that about this stinker. the finale is supposed to be some kind of revelation but falls flat like the rest. oh, i thought of one other good point about this cheese, it clocks in at just over an hour although it still wears out its welcome long before then. when the girl starts walking around in the desert at night it seems to last forever and just keeps getting worse from there. the attempts at horror aren't effective in the least. the story is an attempt at a twilight zone style feel but fails badly. check out "retroactive" for a good science fiction b-movie.

this is seriously the worst movie i have ever seen, right from the start the movie goes straight down hill with its cheesy music score, poor acting, and total lack or real story or plot. even for a b movie this is down right awful. after reading some of the good reviews i thought i'd keep an open mind and watch it. but all the bad reviews were so right. i totally can't understand how anyone could have enjoyed it. i'm a huge sci-fi fan and this was way more than i could swallow. definlty do yourself a favor a move on to a different movie. they are many other better movies that deal with this subject matter. you have been warned.

a really terrible movie, really low-budget, with terrible acting, a convoluted and inane plot, a modest reworking of the vampire tales mixed with modern science.the result is a total mess, without meaning for most parts, with very limited and cheap effects. it is not even fun, like several of the low budget independent movies of this kinda waste of time

a friend of mine loves tacky horror films so i often get to see low budget stuff like this. this is, however the first time i have been compelled to write a review of one...put simply this is probably the worst film i have ever seen! even worse then boggy creek ii!the entire budget for the film seems to have been spent on a brief scene in the middle when dr. klaus stands in this chamber thing & turns all vampire-ish.the only good thing to say about it is that it was hilarious after a few beers (but for all the wrong reasons).

how poor is this movie? well, i got it less than two months ago and can hardly remember what it was about...i also paid a £1 for this on dvd, the old story of 'put-a-new-cover-on-the-box-and-some-fool-will-buy-it' syndrome. all i really recall it that the cast ran around a lot, use of cars must have been too above the budget and that a vampire was involved. then again, guess you could know that from the film's title.straight to video rubbish or straight to cheap-jack dvd as it is now. this stuff will be in the bargain bins at rental shops, supermarkets and charity shops until the death of the sun. only cockroaches will rule the earth but this trash will still be around. god bless the dawn of the dvd age....

bought for £1, project vampire is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. wooden acting,lame effects and a terrible storyline all add up to be a movie you have no reason to even want to see. pv is one of those movies that don't even have the good grace to be bad in an enjoyable way, instead this bile seems to try to make itself as offensively dull,stupid and crap as humanly possible.a vampire has created a serum he sells to old people as a life-enhancer, and those who take it fall under his control. a former lab intern teams up with a nurse to try and stop him. someone should have stopped the makers of this rubbish.no one has any reason to see this movie, and i am actually appalled at the human race on the grounds that at time of writing 2 people have given this atrocity 10 out of 10.

ouch!! what a mess we have here. not so much of a mess as a painfully dull, half-assed excuse for exploitation. brought to you by the one and only, j. g. "pat" patterson, yeah, the same one from moonshine mountain. doctor gore, formerly known as the body shop, is, i guess, somewhat inspired by frankenstein, and god knows what else. the late mr. patterson also stars in this joke, as a heartbroken scientist/plastic surgeon, who has recently lost his wife in a car accident, and is driven insane from grief, to the point that it becomes clear that the next step is to slaughter countless females, then maybe rob a few graves for body parts, in order to "put together" the perfect mate. it won't be easy, but thank goodness his pal gregg the hunchback is available to lend a hand, and to offer moral support.if proof was ever needed that some peoples goals are not meant to be accomplished, here it is, gang. this patterson hayseed obviously never had any business directing anything, much less, following in the footsteps of good ol' h. g. as a master of gore. i've never seen a gore movie that just flat-out refuses to give the viewer a single reason to keep watching. even the gore is boring. almost remotely humorous at times, but impossible to tell whether it's intentional or not. i pick "not".shot in charolotte, north carolina (home of the california axe massacre), on, most likely, a 3-digit budget, by a guy, as untalented as he may have been, who probably had an appreciation for drive-in trash, so, maybe we should give good ol' j. g. a break, i mean, he tried (i assume) which is more that can be said for most, and this movie is better than any of the big-budget super-hero garbage the theaters put out these days, although, i realize that isn't saying much. besides, doctor gore is quite the improvement over patterson's previous failure, the electic chair, so it's slightly possible he would have improved his craft in time, had he not died, so maybe it's not all that terrible, especially compared to the other movie on the dvd, how to make a doll, so what the hell, check it out. 4/10

i don't know where to begin. perhaps the whole idea of this movie was just a disaster waiting to happen. there is nothing slightly humorous about a kidnapping. i don't know what was more offensive--the subject matter or david arquette's "performance". it was like watching a bull get it's penis cut off, although i think the bull felt better afterwards. the filmmakers should find something about sinatra other than his son's kidnapping to show (like, i don't know, his talent as a singer!!!!). his family shouldn't have to relive that horror. thank god it was just shown on hbo and not released in theaters. please don't watch this if you have any self respect.

yah. i know. it has the name "sinatra" in the title, so how bad can it be? well, it's bad, trust me! i rented this thinking it was some movie i missed in the theaters. it's not. it's some garbage "movie" made by the folks at showtime (cable station). geez, these cable stations make a few bucks they think they can make whatever garbage movies they want! it's not good. i am as big a sinatra fan as any sane man, but this movie was just dumb. boring. dull. unfunny. uninteresting. the only redeeming quality is that (assuming they did stick to the facts) you do learn about what happened to the captors of frank jr. otherwise it's just a stupid film.

underwoods goofy story about a young man(arquette) who convinces his friends that they should kidnap frank sinatra jr. (nicholas). the film is written ridiculously, direction is odd, dialogues are out of place and scrambled, the actors didn't do it much justice either, arquette is annoying throughout, ian nicholas was nonexistent, macy was decent, but only because hes a pretty good actor and probably just tried his best not to come out of this project with a totally embarrassing performance, he was at least tolerable. this is a stupid film in my eyes, boring at times, not entertaining, just a film that i wouldn't recommend to anybody. imdb rating: 5.5, my rating: 4/10

(only light spoilers in here)stealing sinatra is a half-slapstick comedy about dimwit kidnappers, dimwit victims, and a few other side-stories thrown in to eat up some time.you will see some poor performances all around in this movie. the drama is forced, and the humor makes no sense. whether you're watching the kidnappers threaten the victim who won't shut up, or a victim's father responding to the criminal's death threat with "care for some tea?", none of it is believable. this quite comfortably fits into the "wannabe movie" category.you will also be listening to a repetitive goofy music track throughout pretty much the entire movie. it's quite unprofessional, and adds nothing. it's really just a sad attempt at making an achingly unfunny movie seem somewhat witty.however, if you're able to look past all of this and suspend a lot of disbelief, you might be entertained by the adequate storyline.i voted 4/10.

i'm a fan of the 1950's original and about 20 minutes into this remake i started to think this was going to be as good as the original but it wasn't. the motive for the murders was incredibly stupid. two of the lovers in the movie turn out to be brother and sister-excuse me while i barf. the main character stops in the middle of the movie to have sex which doesn't make sense considering the situation he's in. if the film makers wanted a sex scene they should have put it earlier in the movie before the main character (dexter played by dennis quaid found he's about to die and that he's accused of a crime. there is a reason for where the sex scene is at. early in the movie dexter isn't living life to the fullest so he's not interested in sleeping with meg ryan. i still feel it would make more sense for the sex scene to have either been cut or earlier in the film and the two siblings not to have been lovers.one of the dumbest parts of the movie involves a gun fight, a couple people getting killed and one person being run over all within 15 yards of a crowded carnival and yet nobody at the carnival notices!!! also in the scene is the tar pits the university where the movie takes place is built on. if you fall into the tar you sink to the bottom and in a matter of seconds. not only is it hard to believe stuff would sink that fast in tar, but more importantly who builds a university on tar pits. i would say more about how stupid the end of the movie is but i don't want to put a spoiler in my post.

great story and great lead actors (quaid and ryan) but the movie suffers from bad directing,bad screenplay and bad script.the lead actors do their part but could not save the movie at all.too bad because this could have been a good 80's style hitchcock suspense/mystery/thriller.ryan looked so young and fresh in this one though.an ok look for big ryan fans.....

rudolph maté's film from 1950 is given a revamp for the 80's, dexter cornell(dennis quaid) is a university lecturer who used to have a successful writing career, but thats now gone down the tubes along with his marriage. the initial exposition plants the notion in the viewers mind that everybody has something against him, so when the revelation comes that he has been poisoned, we are not that surprised, unless of course you are familiar with the original. dexter after being told he has less than 48hrs to live, decides to trace back his steps with the help of one of his students sydney fuller(meg ryan), but they find they have many obstacles in their way.the film begins promisingly in black and white, as dexter staggers in the rain towards the local police station where he wishes to report a murder...his own, but the huey lewis style 80's beat that accompanies this scene only serves to remove any sense of tension and tells the viewer that this is going to be pretty bad, its only a question of how bad? sure enough we are soon using the old flashback medium, but now the film resorts to full technicolor. there are some brief homages to noir, as the embracing couple stand in front of a venetian blind, but there's really nothing here to recommend it, the performances are awful, ryan in particular doing her usual dizzy blonde with a cutesy pie smile routine. the film is a lazy attempt to put some unneeded ooomph into an already fine movie premise, obviously trying to cash in one the body heat audience, the seeming results are undoubtedly aimed at a teen audience and to be sure, they are welcome to it. 4/10

danger: watch for falling spoilers...boy, was this a bad movie. i know that they were going for a "true love conquers all" kind of thing, but about all this film conquered was about 3(which felt more like 9) hours of my afternoon which i will never get back. the movie is about two young lovers named kai and gerta who live in a remote town in a fantasy world. kai is the much-abused bellboy at a hotel owned by gerta's father. at first gerta ignores kai's advances but she eventually warms up to him much to the disgust of (you guessed it!) gerta's father. as if this obstacle wasn't enough to overcome, an evil snow queen shoots a shard of glass in kai's eye and he becomes a mean person treats gerta poorly. kai is eventually taken to the snow queen's fortress (which is the same set as the hotel just covered in ice, because the good people at hallmark like to go all out) and gerta sets out on a mission to get kai back. along the way she runs into the 3 other seasons that are evil in their own special way, but gerta escapes them with the help of some dull and forgettable characters she meets along the way. (all the while you will want to turn it off, but can't force yourself to do it. it's probably the most evil and most effective spells cast by the snow queen) anyways, i will spare you from the ending because anything you can think up in your head right now is probably better then how they ended it. so, in conclusion, the snow queen is an incredibly boring movie, which takes the fan out of fantasy.

"the snow queen" is based on the famous and very beautiful fairytale by hans christian andersen, about a girl, gerda, who goes on a dangerous journey to rescue her friend kai from the clutches of the snow queen. this adaption attempts to capture that story's sense of adventure and luminously intricate imagery through lavish sets and production design, but fails on a number of counts.like so many hallmark productions, the potential of the story is completely undercut by heavy-handed scripting and direction. the two actors playing gerda and kai are blandly pleasant but forgettable; bridget fonda as the snow queen looks the part but is otherwise miscast for the role. there's a notable lack of dramatic tension to this meandering three-hour miniseries. at least some of the pacing problems can be attributed to the addition of filler scenes that add very little to the original story, particularly in the opening hour that introduces the main characters.that said, "the snow queen" would be just about ideal for pre-teens with a liking for fantasy and a bit of patience. it's great eye-candy without being scary, and the acting is pitched at the sort of pantomime over-the-top level that spells out the storyline in very, very bold text. just make sure you read them andersen's story too.

sometimes hallmark can get it right - like the 10th kingdom - but many of their fantasy films plod, and this falls into the latter category. the version i saw may have been cut (a demon [?] shown in the trailer and publicity stills didn't appear), but anything that made the movie shorter can only be a blessing.possible spoilers if you are unfamiliar with the original fairy tale:anyway, the film updates the story to the early part of the 20th century (?), and makes gerda and kay (here called kai - being a lexx fan, i kept expecting him to say, `the dead do not solve puzzles') 18 year olds. hans christian andersen's basic story is followed: the boy gets a shard of ice in his eye, goes bad, is taken off by the snow queen to solve a puzzle in her palace and gerda goes to find him, having various adventures on the way.as the two main characters are older than in the original, a lot of time is spent getting them together and `in love'. unfortunately, i was never convinced that they were particularly in love, and certainly not enough in love to make sense of gerda's quest. by the time the main plot kicks in, the movie's pace has slowed to a crawl. alas, when gerda begins her search for kai, it only manages to pick up the pace to a leisurely stroll.there are a few odd additions to the story that seem to go nowhere. at the start of the film the snow queen kills gerda's mother, but no explanation for this is given. a polar bear living in the snow queen's palace is more than he seems (though this is possibly because the producers realised that the bear's feelings towards the snow queen would be ok in a fairy tale, but not in a modern film). again, this is never explained. also, hints that the snow queen has an erotic desire for kai are dropped, but never followed through. the script is also full of anachronisms that really jar you out of the `fairy tale' mood.the production looks good, though there is evidence of penny-pinching: the snow queen's palace is the hotel where gerda and kai lived covered in ice. the three main characters are played with varying degrees of success: kai comes across as bland as does gerda initially, but once she sets off to find kai you warm to her. bridget fonda looks great as the snow queen, but seems to be in a different movie to everyone else.ultimately, the film is unsatisfying. it looks good, but drags and lacks magic.

this 3-hour made-for-tv miniseries came home with us from blockbuster's this weekend. the production company clearly spent a lot of money on sets, costuming (bridget fonda, especially), and special effects (including a great jim henson talking polar bear & reindeer). they should have spent a bit more money getting a coherent script. the story line was so loose that it really never came together. one can overlook irish-accented germans, but not herky-jerky storytelling. with senseless loose ends which included a special guest appearance by the devil, this one is certainly not destined to be a christmas classic. a shame that they wasted good performances by the two female leads.

for all intents and purposes, showtime was the worst movie i have ever seen.why? because having deniro in the cast adds immediate credibility and makes you want to watch the movie. i had also made the mistake of watching 48 hours and beverly hills cop recently before seeing showtime and for some strange reason thought eddie murphy was still funny. well he's not. in fact it almost seems like he has been neutered. as i watched this movie i was in amazement that deniro decided this was a good enough script to lend his name too. no chemistry between him and murphy whatsoever. horrible writing, horrible jokes, a movie that you think is supposed to be good can't get much worse than this. not too long after sitting through the wretch that was showtime i happened to watch national security starring martin lawrence. the movie had its funny parts but wasn't that great. but still it was 20 times better than showtime. please if your a deniro fan do not watch this movie!!

disney-like entertainment with some un-disney-like moments of graphic violence and sexual references. lousy comedy alongside cliché-ridden moralizing. noah as abraham, lot as his wicked buddy. laughable special effects. overdone acting with bad timing. sodom and gommorah were destroyed before the flood? strange twists and too many sub-plots the bible doesn't mention. god as a doubting father who just needs to be entertained by whistling before deciding the world has to be saved from disaster.b-movie wannabee director john irvin adds another failure to his worthless list of poorly-directed movies that seriously lack plot and direction.

just when i thought nothing could be as offensive and/or irritating as a billy mays infomercial, i had the intellectually shattering experience of renting this piece of garbage. peter barnes and john irvin should be brought up on criminal charges for smuggling this script into the public venue. the actors need to be charged as accomplices, serving no less than a lifetime away from the public eye.this production offers the disclaimer, "for dramatic effect, we have taken poetic license with certain facts", or some such inadequate statement to fully brace you for the absolute repugnant rewrite of a bible story which needed no drama added. what they did add was enough to make your i.q. drop three full points for every five minutes of viewing time.the "poetic license" taken, invents characters so bizarre, you'll recognize nothing but the names of a few, and, of course, the ark.for some reason, noah and lot are both living in sodom, so maybe abram was vacationing in switzerland on a skiing trip. lot's wife, played by carol kane, is a harpy, and when she's turned to a pillar of salt, lot breaks off her finger and carries it around in what appears to be an empty baby food jar. if that's "poetic", i'm a kumquat.when noah - who has now begun drinking wine in quantities that could help float the ark - whines about the tough job of the building project, he awakens one morning to find that god has delivered enough precut lumber to lighten his burden. at least i think it was god. it looked like a delivery from 84 lumber, neatly stacked and bundled. maybe 84 lumber is really an agent for god????? rather than bore you with the cargo being loaded, i'll regale you with the account of the pirate attack on the ark. incongruous, you think? this movie is filled with such insulting nonsense. after an untold time on the waters, noah spies a pirate ship heading right for them. and who might the salty sea-captain be? well, duh, it's lot, of course! my only surprise was that his uncle abram wasn't aboard. if you're going to slaughter a plot line, slaughter all of it. the piracy attempt is unsuccessful, and the swashbuckling was pathetic, not poetic. i think it was around this mark that my nausea prevented me from punishing myself anymore.an ugly, senseless, moronic distortion of anything remotely resembling a bible account. on a scale of 1 - 10, this movie is premeditated mind abuse. stupid and insulting, you'll be more entertained by reading the yellow pages.

i have wanted to say this since i first saw the movie, i still will not allow any of my children or grandchildren to watch this. at least not until i tell them and they understand that it is completely fiction. the only thing that i saw that was correct was that animals went onto the ark, everything else was false. lot and noah fighting on the ocean like a pirate movie. make sure you tell your kids the real story before you allow them to watch it, but really, until they are old enough to understand that it is not real they may have a messed up vision of the bible. this was the worst bible movie i have ever seen. bruce and evan almighty were much better and had more to teach. let your children watch those

this is pure crap, and probably the worst biblical theme film ever... absolutely inaccurate, i mean, they've put sodom and gomora before the great flood. they've described lot as a friend of noah although he lived after noah. to make things worse, later lot became a pirate and attacks noah's ark during the flood!!!??? and what's with the merchant who comes along on a boat which is moved over the water with a bicycle mechanism??? and exchanges alcohol for a food and water, and then noah is portrayed as alcoholic!? mockery, and continuous blasphemies one after another, and it goes on and on, and on... film maker and all participants surely secured themselves the front row in hell with this garbage...please stay off this crap, because you will save yourself nearly three hours of your life.

i was so excited to see the cast in this movie that i was completely surprised at how completely wrong this movie was. i love john voight but i have no idea what possessed him to be a part of this travesty. the biblical accuracy was completely non-existent and i honestly could not stomach watching the movie with my children. my kids stood astonished because even they know that lot was not even thought of when noah was building the ark. i think that nbc should be ashamed of themselves for allowing producers to make a mockery of the word and cause even more confusion in a world that barely knows the truth as it is... please do not buy this movie!!! i have considered burning my copy but i have every intentions on writing the producers and sending them the scripture references that they should have read before making this movie!!!

nbc should be ashamed. i wouldn't allow my children to see this. i definitely would tell my church to stay away. this movie is proof as to why nbc has always been a 3rd rate network the producers, actors, and writers should get on their knees and beg god's forgiveness for making this work of fiction. there were no pirates. noah's wife didn't parade around on the deck of the ark. the ark had no deck. lot wasn't even born when this event took place. did anyone attached to this project try reading the bible? there were more than two animals of each type taken. read the story in genesis. how could anyone bring this to any screen, small or large!

how this film could be classified as drama, i have no idea. if i were john voight and mary steenburgen, i would be trying to erase this from my cv. it was as historically accurate as xena and hercules. abraham and moses got melded into noah. lot, abraham's nephew, lot, turns up thousands of years before he would have been born. canaanites wandered the earth...really? what were the scriptwriters thinking? was it just ignorance ("i remember something about noah and animals, and lot and canaanites and all that stuff from sunday school") or were they trying to offend the maximum number of people on the planet as possible- from christians, jews and muslims, to historians, archaeologists, geologists, psychologists, linguists ...as a matter of fact, did anyone not get offended? anyone who had even a modicum of taste would have winced at this one!

recently i borrowed a copy of this mess of a movie, which took me three sessions over three days to get through. that's another comment in the making.but what i wanted to comment on first was the carelessness on the special features of the dvd. it included a game of memory, which asks the player/viewer to match up pairs of animals in order for them to board the ark. however, every time it reveals the chosen animal, the screen prompts the player to find (or congratulates the player on finding)"it's mate." this is a spelling error since it should be "its mate" as possessive pronoun, not a contraction for "it is." it is an annoying error to keep repeating 16 or more times to finish a game. of course, it's a kid's activity really, but teaches kids incorrect spelling.and, oh yeah, the game never changes. it is the same game with the same locations of the same animals each time. plus it doesn't keep score, like the number of moves it took to solve the game. so there is no lasting value or challenge to it. it's just a feature to list on the packaging.simply put, there could have been more thought and care put into this "special" feature, just like there could have been more thought and care put into this muddled film.

i've seen some bible-based trash. this one tops it all. to make matters worse, it lasts about three hours. a horrible waste of time, unless you want to match your kid's biblical knowledge against the innumerable aberrations. do yourself a favor - take a walk in the sahara instead. since i am required to give you a ten line statement of why not to watch this movie, let me just say there is absolutely no redeemable quality to it. god's conversations with noah are ridiculous. the whole thing has a stench of "let's make the biblical account look retarded." the basic logic goes, if they spent the money on a biblical film, why not make it worthwhile? since the basic logic is not met, something is amiss. the movie starts with a disclaimer about poetic licenses taken...that is the understatement of the century. poetic rape. but then, poetic would be an unmerited favor.

i don't understand jokes. i do believe this is my problem with modern cinema, or those films that are made with millions of dollars in hopes that it will become the next greatest sensation. isn't it odd  people just don't laugh as much anymore, and i do believe one of the diseases to that problem is the film "showtime". there was absolutely nothing, from the beginning to the end of the credits, with all of the bantering between murphy and de niro, with russo as eye candy, with even standard clichés which make the general population swoon with pre-programmed laughter, there was nothing in this film that made me laugh. there weren't the overbearing physical jokes or the calculated mental vocal jokes at all throughout this debacle of a film. from the beginning, i didn't buy the match-up of de niro and murphy as anything more than hollywood excitement, throughout the commentary the director vividly talks about the hijinks and laughter going on during the shoot  where was it in the film? this falls to either two problems  the director really doesn't have a sense of comedy or the editor didn't understand the value of the film. either way, they both doomed the entire hour and a half spent on the hollywood nightmare "showtime".outside of finding no reason to laugh, there was no reason to follow these characters through any moment of the film. there was a glimpse of humor with de niro's desire to pick up pottery as a hobby (but the director had to write kiln on the machine so audiences would understand  who does that?), but that was dropped and never developed. there was the idea that murphy was an actor, but outside of that one opening monologue, nobody would have understood that. he rents a room in a producer's house in which he can afford on a police officer's salary? this just didn't compute even for hollywood standards. there was a bad guy who wanted a big gun, but the gun was never developed, nor was there any true test of the weapons capability  even at the end. it became a bigger joke to laugh at an accent than remember the guns. where was the television show in this? russo had to get permission from this random guy at the beginning, but there were no consequences. there was nothing in the middle of this film outside of further questions and meaningless dribble. random characters were introduced, forgotten, re-introduced, and forgotten all over again. the director and producer laughed at this, while we, the meager viewer, must suffer through inside jokes and cliché stereotypes.was there a love interest in this film? was there a truly sinister bad guy that went apart from the comic duo to bring true evil to the screen? were there any pop culture references that didn't come back to robert de niro? was there random chaos throughout this film? if you need the answers to these, obviously, you won't find them in "showtime". the fact that i am riddling this review with question upon question, only means that this sub-par (actually, well below sub-sub-sub par) filled no quota or resembled anything of value to the cinematic world. sure, it had big names and one really neat explosion, but there was nothing of substance to this at all. it was almost as if the director said prior to the shoot that he wanted clichés, but not regular clichés  go with the bad ones. the plot had no linear structure. the jokes were boring. the characters were drab and underdeveloped. this ranks below even the best of "buddy-cop" films. i like to give films the benefit of the doubt, but nothing worked in this film. not even shatner could save this film, and he even tried hard.overall, i cannot, nor will i, suggest this film to anyone with a pulse. the commentary only confirms the pathetic nature of the film with obvious flaws, horrid jokes, and creators questioning the validity of their work. if creators can't stand behind "showtime", why should we? i didn't want a "lethal weapon" when i watched this, but i did want something like that. i understand there was some form of criticism of "reality television" and the corrupt nature of the media, but that message didn't make it off the page. in fact, i believe i saw "media" leave the theater first when i watched this. shame carries its heavy hand with this film and i cannot blame it. murphy used to be a big star, comedy was his middle name (see "coming to america"), but lately he seems to have lost his edge. de niro obviously wants to get away from an image that haunts him, but making these sort of films is only going to set him back further. one of these films is equal to one scorsese picture.skip this one. i promise, it will make your final cinematic days worthwhile. oh, and if you laughed at any of the jokes in this film  i am truly sorry! grade: * out of *****

i think hollywood should seriously consider never doing another "biblical" film again, if noah's ark is going to be the norm. aside from the horrible, completely uninspired acting from the whole cast (voight and steenburgen undoubtedly rue the day the agreed to do this film), the time line has been completely rearranged. i also missed the part in genesis about the pirate fight on the deck of the ark or the traveling salesman coming by on his paddle boat. hello? everyone else was dead except for noah and his family according to scripture. god stacked lumber and added plans to build the ark when noah questioned how?? i also don't remember reading anything about noah's wife constantly nagging him during the 40 days, or noah wandering around glassy-eyed and dazed all the time. the script writer obviously had very little knowledge of the book of genesis, or just didn't care that his abomination of a story completely mocked it.

this film is a completely inaccurate depiction of the real story of noah's ark. the producers probably did not even read the bible. this is the worst movie i have ever seen! noah's wife was never mentioned by name in the bible, but the writers of the film "gave" her the name naamah. this movie depicts the destruction of sodom a good 1000 years before it happened, and what about gamorrah? it too was destroyed at the same time sodom was. (maybe the producers thought that not including gamorrah in the story and showing the city of "sodom" as in you-know-what would raise more eyebrows.) this film is utter filth and mocks god and the bible. it is a wonder that any true christian would want to participate in the production of this abysmal, hideous, reprobated mockery of the bible.

this rendition of "noah's ark" has set hallmark's (and turner's) reputation back about 100 years. however, the production has it's bright side...a learning experience for neophyte movie entrepreneurs in "how not to make a movie"where in the annals of biblical literature and common sense can one find these quotes and situations:"ok, boys, let's saddle up." "it's too bad that god created the sun to shine only during the day when we really needed it at night." "we're not kissing...we're only whispering in each others' mouths."lumber for building the ark with "georgia pacific" stamped on it. metal nails. kids flying kites. a peddler (how can james coburn sleep after this) selling chinese hats. pirates attacking a wooden ark, which they wished to capture, with flaming tar balls of fire shot from catapults. glass bottles of wine (noah was in a continual state of inibriation. it was a miracle that he could see the ark let alone build it.) lady godiva (mary steenberg in a blond wig tromping around the ark on a white horse...still rated g) warding off biblical pirates with an iron (teflon-lined?) frying pan. landing on mount ararat after having passed through the straights of hercules.etc., etc., etc.special effects...you've got to see them in order not to believe them.the list goes on. this movie must not be missed; but if you want the full tv version, you must call nbc for the screen version...but only if you agree to absolve nbc of all responsibility of ever having aired the thing in the first place. only the expurgated version exists in video stores (no pirates, etc.)...that is, those video stores that dare to stock it.marvin cohn

oh boy. where do i begin on this piece of slime? this is one of the few real high-budget films on my list that i've actually seen fit to give a 1 rating, and that's not for the production values, which are pretty high. this movie has absolutely no respect for the account in the bible, and treats the whole story as laughable fantasy. i could not recommend it to anyone, except to see how low as a society we have become...for the first thing, noah was absolutely not friends with lot. anyone who actually read genesis could tell you that abram was who they were thinking of. the writers were just trying to pad out the story with the whole sodom/gommorah subplot, and it seems out of place because it is. noah is treated as a prudish goofball ("you were kissing! you were kissing!") but at least it's a step up from voight's hilarious overacting in anaconda. however, these offenses pale in comparison to the heretical treatment of god in this movie. god is portrayed as a petty, incomprehesible being who changes his mind at the slightest whim. ("i'm one eternal perfect, but i can be wrong") what? where are they getting this from? this kind of god...no one should ever pay any attention to, much less worship, praise, or love. what the director's saying in this, i do not claim to know. i just know that a responsible treatment of noah's ark should not take such an easy way out. shame on these people.

how offensive! those who liked this movie have probably never opened a bible. i can imagine those at nbc saying, "ok. let's make a movie to appease those pesky christians, but they'll never know the difference if we don't have anything factual or in the correct chronological order." well, they were wrong. anybody associated with this atrocity needs to find a church and repent for their involvement in this blasphemous atrocity. i only gave this movie a 1 because i couldn't give it a 0.

even though i have great interest in biblical movies, i was bored to death every minute of the movie. everything is bad. the movie is too long, the acting is most of the time a joke and the script is horrible. i did not get the point in mixing the story about abraham and noah together. so if you value your time and sanity stay away from this horror.

who wrote the script for this movie, the staff at disney studios?! this is the most inacurrate adaptation of any story ever! i wanted to laugh at a few scenes and cry at others, and that was only because of how pitiful it was. i'll have to hand it credit, it did have a few funny scenes, but i could've spent better time with my evening. very seldom do i turn off a movie after only a quarter of the way through.

how can so many blundering decisions can be made. all that waste of resources!its an idiotic story to begin with but theres no need to make it worse.a loose interpretation? are you kidding! it diminishes my regard for voight and coburn.i hope they were paid well.

i just wanted to say that i was very disappointed after seeing this movie! i was expecting a biblical story visualized with great special fx, etc. but during the film i found out that this was an absolute disaster... it wasn't biblical at all... only the boat and the animals were similar to the story... if you want a visual 'translation' of the bible version of noah then don't go watch this movie!

this move is terrible. they took gods word and made a mockery of it. the acting was terrible too. why bother doing a story on something from the bible when your not even going to tell it correctly. there were not just a few changes but the whole thing was wrong. do not see this movie.

bubbling just beneath the surface of showtime is a good idea. actually, it's more like two or three ideas that constantly fight for screentime. this film doesn't just have its cake and eat it too; it has the whole bakery.detective mitch preston (robert de niro) has a drug bust interrupted by the media and a brash, cop-slash-actor named trey sellars (eddie murphy). when preston's partner is shot, he angrily shoots the camera out of the hands of a pestering newsman, and the tiff lands him in a new reality cop show produced by chase renzi (rene russo). in the first of many errors and oddities in the movie, that injured partner is never heard from again or alluded to for the remainder of the film.de niro's best gag is his speech to a classroom of small children to open the picture about how tv cops don't act like real cops. funny thing is, as the movie progresses, his character and murphy's begin to act more and more like the clichés they supposedly clash so strongly with. in a smarter movie, de niro's diatribe could have played as ironic comment; here, it only shows to point out how truly lame the movie is. while a spoof of a reality based cop show could be funny, the team of writers and director tom dey (who made the far superior shanghai noon a few years ago; see that movie instead) seem to be on unsure footing, and instead of slamming the tv industry, they really let them off light (the harshest thing they seem to be able to say about network execs is they like to play ping pong at work). russo's character has a glint of fiendish delight in her eye, but her dialogue and actions rarely match the actress' enthusiasm. with little on screen to keep my attention, my mind began to wander, and that's dangerous in a movie with this many plot holes. for instance; if showtime (the name given to the cop show) is such a popular smash, why doesn't anyone seem to recognize de niro and murphy when they are on the job? for that matter, if their investigation of smuggler and all around mean guy vargas is being televised, why the heck hasn't someone mentioned to him that they are on his trail? then again, given this villain's actions maybe i shouldn't be surprised; this is the same joker who is very angry at an associate for using his new supergun without approval, jeopardizing a deal, and then dispatches him how? by using about ten of the superguns to level his entire house, of course! that's like putting out a fire with a bigger fire. occasionally, showtime gets laughs, but there simply aren't enough for the film's nearly two hour running time. even worse, the really smart gags suggest that this movie really could have been on to something, if only they had put in a few more drafts of the script. murphy mugs and talks as fast as he can with minimal results, and de niro looks flat out bored through most of this. after a completely unnecessary fistfight between cops and gangsters (that remarkably results in no injuries and no arrests) russo's character shouts `that's great television!' perhaps it's great television, but it's far from a great movie.

if you are going to make a movie from any book, be sure that the characters are consistant with that book. this movie not only defied the biblical story that has been told for thousands upon thousands of years to children one way or another, but it clearly took liberties that no adaptation would probably ever try. at least the lord of the rings is close enough to the books that people understand the story more if they read the books than this "noah's ark" tried to.

this is the most inaccurate and disgraceful biblical film i have ever has the misfortune to watch. i would like to know why anybody on earth could enjoy viewing this. i am so surprised that a big name like jon voight would agree to act in this disgraceful piece of garbage. many people who may not have read the bible will now be mislead by believing this film was accurate and the thought of that really bothers me. i think the makers have a lot to answer for. the worst thing is that, i believe nobody could make such obvious mistakes with a biblical film, since they can research the bible for the truth, so i believe the makers deliberately twisted what the bible says, and that is something nobody has the right to do and i find that very offensive. there are no words strong enough to describe exactly how i feel about this.

i could not believe what i saw...(once) brilliant actors appearing in this dire effort that should never of been made. the plots are dreadful and the dialogue appauling (at first i thought it was a spoof), and the acting abysmal. everything about it is bad, from the cheap sets to the phony backdrops, a bunch of paintings enlarged. respectable filmakers struggle to get their vision realised, yet this blasphemous, pathetic attempt at a mini-series makes it to our television's, with 3 oscar winners making appearances. i can only guess everyone involved somehow hurt the writer and director and were forced (maybe at gunpoint)to star in this worthless t.v. trash.

dramatic ? yes......historically accurate ? not quite !.... this movie twists the bibles details of the deluge by placing lot meeting noah during the building of the ark. fascinating time travel for lot made in part by nbc !....being lot had not been born until 2136 bce, 234 years after the floodwater's (2370bce)....thats like having george bush meet with william shakepeare ! and whats with this guy floating around selling items & nicknack's to noah ? you can make a movie based on historical facts dramatic, but don't twist it around placing people where they weren't....especially when it comes to gods word.

sorry about that. but if you have seen this "epic", you will obviously know of the utter disregard for the actual text of the bible. now, i'm not exactly the next in line for sainthood, but i do know the basics. and the basics were this. god wanted to wipe everyone of the face of the earth because he believed they have been corrupted to the point of no return. he chose noah, the diamond in the rough, and his family to be spared due to their uncorrupted ways. noah builds an ark as instructed by god to house he, his family, and two of every creature while he floods the rest of the planet. those are the basics. in this movie, you have other people roaming around the seas such as peddlers and pirates. but i thought that everyone was wiped out. i guess the executives at nbc have never been to church. there are other inaccuracies, i'm told, but being the average joe, i have no idea what they are. sorry. back to the movie, it was inaccurate, as stated before, the acting stunk, but some of the effects were good, i'll give it that. but as a whole, i've seen a better and more tasteful rendition of the story done as a little scene on the simpsons. god help the nbc executives come judgement day. 3/10

this is one of the worst mini-series i have ever seen on tv. i sat through the first half hoping it would improve but it only went from bad to worse. needless to say i could not bring myself to sit through the torture of a second nights viewing. what was jon voight thinking when he made this?????

i'll dispense with the obvious review of factual inaccuracies. they are too numerous to name. a much shorter list would be what they got right. 1. dude named noah. 2. ark with animals on it. if you want a much more accurate portrayal of noah's ark and the destruction of sodom, go rent "the bible" (1966). it depicts the story of creation through abraham attempting to sacrifice his son isaac. it's a much better movie, and it may be that the abomination called "noah's ark" (1999) drove you to seek just such a film. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060164/i really couldn't stomach watching the whole movie. from reading other comments, i can see that even the atheists found it grossly inaccurate. as a christian, it was intolerable to me. possibly the worst movie ever made. no real point to this movie either, except maybe to showcase their sub-par computer animation.was it a complete waste? maybe not. god can use evil to work good. romans 8:28 says, [28] and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god, to them who are the called according to his purpose.genesis 50 says, [20] but as for you, ye thought evil against me; but god meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.in the second example, joseph's brothers meant to kill him, but god turned their evil into a very great good. he may have done the same thing with this movie.people were so astonished by its lack of biblical foundation, that they probably broke out the dusty old bible and read the story for themselves. to find out about lot and sodom, they would have to go the whole way up to genesis 19 before god destroys sodom and gomorrah. by then, they have read almost half of genesis, so they might want to finish. the next book is exodus, which the movie "the ten commandments" was based on (and much more accurately). if they have seen that movie, then exodus becomes an easy read. so now they have read at least two whole books of the bible, just because they watched a pathetic movie about noah's ark. i'm sure this actually happened to someone out there.god works in mysterious ways.

this movie could have been an impressing epic, but the makers seem to have done their utmost to make it appear foolish. even god himself is not spared in this movie, in that his words are drenched with childish jokes. the result is blasphemous and annoying. only people who don't care to see a cheap parody on the biblical story may perhaps watch this film without embarrassment. the makers of this tasteless production should see 'il vangelo secondo matteo' (the gospel according to mathew), a film of pier paolo pasolini, who shows that it is unnecessary to pervert the words of the bible to make a good story; the most impressing result is obtained by a sincere rendering of the plain text itself.

nbc had a chance to make a powerful religious epic along the lines of "the ten commandments" and "the greatest story ever told," and instead they chose to make some halfhearted cartoon that was more like "waterworld" than anything else. i don't recall a bible passage where lot turns into a pirate and attacks the ark, nor do i remember one where noah's son develops a serious friendship with an orange, nor do i remember noah being some crazy old loon who suddenly acts like he's commanding a naval fleet and runs around shouting nautical terms like "hoist the mainstay!" this was possibly the worst marketing decision in history. obviously the majority of people watching this were going to be jewish and christian parents with their kids, so why on earth make the movie so offensive to those people? if they were intentionally trying to offend, why not advertise it that way and at least reel in the right audience?? i hope they make a real noah movie someday, one done seriously and thoughtfully, one that actually appeals to people and makes money. until then, don't waste your time with this trash.

i've spent quite a while going through all the reviews for this film. i'm in total agreement with almost every reviewer in saying that noah's ark is crap, crap, crap, crap, crap! don't the executives at nbc have any class? i feel sick to my stomach for actually watching both parts of this mini-series. the script is so dumb, so pointless, and yes, totally inaccurate! i can understand making a few changes for dramatic purposes, but this film changed just about everything in the story. god himself is going to go through the trouble to kill off the entire earth's population, but he somehow misses one guy that's sailing around trying to sell stuff to noah. give me a break! and what was up with noah's sons acting like indiana jones, saving girls in distress? if all that isn't bad enough, there's the part where god apologizes to noah and says "i'm sorry noah, i was wrong". newsflash nbc, god can not be wrong! this film is the most tasteless and disgraceful biblical film ever made.

eddy murphy and robert de niro should be a combination that results in a great comedy. great expectationa often lead to dissapointment, and this proves to be the case.when eddy as a police officer spoils a drug deal being done by detective robert, they botch it so badly that they end up doing a live action reality tv cop show. logic is not a great component of this movie. the super-gun that they spend the second half of the movie chasing down confirms it. a twelve guage machine gun that leaves large holes in sheetmetal and three will destroy a house in about a minute (without reloading) is as more a fantasy than science fiction. a five pound gun, firing hundreds of shots per minute without any recoil, is certainly the weapon of the future using the technology of the past.it is clear this movie was designed for neither adults nor children, so if you are somewhere in between, this is the movie for you.

while the new pride & prejudice film is gorgeous to view, and the soundtrack is lovely, we are not seeing jane austen's pride and prejudice. the film is for some reason set back in the early 1790's, rather than the regency period where the novel is set, as scholars have long shown. the bennets' longbourn estate is ram-shackled and looks like cold comfort farm. yet the bennets in the novel are gentry class; they own a farm, but the pig does not walk through the house, nor is the farmyard of manure and chicken droppings contiguous to the home. scenes are re-set from the novel,and lest we forget, jane austen placed scenes in certain locations for a reason. for example, the film puts the big darcy proposal scene outside in a storm in front of a neoclassical temple, as opposed to inside the collins' parsonage: why did jane austen put it in the parsonage? because while lizzy and darcy speak with total, if brutal honesty to each other in this scene, the collinses have never shared an honest word. why the rain and the outdoor proposal? it looks like jane eyre meeting rochester! and when elizabeth walks across a windy field to stand on a cliff and view the panorama, one expects her to cry, "heathcliffe" at any minute! austen has been bronteized! judy dench is a great actress, but lady catherine is supposed to be tall and striking. the petite tom hollander is a brilliant actor: but mr. collins is described in the novel as tall and heavy-looking, which suggests that his terrible dancing with poor lizzy is elephantine. matthew macfayden is another favorite of mine from mi-5 on a&e; in p&p, however, he is more the young heathcliffe, never smiling--though austen observes in the novel that darcy smiles at lizzy quite a bit, and she realizes this when she sees his wonderful smiling portrait at pemberley--a portrait that in this movie is for some reason replaced by a sculptured marble bust.and much of austen's dialogue is changed to modern speech. mr. bingley has been turned into such a clown that one wonders why darcy would have him as a friend and why jane bennet would love him. the bottom line is that while this is a great movie to watch and hear, it deviates from jane austen's novel so much that any student who watched it, thinking she could substitute viewing for reading, would fail!

minor plot spoilers ahead!!!how did such talented actors get involved in such mindless retreadeddrivel? robert deniro plays a dumb hollywood version of the standardviolence prone tough cop (i.e., he beats up the bad guys and rolls hiseyes at cops who prefer to stick by the book), and eddie murphy plays anot so tough cop who would rather be an actor (i.e., he screams out,"freeze, police!" and has his "tough look" down pat). naturally, theyare partnered when bobby's loose cannon tactics get him in hot waterwith the media and he is essentially blackmailed into starring in a"cops"-like reality show. take a breath, cuz that's as funny as itgets.no energy was put into the script - it feels like a pale retread ofevery copy buddy movie tossed into a blender with "15 minutes" starring,yes, deniro himself as, pretty much the character he is playing here. the jokes fall flat, the action feels listless, and no one seems to behaving a good time. it's dead on the screen.please don't waste your time. even if you have an overwheming affinityfor one of the actors - avoid it and do them a favor. becauze if thismakes money, these kinda of scripts will be deeemed perfectly acceptablefor actors of their quality.and to mr. deniro. you used to make serious films. i remember them -they were good. you were nominated for awards for them - remember howmuch fun that was? now after "analyze this" (which was good), "meet theparents" (which was also good), and "the adventures of rocky andbullwinkle" (which was not good), i think we need to see you parodyingyourself less, and being yourself more. "casino" feels like a long timeago. and no, i don't count "15 minutes" as serious bobby. anyone whotook that media satire seriously must get their weekly world news

there comes a time in every big name actor's career when they get sloppy and accept projects that they wouldn't have touched with a 1000 ft. pole in their golden days. remember "taxi driver"? that was a fine film. i can hardly believe that the de niro of "showtime" is the same actor.i would rather watch "time chasers" twice than see this film again. if anyone offers to take you to see "showtime" or gives you free passes, or whatever, run away as fast and far as you can.

the movie is not as funny as the director's preceding (and only other) movie, shanghai noon. showtime did have its moments, but it did not satisfy me. why it needed to be so foulmouthed, i don't know, but i give showtime **/****

with all the hype surrounding the stars of the movie, this movie left me wanting. i expected a much better movie considering the inclusion of the talents of murphy, de niro and russo but found that the movie fell flat on it's face. comedy sequences were overdone and the superior performances of the stars especially de niro and russo couldn't save this one!** out of *****

two popular actors are paired in showtime like de niro and murphy playing a police and an actor. although they share the most screen time together, they do not reach their expected performances such films like analyse this, meet the parents, dr doolittle and nutty professor. the film starts interestingly but becomes a thin, ordinary comedy which is quite disappointing.it feels like especially de niro doesn't enjoy being in showtime. thats a shame because he really shows his feelings thats what i think. unfortunately, if the idea had been used cleverly this could have been a more interesting piece of work and could be followed with a sequel like any other popular hollywood movie. well, i don't think there would be a sequel to this at least casting de niro and murpy again. ** out of *****

watching showtime i got the impression that the producers got the idea to put robert deniro and eddie murphy just for the sake of having a film that co-starred the two of them. other than that i can't think of a reason to justify the film's existence. not that it isn't amusing in spots, it certainly is, but the concept is so completely ludicrous that the laughs are somewhat muted.the thing that really got me was eddie murphy's character. i can't seem to wrap my mind around the concept of someone being a police officer as strictly a day job. when i was working person at new york state crime victims board i had to deal with all kinds of cops and they ran the gamut between the really dedicated and some real slugs, but i can't think of one who thought that this was just something i do until i get my career going in an area far afield. i mean, can you really see eddie murphy or anyone else going through the rigors of the real police academy, not the screen version, just to get a day job?anyway deniro is your basic hard working detective who's on the trail of a major gun dealer. he's undercover and murphy is part of his backup. so what does the showboating murphy do, he calls a reality based tv series like cops to film the action. so deniro's bust gets blown sky high, but the producer of the show gets some good footage of murphy and deniro and decides on a new reality based television series. so these unwilling partners get joined and try to continue working deniro's case with all the tv cameras around.eddie murphy's a funny guy, i loved him in beverly hills cop and in the doctor doolittle movies, but he's done better things than showtime and robert deniro certainly has. i guess murphy wanted a chance to work with deniro and deniro must have gotten one hefty paycheck to do this film.

i put down this vehicle from robert de niro and eddie murphy, and murphy in particular the first time but having seen it again, recently, i can see that it does have some very funny bits.this is by no means to say that this is the greatest buddy comedy of all time, but really what can you do to the already exhausted subgenre? what director, tom dey, has tried to do is make it a satire of the clichés of buddy comedy and the media. early in the movie the executive of a cable network asks: "how is this different from cops?", when chase renzi is pitching the idea of a reality show dealing with de niro's character, mitch preston (hilariously boring name by the way). that's when i saw it in a new light that i hadn't previously noticed.the idea is to show all the elements of the buddy comedy and put a twist on them. de niro's reluctance to star in the show and to partner up with murphy is right out of every cop film you can think of. you can say that de niro is actually playing himself asking: "why would i do another movie playing a cop?" chase renzi is portrayed to be a hollywood phony but if you look at her opening scene again, she is merely doing it to save her job. she somehow sees the ridiculousness of what she is doing but she wants to succeed despite that. one line says it all: "who doesn't want to be on tv?" maybe this is reading too much into what is essentially a lightweight film, merely set to entertain, but it does give it a little spin that i hadn't noticed before.as for murphy. you got to applaud him for looking this ridiculous. trey wants to be a star so bad that he is willing to sell out everything he comes in contact with. murphy was a big star and maybe it struck a nerve that it is all so fleeting.the plot with the gun is of course pretty boring. the action sequences are nothing special, except the end which required a lot of effort both from cast and crew. one thing that i noticed about the villain is that he is dressed like an 80's pop star. george michael comes to mind and that adds to the whole media spin.so, i trashed it the first time around but what the heck; if you are gonna do this, why not point out how ridiculous it really is and de niro and murphy took a big chance doing this.

i watched "deadly voyage" because david suchet was in it, after enjoying him in the "poirot" series. and joss ackland is always worth watching, so i went into the film with an expectation of it being a potentially worthwhile film. alas, it was not to be.i won't bother critiquing the performances, the pacing, the cinematography or any other structural aspect of the film; others here have already given their opinions on those elements. the only thing i want to address is the film's message, since it proclaims in the intro that it's based upon a true story, and therein hangs the film's supposed importance."deadly voyage" primarily focuses upon an impoverished black african man named kingsley who wants to move to the us, because he believes that he can make money there. nothing more, nothing less -- his motivation is utterly selfish. (of course some people will prevaricate by saying that he was doing it for his family, but in fact he decided to have children on the income he could make in ghana, so he really just created his own problem.) to that end, kingsley decides to stow-away aboard a russian freighter bound for new york. in the process of doing this, he faces harsh conditions, racist crew members and other challenges.but this is precisely where the film leaves me unsympathetic. why should the audience be expected to care about kingsley? simply because he has a goal? goals aren't such a rare commodity that his should be privileged above say, the goal of the ship's captain or the woman he left at home with his newborn child. kingsley's goal is illegal in the eyes of the us government. it is also illegal in that it steals from the russian shipping company. if he makes it to the us, it would involve taking out of a system that he has not put into. and if he gets caught, the shipping company will be fined $45,000. i doubt very much that any of the stowaways care about what their chosen course of action is costing anyone else; they're clearly just out for their own gain. he could've spent the $1,000 he won in the lottery at the beginning of the film, for legal passage to the us, and applied for residency and a work permit. instead, he takes the illegal (and dangerous) route.so since kingsley's voyage is illegal, selfish and cannot be ethically justified, why should we care about him or his ordeal? simply because he faces challenges? why should his challenges be privileged above the challenge of the russian shipping company getting to new york without stowaways? because he's black and the shipping company is white? the reason seems to be because danny glover (the film's executive producer) and others involved want us to root for kingsley, as if he's a hero on some sort of noble voyage. but once you accept that illegal immigration, theft and a fool's mission aren't noble at all, you can't really care about him.before anyone plays the race card, i assure you that i would've felt the same no matter what ethnicity/nationality the involved parties were. imagine if a british person decided to stow-away in a train headed for bhutan, sneak across the border, and collect "unwanted" buddhist antiquities, to bring back to britain to sell. how much sympathy could the challenges he faced generate? very little, i'd bet. so why should we feel different for kingley? because he's black? because he's poor by american standards? the filmmakers are banking on us sharing their views that the ends justify the means, and that a shipping company being fined $45,000 is inconsequential compared to the remote possibility of an unskilled laborer earning slightly more in the us than he could've if he had just stayed in his own home country. i didn't buy it for a minute.

hilariously inept - like "she wore a yellow ribbon" remade by five-year-olds.spoilers ahead: despite its title, and the high bodycount, "slaughter trail" is in fact a musical with injun battles instead of dance numbers.if you ever wondered what ed wood might have done with a b-movie budget, this film should answer your question. some decisions may have been bad only in retrospect, such as filming in the short-lived cinecolor process, which resulted in faces changing hue within the same shot. but there was definitely some ill-advised skimping on the film's main set, a cavalry fort that seems to be partly a norman castle.terry gilkyson, who later wrote the 'the bare necessities' for disney's "the jungle book", supplies a score full of original ditties which would have been wonderful for a cartoon but which fit western action like a fuzzy slipper stuck in a stirrup. one song tells how "horse hooves pound, and their melody sounds, like the hoofbeat serenade"...during a dead-serious scene of a cavalry patrol. other songs literally narrate the story shot by shot, introducing characters, describing their moods and gestures - as they happen on screen - and even stop to advertise the cinecolor process(!) the script sends ferocious navajos on the warpath to avenge the killing of two of their band by an outlaw trio. by the end of the film, what looks like a hundred navajos and cavalrymen have bitten the dust (thanks to repeated footage of the same characters dying over and over.) but the chief is satisfied once he sees the trio of badguys have been slain. as the singer helpfully informs those of us who weren't paying attention, the navajos ride away, their battle called off. the cavalry captain, surrounded by the corpses of his fallen comrades, cheerily waves his appreciation.the direction could most charitably be described as wooden, or more to the point, wood-en. navajos are consistently shot off their horses in pairs -- never just one. virtually every red man on foot dies by throwing his hands in the air and keeling over. the film also employs the most cautious stuntmen in hollywood, who crouch before dropping off a one-story roof (and still fail to stick the landing) or turn to look behind them as they slide, "dead", down a rocky slope.the star is brian donlevy, who surely deserves an oscar for not blushing. after the endless final battle scene -- "climax" is scarcely the word -- he scans a list of the dozens of his troopers killed, and shrugs, "it could've been a lot worse." trooper andy devine gets to sing and robber/murderer gig young laughs at andy's antics...which leads a character who had been held up by masked bandits to rat gig out: "i'd know that laugh anywhere!" and lest anyone forget just what a nasty piece of work howard hughes could be, recall that as head of rko, hughes was first in line to blacklist original star howard da silva when huac denounced him. it would take hughes another six years to finish running that once-celebrated studio into the ground, but it didn't help things when he insisted on reshooting da silva's every scene for this film, substituting donlevy.it was nearly a decade before da silva was able to work in hollywood again. but all things considered, for getting him out of "slaughter trail", he should have sent hughes a thank-you note.

anyone who knows anything about evolution wouldn't even need to see the film to say "fake". "it's never been disproved" also is a weak argument. saying the universe was created by a giant hippo cannot be disproved. although, to be fair, it does seem like the only people who do believe are the same people who open email attachments from people they don't know or give their bank details to a dude in zambia. no bones of any primates are have been found in the united states or canada. there is also a good reason why legitimate scientists don't bother studying this. the same argument goes for the loch ness monster, ghosts and god.

i saw this movie years about 8 years ago when it first came out, and the only memories that i have about it are : 1. that it was awful. 2. that in one scene linnea quigley applies suntan lotion to her arms and legs repeatedly for about 15 minutes straight (it seemed that long anyways). 3. one scene where a character gets a sledgehammer rammed into his head. in this scene, when the hammer connects, the head smashes like glass. it's quite bad.

"stick around" is one of the brief series of films that paired bobby ray with oliver 'babe' hardy before hardy's immortal teaming with stan laurel. several critics have suggested that ray and hardy -- the gormless little man and the overbearing big man -- were a prototype for laurel and hardy, but that simply isn't true. ray and hardy play off each other well, but really aren't a team; in each of these films, ray has more footage and is clearly meant to be the hero, while hardy bullies him in a manner very much unlike his later "ollie" character's treatment of "stanley". it's very clear that the relationship between little bobby and big babe was inspired by earlier chaplin films, in which the little tramp was bullied by huge mack swain or burly eric campbell.however, in "stick around", hardy sports a bowler hat that's identical to his later "ollie" titfer (although with a fuller moustache), and he and bobby -- after spending most of this movie as adversaries -- end up as drunken comrades.bobby is a paperhanger for the firm of matz and blatz, with hardy as his boss. when the tardy bobby tries to pretend he showed up promptly, there's some clever physical business between the two men that reminds me of a routine performed by roscoe arbuckle and buster keaton in 'the garage'. a bit later, bobby ray -- whose brief acting career never firmly developed a screen persona -- performs an "impossible" gag that would have been inappropriate for stan laurel, when he pulls a long stepladder out of a much smaller toolkit.the paperhangers go to work in a sanitarium, and there are the usual unrealistic depictions of mental illness: one resident insists on sitting on a piece of toast because he thinks he's a poached egg! there are also some howlingly racist (and tastelessly unfunny) gags involving a black man who obligingly lets the inmates crack open walnuts on top of his head. when he sees a *picture* of a lion -- not even a photograph, mind you -- he goes all cowardly as if it were an actual wild animal."stick around" is fairly dire. most of the pantomime and acting is much broader than it needs to be for a slapstick comedy; even hardy, already a very subtle actor by 1925, pongs badly with his over-acting here. there are several bad examples of shot-matching. i was impressed with one unusual camera set-up, when a fat pedestrian's face is dirtied and we see a close-up of his reflection in a hand mirror, rather than his actual face.spoilers coming. during their brief pairing, hardy typically played ray's boss or adversary or both; here, for once, they end up as pals. it's a nice ending, but it doesn't make up for what's really a poor film. my rating for this one is only 4 out of 10.

this film is terrible. not only is the story unbelievable, the situations the characters put themselves in are so silly, to the point where it isn't shocking. i find it sad that daisy eagan, star of broadway's the secret garden, decided that this would be a career step. the idea is interesting, two young girls coming of age very quickly. but the sex isn't even arousing. the film is silly, the story is silly, the performances are silly, and the whole concept while interesting falls flat. i'm sure all 14 year old girls make out with guys after they've had their first period and tried to flush their panties down the toilet. better luck next time guys. my scale * t-scale *

if this movie had been directed by a man, he would have been jailed. while adrian lyne was shackled with a lawyer in the editing room to oversee the gutting of a classic piece of literature to appease the censors, and to avoid running afoul of the child pornography protection act of 1996, a woman dumps ripe on us and everyone applauds. did i miss a meeting? in addition to the blatant pedophilia, this movie is utterly preposterous. has this woman never set foot on an active military base? has she never met a soldier? whose army is this? the uniforms must have come from uniforms-r-us. just throw on some patches, who cares? just make sure each and every one of them has a big red one. there is a slight inside joke here that no doubt went over the auteur's head, but might possibly have been slipped in by whoever furnished the military vehicles. certainly there were no military advisors. the u.s. army does not operate slums. temporary base camps in jungle war zones are cleaner than this. the u.s. army does not put 14-year-old girls to work on military bases, nor allow them to use the firing ranges or training courses. there is much drama to be mined in the sexual coming-of-age of teenage girls. this movie has absolutely nothing to do with that whatsoever.

uninspired, pretty much all around. the only exceptions were a couple emotional scenes with keena (violet), with whose performance i was pleasantly surprised and occasionally moved. beyond that, it ended up being little more than a bad coa flick.

"ripe" is one of those awful indies which manages to get into circulation and give indies a bad name. telling a stupidly incongruous tale of pubescent twin sisters who crawl from a firey car crash which kills their parents and then hit the road while happily shoplifting, making goo-goo eyes at some guy, and ending up on an army post so dilapidated no army would want it (yeah, right!). an apparent attempt at a coming of age flick, "ripe" is an almost complete loser which wanders aimlessly as the players drift in and out of character finally ending clumsily with nary a shred of credibility to be found anywhere. not recommended for anyone.

this movie was, in one word, terrible. it was boring, predictable, and downright creepy. i kept waiting for it to end and when it did, i was horrified. the ending left a bad taste in my mouth, to say the least. my advice to anyone interested in movies about budding female sexuality: stay away from this movie. movies like this give classics like lolita a bad name.

this movie did attempt to capture the naive idealism that many young teenaged girls have for fun, friendship, escape, danger, sex, maturity, etc. the problem was that it failed to establish these things on every single level; which is why it failed to build a decent story around them. i couldn't follow the point of any part of this story, nor any reason why i should care.this movie is not an exploration into pedophilia at all. it's basically about a girl being in love with her sister, and her sister being in love with the idea of "men". while the latter tries out her love of men, the former tries to win her sister back by "getting even".the plot is weak, the characters are weak, and the reality of it all was similar to an amateur porn filmmaker (without the sexual substance).

thinly-cloaked retelling of the garden-of-eden story -- nothing new, nothing shocking, although i feel that that is what the filmmakers were going for. the idea is trite. strong performance from daisy eagan, that's about it. i believed she was 13, and i was interested in her character. the rest left me cold.

there are so many things wrong with this movie i don't even know where to begin. the story is not cohesive at all. i guarantee that five minutes into the movie the average viewer will be scratching his/her head in confusion.here's what i remember of the movie before i was bored into unconsciousness: a quasi-abusive dad chases some pre-teen sisters through a house but turns out to be not that abusive after all. in the next scene, the girls are about 15. they're driving with their parents and hit a deer. the deer must have been explosive because their car blows up, one sister drags the other from the burning wreckage. then, the girls are drifting in a boat on a lake and make a huge plan to go to kentucky (??) and start a new life. in the very next scene, the girls are hitchhiking toward a military base. and what a military base it is. actually, it's more like a hog farm converted to look like a military base with plenty of confused extras playing "soldiers." the base commander's office is particularly awesome because there are random things like an ak-47 hanging on the wall and a drill sergeant hat mounted to a plaque (????) so the audience is sure to know that this is a military guy's office. then some random dude pushing a motorcycle shows up and the base commander orders him to go "into town" to buy some porn mags, and to make sure the soldiers don't think that he's on the "pink team." so our character takes a pickup converted to look like an army truck "to town" and loads up a box from a nondescript "book store" with a blowup doll by the front door. the girls hide in the guy's truck when he stops to gas up, and look through the porn stash to find items inside like the "anal invader." i guess that's enough of the plot to scare most people away. plot aside, the sound quality is terrible and the movie is full of cheesy attempts at symbolism, like a radio preacher talking about forbidden fruit during the scene where the "slutty" sister meets the main character for the first time, or how the camera lingers way too long on certain shots to try to convey a "message".if you ever see this for sale or rent or whatever, stay away. it's not worth the money in either case.

this is one of a rarity of movies, where instead of a bowl of popcorn one should watch it with a bottle of vodka. to be completely honest we are a group of people who actually know the man, mo ogrodnik, and decided to drink ourselves stupid to this film.the cinematic aspect of wolfgang something's photography seems to have left out both close-ups and breasts. mo and wolfgang's collaborative effort revealed the passion of the two actresses, plastic peens holding passion. there's also beetle banging. as violet would have put it: "this (plastic peen) goes up your butt". the rat porn and subsequent rat smashing is awesome. alright. so if you are still reading, let us explain who we are. mo ogrodnik teaches at nyu and we are a group of her students, who, finishing a film class with her, decided to get poop- faced and watch here directorial debut. she also wrote uptown girls. i can't tell you how much that's been hammered into our skulls. so this movie is quite the experience. at the very bottom of this post will be a drinking game we created for this movie. about 13 minutes into this game, none of us could see straight. the sheer amount of dido's in the first thirty minutes created enough reasons to drink to pacify an elephant.there was something secretly pleasurable about seeing two underage girls hit on a kurt cobain lookalike with absolutely no context, save for his mysterious scene at the convenience store where he was oh-so-naturally reading a local newspaper. because that's what we all do. the heart-shaped glasses were delightfully derivative of lolita. and something about that provocative scene of the nude chin-up boy suggests the director's history of homosexual pornographic experiments. we wish we were kidding.enough intellectual contemplation. on to the drinking game! this will ensure that the viewing experience is a positive one. it's very simple, and very likely to send at least one member of your party to immediate care.the mo ogrodnik/ripe drinking game: 1. every time you see anything related to pornography, take a drink. 2. every time you see auteur mo ogrodnik's name appear, take a drink. 3. sex. 4. (plastic peen) require two drinks. 5. any time somebody points a gun at another character, take a drink. -at this point you will probably need to refill/pee pee any remaining sobriety from your body.- 6. any time there is blood (including "lady blood"), please take a sip! 7. the underused hula-hoop girl requires one drink per second. 8. gratuitous use of the "magic black man" requires one drink. 9. if you can't figure out the through-line, keep drinking, beyotch. 10. whenever you are able to predict a line, take a drink. trust us. it's easy. that's it, internet! keep drinking, and try not to get riped.-hawaiian smirnoff punch, jr.

ah, the classic genre of 80s sex comedies. this is set on two beaches; one a nude beach featuring myriad (fully) unclothed women. the plot? something about a bunch of dimwits attempting to get laid. the usual. fans of gratuitous t&a (and p) should hunt this one down.

the tv show was slow moving and the 'offbeat' characters were sometimes irritating. only through the miracle of fast forward was i able to make it through the first 2 hours. the write-up indicates that it's some kind of comedy/mystery but i didn't see much of either. if it really picks up after the first 2 hours, please let me know, because i doubt that i will watch the rest without a recommendation.this review is supposed to be without spoilers so i will continue in a vague, non-spoiler, fashion. i found the two main characters uninteresting and unsympathetic. i found myself asking 'would a normal adult do that?' the man with the hedge trimmer looking out the window was irritating and when the male lead interacted with him, he looked pathetic. would a normal adult put up with someone as irritating as him?

now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda. it came no wonder for me that this is admired by most american viewers and hated by europeans. this show is made for americans - it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere. almost everyone involved must be return to school, acting is utterly predictable and bad, script is pile of garbage all round. operator work is ground zero etc. etc.you have been warned. it doesn't even have "guilty pleasure" entertainment for those brainwashed iq=0 human beings.i wish i could enter negative values, admins? anyone?

i thought this series was going to be another fun, action series with some dynamic plots and great performances. i was wrong. while i like jamie denton, this show is hardly worth watching at all, unless you enjoy watching some people brutalized and the actions of the agents supposedly warranted under the theme of "national security." the show is great propaganda for the current government, and spews out jingoism as though we talk that way every day. after a couple of episodes, it was boring the hell out of me, and i started watching reruns of house invaders on bbcamerica instead. rather watch csi and without a trace, without a doubt.

in watching enterprise for the first time, as we all no doubt do with all shows, i went into it with an open mind, enjoying about half of the past star trek efforts and disliking the other half.enterprise has fallen short, but this episode "a night in sickbay" made me seriously question why i bother tivoing the shows from monday night on sci fi.masking some idea that it is one of those 'a day in the life' episodes, in which we learn about what makes certain characters operate as humanoids, the writers seemed to forget that this was supposed to be a starship vessel, not the ricardoes and the mertzes.a planet, especially one whose people had been offended previously by the enterprise crew (for eating in public), was no place for a dog. as an animal lover myself, i would have never taken one of my pets into an environment that had proved in the past to be tense.but what made this episode even more ridiculous was the endless problem with all of these st shows, constantly depicting things that are sacred and insulting to other cultures, as tho they are offering some insight into american religious zealots.the aliens were now offended when the dog urinated on a sacred tree, yet the aliens were quite capable of taking the dog urinating as an insult.strange how the dog's urinating wasn't regarded as some form of worship. i wonder how that one got by the show's writers.from there, we are subjected to a captain who was misguided by his duties. in watching the episode, i found it very easy to forget that bakula was supposed to be the ship's captain.he chose to sleep in sickbay and from there we are given more inanities of behavior (sigh) that we aren't supposed to understand and that causes us to furrow brows.the doctor non-chalantly clips long, hairy toenails and feeds them to hungry caged animals. ewwwwww! then a white bat creature escapes.oh, how is anyone supposed to sleep with all of this going on! toenail clipping, for crying out loud! i was waiting for something that feeds on vomit to be presented.then we were inexplicably given some idea that the captain was in love with t'pol, and that perhaps he was masking those feelings with his concern over the dog.endless amounts of rubbish."your dog is ill, so go have sex. you'll feel better." and of course, the captain had to apologize and we humans had to regard his apology as completely ridiculous, because we are so (everyone smile very sarcastically) narrow-minded! saw depictions such as this endlessly droned out on tng.oddly enough, the only thing missing from this awful episode was that trip person offering his smirks and downhome boyisms, tho bakula seemed to be covering all of that with the silly dog.oh, the dog survived, so now go play fetch.

this episode sucks.over the past few years i have watched all episodes of "next generation" and "voyager" and am now watching "enterprise".i am thoroughly enjoying this series. until this episode. i stared at the screen in horror at the destruction of character and entertainment. it is more like an attempt at slapstick.it does not build the characters but throws them out on a limb - and leaves the audience gasping. it does little to build the series.why this was ever allowed to go to air amazes me. was it the writing? was it the directing? was it the producer? we'll probably never know.but one bad apple isn't bad i suppose. i say that hoping it is only one.

kasparov vs. deep blue is no doubt a fascinating story, but i don't think you'd know it by watching this movie. i think it focuses too much on the conspiracy theory that ibm cheated...and what does this theory hinge upon? the idea that at one point the computer made a move that "looked human". i am not a chess grandmaster or a computer scientist. and while i don't doubt that the move looked human, to me it doesn't seem beyond the realm of possibility that the most powerful chess-playing computer ever created could make a surprising move...or that such a machine could beat even a genius like kasparov. the movie gets way too much mileage out of this theory, and not enough out of the personalities of the people involved...that could have made it a much more interesting story. the direction also relies way too much on the conceits of a pointlessly whispered narration, and the imagery of an 18th century chess-playing machine that looks like one of those animatronic gypsy fortunetellers you see at the carnival. also the story was slowed down by many empty shots of kasparov revisiting "the scene of the crime". i don't doubt that kasparov and the chess community found ibm's behavior vexing, but i don't think it's any different than you would find from any other big corporation. at the end of the movie, you are left with the feeling that kasparov is a huge crybaby and the deep blue programmers are either victims or cheats. i think if the filmmaker wanted the viewer to believe the conspiracy theory (which he almost certainly did), he should have presented a lot more evidence. in fact, more evidence would have been a good idea in the first place. the whole thing left me with a sour taste in my mouth.

this documentary was neither professionally nor objectively made. the whole thing played out like a conspiracy theory by ibm to win the match in question just to make some money. garry kasparov has an ego problem. he was puffed up before the match and when he lost, he didn't like it. i remember playing chess against computers back in the 80s and it wasn't too difficult to win. as time went on, i started to lose and didn't like it. today, i simply don't play against computers anymore because they're just too good. not only that, the games are uninteresting and lack the appeal of human games, where both sides are more likely to err and open the game to exciting possibilities. this documentary keeps showing us images of the turk which is an ancient chess playing automaton that was really controlled by a human being. from the start until the end we are lead to believe that ibm short of literally hid a human gm in the back of their cupboard-sized computer. i'm a computer scientist and take offense at the notion that just because garry lost, ibm must have cheated. i know how computers play chess. it's not magic and it's no mystery. they can be trained, have huge amounts of chess knowledge and they most certainly see positions and possibilities in unprecedented detail compared to humans. it's really no surprise that deep blue won. perhaps at the time it was. if it happened today, given the ever-increasing processing power of machines; people would hardly blink. if a machine couldn't at least draw with a gm today, people would think the program was weak.

being an admitted chess addict, i was excited to see a documentary about the 1997 rematch between garry kasparov and ibm's deep blue supercomputer. i was hoping to see an in depth look at the match and a lot of what kasparov had to say. boy was i wrong and misguided by a mile. this documentary is a lot like many modern documentaries - there is a lot of flash but no real substance. after watching it, i am sad to say, i felt like i wasted my time. one of the most annoying aspects about the documentary is that it does not stay at one place for a decent period of time. it has the typical mtv type editing, where the camera shows different images and quick sound bites from people every five seconds. it is very sad that film-making has been watered down to the attention span of a 10-year old child.i understand it is difficult to make a film about chess, but that does not mean one should make it flashy. 'game over' did have a couple of interesting ideas though. it brought up the idea whether computers can think like human beings or not; whether computers have advanced to a unique new level. this is what kasparov thought after the match, but this film does not go deep enough with this idea. also, this film tries to bring in a bizarre theory. it tries to imply the paranoid that a human being was making the moves along with the help of the computer. kasparov had suspicions about this, but still to this day there is no evidence. towards the end of the film, it tries to imply the bizarre that maybe anatoly karpov might have been the human being who was secretly making the moves with the aid of deep blue. interesting to think about, but i don't know how plausible or realistic it is. i still would not recommend this movie though, not even for chess addicts.

i was disappointed in this documentary.i thought it would be about the second chess match between grandmaster garry kasporov and deep blue the supercomputer designed by ibm computer experts to beat any human chess player.kasparov was and still is,considered the greatest chess player ever.the movie takes us back to 1997 where kasporov had agreed to have a rematch with "deep blue" after defeating it 1 year earlier.but instead of focusing on the game,it focuses more on what happens before and after.there are snippets of the game,but not very many.much of the film centers around kasporov's paranoid obsession that the match was rigged as part of some conspiracy theory and that he lost the match unfairly.the movie also includes interviews with people who are not interesting in any way.they even chat with the manager of the building where the match took place.who cares?i also found it very dry and slow.ultimately this movie was unsatisfying.this is just my opinion,of course.if you like conspiracy theories,this movie might interest you.for people not into chess or conspiracy theories,this movie would probably have no value.i am a chess fan,and i only stuck it out because of that.i give"game over:kasparov and the machine" 4/10

what game over: kasparov and the machine does best is to delve into garry kasparov's psyche during the 1997 competition against ibm's deep blue. you see him becoming more and more paranoid, and increasingly unravelled, all because in the second game, deep blue made a move that seemed too human for his preconceived notion of chess computers. kasparov thought then, and still does, that ibm cheated.game over tries to seem unbiased, but it is clear that the director thinks that ibm cheated. however, they give no real evidence to support the cheating claim, only intimations that ibm's security surrounding the computer room was because ibm really had grandmasters hidden in there overriding the computer on certain key occasions, and kasparov's assertion that the computer didn't play like a computer usually does at one point in game two. in game two, kasparov played a game that was designed to trick the computer, attempting to sacrifice a pawn in a situation where previous computer chess programs would have taken the pawn, leading to the computer's eventual loss. deep blue didn't take the bait, and kasparov was so rattled because the computer seemed to play like a human that he didn't even see that he could have played deep blue to a draw and ended up resigning. that game psyched him out so much that he was unable to recover, and after playing games 3,4, and 5 to draws, lost game 6 horribly.the question of whether ibm cheated all comes down to that single move in game two, where the deep blue made the move that any human would make but that had, up to that point, tripped up computers. joel benjamin, a chess grandmaster on ibm's programming team explained in the documentary that they knew that chess computers always got tripped up in that situation, and consequently spent a lot of time and effort programming deep blue so that it wouldn't make the mistake that other computers do. if you believe benjamin's assertion, then the case is clear, ibm did not cheat. unfortunately, the director quickly moved on and never mentioned ibm's explanation for the rest of the movie, preferring to cut between shots of the chess playing hoax of the 19th century, the turk, and shots of deep blue, hinting that deep blue was really controlled by a human as well. as someone who has an understanding of programming, the explanation by ibm makes perfect sense--if you knew what you were doing, it would not be terribly difficult to put something in the code so that, if thus and so conditions are reached, then do thus and so--in other words, tell the computer what to do if a situation like the one that kasparov created in game 2 ever happened. this isn't cheating, it's doing a good job of programming a chess computer.in the end, it's eminently clear that the director thinks that ibm cheated, and the repeated comments about ibm's stock rising 15% the day that deep blue won suggest the idea that ibm cheated to pump its stock price (kasparov even compares ibm and deep blue to enron). however, there is plenty of outside opinion, within both the chess and computer science communities, that deep blue won fair and square and that kasparov lost because he simply couldn't get past his view of computers as "dumb machines" and got psyched out by a machine that didn't seem so dumb after all. i just wish that the director had let us see the alternative opinion.

i'm writing this note as a chess player as well as as a movie viewer. i watched the 1997 kasparov-deep blue games on the internet. i know something about the issues that were raised. other chess players will come along and want to know whether this movie is worth seeing/buying, and i'm talking largely to them. however, i'll try not to ignore those who aren't "into chess".this movie is about the 1997 match between garry kasparov and the custom-built computer "deep blue". however, the first image you see in the movie is not of kasparov, or of the computer, but of "the turk". this is an "automaton" which was built in europe at the turn of the 18th-19th century and played winning chess against all comers. i put the word "automaton" in quotes because it was, as everyone now knows, a fake. there was a man inside it.if you don't like seeing "the turk", then you won't be able to stand the movie, because "the turk" has as much screen time as kasparov, maybe more, both in modern footage and in b/w footage from some old movie. the reappearance of "the turk" every few seconds underscores kasparov's charge that "deep blue" had human assistance - that it was (to some degree) a fake computer, that ibm cheated, that there was "a man inside it" working behind the scenes to help it win. not only does kasparov believe this, but the filmmakers seem to believe it too. and so this is not really much of a movie about chess games or about programming chess computers. it is a propaganda piece about a big corporation supposedly misusing a helpless grandmaster. really it is a lot like a "negative campaign ad", as it is chock full of ominous music and evocative camera work and spooky sound effects and innuendos ("we never found out what was behind that locked door") and the ever-present "turk".now, most people in the chess community are pretty much convinced that ibm did not cheat and that this was garry's paranoia at work. to start with, in order for a human to help "deep blue" beat kasparov, it would seem that you would need a human who was better than "deep blue" and better than kasparov. since there was no such person, the whole idea is a bit suspect from the start. furthermore, by the time this movie was made, there were computer programs that could run on your pc that could beat strong grandmasters. today, much more than in 1997, we take it for granted that a computer can do things you might not expect. and we are less likely to take it as a monumental human tragedy that a computer beat a guy in chess. (and in fact, the bottom line is that kasparov beat himself with two bad mistakes, including resigning game 2 in a drawn position.) as for the chess games, you actually see very little of them. there are a few comments from masters and commentators that tell briefly how they went, but really you don't get to see hardly any of the strategy or tactics at all. naturally as a chess player i take this as a major shortcoming, but i think that non-players are being cheated too. imagine a baseball movie, for example, where you don't hardly get to see any of the game - just a commentator telling you that "in game four, the white sox defeated the astros with such and such a score." nobody would make a movie like that. but here, for example, we are told that kasparov made a bad blunder in the opening of the decisive game 6, but we aren't shown the position on the screen, or told why it was a blunder, or what he should have done instead, or anything. we just see a few seconds of kasparov holding his head in his hands, and then more atmospheric sound effects and camera work.(since i saw this on dvd, let me warn chess players about the dvd as well. the jacket promises you that the extras include the games "with analysis". is this grandmaster analysis, which people like us might find interesting? no! it is the automated computer voice synthesizer analysis from some version of chessmaster, that tells you when a piece is attacked and a pawn gets isolated and that you are in the "caro-kann defense, main line". blahhhh.) someone might then come along and say, "well, clearly this movie is meant to dramatize the match for the non-player, and so it's unfair to be impatient with it." but actually it doesn't do a very good job of reaching out to the non-player either - it skates over some points that a true novice would really want to have explained. for example it says that kasparov could have gotten "perpetual check" in the second game, but it doesn't explain what that is (or show what it would have looked like on the board, which would have been interesting). it flashes back to the kasparov-karpov matches but doesn't explain why there were two of them or who organized them etc. i didn't need this information myself, but i'm familiar with it. if you don't already have chess experience, there are places where you are going to be confused, and this is just a defect in the film.ultimately i can't recommend the movie, which, like "the turk" itself, is not what it purports to be (a documentary) but more of a stage illusion.

i am a chess player and i wanted to like this film. trouble is, the content could have been fitted in a 30-minute documentary.there were lots of shots of corridors being walked down and kasparov gazing out in the hall where he won the world championship. there were other shots of kasparov being walked round the site of the 1997 match and being told where he sat and where deep blue was located. this just looked like filler.also, i didn't find it interesting to see in detail where deep blue was now and seeing an ibm techie trying, unsuccessfully to 'open' it. what would we have seen of interest inside anyway - a little grandmaster?also, the recent match against karpov. i no longer follow professional chess enough to know when and where this was. it would have been nice to have been told: was this a one-off 'just for the money'? was it part of the world championship cycle? what was the final score? the nub of the film was the play in game two. could/would ibm let kasparov see 'inside' the machine? that's where the focus should have been.

as long as you keep in mind that the production of this movie was a copyright ploy, and not intended as a serious release, it is actually surprising how not absolutely horrible it is. i even liked the theme music.and if ever a flick cried out for a treatment by joel (or mike) and the mst3k bots, this is it! watch this with a bunch of smart-ass wise-crackers, and you're in for a good time. have a brew, butter up some large pretzels, and enjoy.of course, obtaining a copy requires buying a bootleg or downloading it as shareware, but if you're here on the imdb, then you're most likely savvy enough to do so. good luck.and look for my favorite part....where dr. doom informs the ff that they have 12 hours to comply with his wishes....and he actually gestures the number "12" with his finger while doing so....it's like "evil sesame street"....hoo boy....and of course mrs. storm declaring "just look at you....the fanstastic four" is just so heartwarming....you'll laugh, you'll cry.....so if you love schlocky sci-fi, this one's fantastic for you!

yes! this movie was just bad in every way in things like cast,effects,boredom,excitement,and of course,being fantastic and we all know the four heroes in this one were a bit more colourful compared to the new ones but it still has to go,a fantastic bore like this really was just silly trash which i knew nobody would like when i saw it,i mean surely with that budget about 3 or 4 good movies could have been made but no. i am just glad that the new version made this year totally showed everyone how the fantastic four should have been made with good story,great cast like jessica alba one of my favourite actresses otherwise it would have been totally forgotten but thankfully no. the new one was excellent when i saw it with my mates at the cinema but this old fantastic bore has gotta go.

drifting around on bootlegs, sometimes thought an urban comic book legend, the first ff movie is pretty much as bad as everyone fears. i guess marvel comics now pretends it doesn't exist, what with the 2005 version out in theaters earlier this year. but it's out there, a reminder and the last of the first wave of bad, low budget marvel super-hero adaptations (captain america, punisher, most of the tv movies). 'low budget' is too easy a description for this ff pic. due to basically no funds, showing the powers of the super foursome was limited to very quick shots (mr.fantastic), quasi-animation (torch), and fades (invisible girl-the easiest to do). the thing suit was not bad and probably half the budget; the face part was especially almost convincing. the acting? alex hyde-white as reed is pretty good; the other 3 are ok, tho jay as johnny acts like a spaz at times to sort of show off his 'fiery' temper. the dialog is comic-book style, and it's the supporting cast which ends up floundering trying to make it work. dr.doom is way over melodramatic and unintentionally comical, and his two main henchmen are a case study of how not to act or write dialog.the plot? not too good. it was quite faithful to the origin story of the ff (more so than the later big budget version), and even though the non-budget, again, restricted showing, for example, the actual crash landing, it kept the essential ingredients of how they discovered their powers in an isolated area - it's the best part of the picture, tho you have to wait a full half-hour for it. i also found the music odd in places; when the 4 are bathed in those cosmic rays, a kind of church choir is heard, as if it's a religious experience. the rest of it, however, is hopeless. even with no budget, the story could have done without the jeweler character (resembling the mole man villain of the books); it spends way too much time with him and his underground gang, as well as the blind alicia. these sections are a waste of celluloid and very boring. the climactic struggle with doom & his men starts fine, but degenerates into an awful mess as the torch races a laser beam (cool animation but belonging in a cartoon). fans can have a laugh at the bad ff fx and witless storyline, if they don't get depressed & outraged first.

this is truly awful, the feeblest attempt at a comics adaptation ever committed to film. every possible thing about this movie that could be bad, is. music, acting, lighting, sets, "special" effects... about the only positives i can find are that sue looks cute in her blue tights and that the thing make-up is almost passable (face only). that's it. zip. don't bother tracking down that bootleg copy; it's really not worth your time. even the aborted "captain america" movie from the early 90's is far less excruciating than squirming in your seat while you try to endure this mess.

without a doubt this is the worse comicbook movie every made. period!! yes, it's worse then dolph lundgren's (1989) punisher. yup.. worse then the 1979 & 1991 captain america movies. oh yeah, it's even worse then christopher reed scripted superman iv: quest for peace movie. sheeshh.. that movie was so bad that the guy who played nuclear man only starred in one other film and it was only on t.v. =opthis movie is "d" quality. i had a chance to watch it on the scifi channel back in 1997. i had heard it was pretty bad, but had nothing else to do that night so i figured i check it out. what a waste of an hour and a half. i would have been better off watching reruns of different strokes. besides having the lamest special effects and worse acting i've ever seen, the whole script was just awful and not well directed at all. thankfully a new fantastic four movie is being done and hopefully this version will do the heroes justice. i was hoping for a new spawn movie in the future, but it has yet to materialize. do not rent this movie. if you happen to see it being televised on cable, check it out. be warned though, you'll most like be flipping the channel after the first 15 mins.

i have always loved bad creations, rhetorical criticism and my film professor validated that for me in college. this is not as bad as the star wars holiday special, there is nothing bottom of the lunchbox than that mistake. this the fantastic four film, complete with the i-have-no-idea-why-hes-excessively-tweaking-his-fingers doctor doom, is high on the list of colossal mistakes. doom's dialogue "kill him!...let him go!" is classic as it is staggering in its hilarity. the editing is good, and the director of photography isn't half-bad...those are the up-sides. i cannot, however, subject all my friends to watch in its entirety, but if i can get the chance i show them the "can jonny and sue come to outer space with us!" scene i do. i also include the final scene scene, where redd richards in his ff outfit for some reason, alongside his bride sue in her wedding dress, get into the limo...the payoff is the extendo arm in farewell as they drive away. most people are in complete disbelief that something like this exists.

this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life .period.this movie goes beyond ridiculous,it is like the director wants to get his ass sued by the actors for wrongfully misrepresenting their roles as the fantastic four,i believe the movie should have been released in comic book stores in order for the only how u should say it,desperate geeks who cant get enough cheesiness and want to see more and more crap movies.in conclusion to my paradox statements and thesis,i do believe this movie has had great disadvantages to the futures of the cast's contributors,with the exception of jay underwood's character,in which i do believe it was his best performance,considering roles such as the not quite human movies in which the story is told in a way that he has no character.he cant act,and people have made good decisions to not go see his movies,this is why he is most likely not going to be any huge roles,unless he sparks his career in a most rare,but interesting way.

whether or not this adaptation of the marvel comic was made  and shelved  so its production company could retain the copyright to the characters, it doesn't change the fact that it's utter rubbish. the dr. doom and (especially) thing costumes are surprisingly good, but everything else suffers from a deficit of either cash or talent. director oley sassone can't even point a camera at stuff without including such howlers as a blind woman's pov, the dialogue is absolutely dismal, the team's costumes don't fit properly, and the effects are appalling: the human torch seems to be drawn onto the film with felt tip pens, while mr. fantastic's powers are brought to life using a bendy blue stick with a glove on the end. joseph culp compensates for having to wear a mask by wildly waving his arms about, jay underwood is incredibly annoying, the rest of the cast hit various levels of terrible, and while it's hard not to feel sorry for all these guys who thought this movie would get a release, it's equally difficult to imagine any of them believing it was actually any good.

admittedly, when the chance to see this horribly infamous legend of a movie, my expectations were pretty low. they weren't low enough. scholckmaster roger corman somehow came into ownership of the rights to produce the marvel comic book characters sometime in the late 80's or early 90's, and handed it off to oley sassone, whose directorial work has largely been in campy tv series such as 'hercules' and 'viper'. with a supposed total budget of 1.5 million dollars, it was produced, shot and briefly released on video and then sent to the wasteland of forgotten film. there it should have remained. however, like a banana peel in a vaudeville act, this "fantastic four" sits out in the ether waiting to cause a pratfall for those rare people unlucky and foolish enough to step on it. if you have ever heard of these comic book characters, you know what to expect. the people who made this were very true to the source material, and that is the only thing for which they deserve any credit in this fiasco. this presents the origins of the heroic group that develop superhuman powers when the shielding on their experimental spacecraft fails to protect them from cosmic radiation. reed richards (alex hyde-white) develops the ability to stretch his body and becomes 'mr. fantastic'. his girlfriend, sue storm (rebecca staab) can become invisible, and her brother, johnny (jay underwood) can spontaneously cause fire to erupt from his body. finally, ben grimm ('credited' to both michael bailey-smith and carl ciafarlio) receives superhuman strength when his skin mutates to a rock-like hyde and is then referred to as the thing. there is a prologue that sets up a former classmate of reed's, victor von doom (joseph culp) to become their enemy, dr. doom, who orchestrates the sabotage of the fantastic four's space flight as an act of revenge for injuries he blames on reed. there is the set-up, then the discovery of the powers, the revelation of the villain and ultimately a climactic fight. there are more details to the poorly-written script, but they are negligible.this is a movie that was made simply because the creators (i use that in the technical sense of the word. there isn't a whole lot of creative imagination at work here.) had the legal rights to do so. the plot will be undoubtedly mirrored in the anticipated big-budget release set to be directed by tim story in 2005, but tackling a massive special effects project like this without a comparable budget or qualified actors qualifies as an act of cinematic insanity. what special effects exist are mostly hand drawn or simple camera tricks that have existed since the days of the original 'the great train robbery'. when half of the climactic fight reverts to full-on hand animation, you're almost relieved to be watching a cartoon instead of the poor actors who were damned to be in this project. there is very little consistency of style in this mess as well. most scenes are either shot flat in available light or wild primary colors, and the only dressed sets are the obvious sci-fi pieces. there is camera-work, but it is mostly just keeping the characters centered on the screen and minimal information flowing to the audience. editing includes leaving in extra lines and using obvious wipes (at one point there is even a transition using the center of a number 4). editing spins are even used to supplement the poor special effects when the thing transforms. the one scene where morphing technology was put to use was shocking only because it was such a positive jump up in quality.limited camera work is not unforgivable. in 'clerks', only the most basic camera movements are used and there is almost no style. it worked for that film because it was about people whose lives had no style, and it was consistent. kevin smith never let his reach exceed his grasp. 'the blair witch project' caused some audiences to suffer motion sickness from the jerky hand-held stuff that put that pseudo-documentary together. when all was said and done, it was an effective work about the terror of getting lost and being consumed by a frightening situation. there is no sense of story or theme here on either a spoken or visual level. with this 'fantastic four', you never get more than an accidental laugh at the fact that the film makers and performers seem to be actually trying to rival other comic book movies with this poorly budgeted entry. any film involves a great deal of time and work. it just so sad that so much of both was poured into a project like this. if you're one of the people who were involved with this, it was most likely done as a stepping stone on the road of a (hopefully improved) film career. everyone knows about taking jobs to make the most of what appears to be an opportunity. for those who are curious about watching this movie, my advice is to only do so with a group of friends (so you can all point and say "you watched it, too") who have been forewarned about the experience (so nobody gets hurt from the shock), and maybe you can come up with a drinking game to ease the pain between the accidental laughs.1 out of 10

one of the most boring movies i've ever seen. three immature young people have sex and talk about very little except their "love" of each other. they don't seem to be interested in much but each other, and only passively so. i was left feeling shut out. most of the exterior scenes take place at night, so one can't even enjoy well-lit sights of paris! i gave up after an hour and ten minutes.

this film is about a woman falling in love with a friend of her boyfriend. from then on, she has to divide her time for the two boyfriends: jack during the day and joseph during the night.this film feels like as if it was made with minimum budget. the majority of the film is set in a flat with minimal furniture. there are only three main actors, all the other actors listed in the credits make only momentary appearances. the wardrobe designer doesn't seem to have much to do, as the actors wear very down to earth clothes, and actually most of the time they are naked anyway.the film is very dialog heavy, which should have made up for the shortcomings described above. however, the dialogs sound too composed and awkward. in the beginning of the film, most of the dialog is a person saying a very long sentence, and then the person says 'me too'. after the frenzy of agreement, the dialog descends into a mess of disjointed and confused word salad.the only merit of this film i can think of is that it serves as a feminist outlet which conveys that it is not just men who can be unfaithful.this film is a great disappointment.

i was looking forward to watching this film and was therefore extremely disappointed when i found it to be complete and utter rubbish. akerman's direction is both heavy handed and cliched (how much more cliched can you get than paris at night?). the male cast seems to have been chosen entirely for their resemberlance to egon schiele's angst ridden self portraits. yet the themes of jealousy and betrayal which should have been the primary focus of a film of this type are left virtually unexplored. what is left is a turgid melodrama which takes an age to get started and even longer to finish. the only advantage with this sort of film is that it makes you realise how good goddard and truffaut really are.

this hbo original is pretty straightforward and pretty dumb. armand assante, once again doing a poor stallone imitation, is ray wellman a ex-con just out on parole. all he wants is his old girlfriend lacy, played by a young marcia gay harden, back. unfortunately for ray, lacy has hooked up with stalwart elliot, played by sam neill. further complicating matters is that ray's old cell buddies want some favors and they kidnap lacy to make sure they happen. ray and elliot team up, despite mutual dislike.what follows is violent and slow, but marcia gay harden shows us why she would win oscar in the future, she's not as polished here, but her raw emotion, sincerity and some rather explicit nude scenes almost make this worth watching. almost.rent "fever" (no the title doesn't fit the film) if your a fan of hers, otherwise skip it and be grateful it's stars went on to better things.note-this is a hard "r" flick for language, violence and nudity.

i was expecting "born to kill" to be an exciting, high-tension film noir. instead, it's got two good action set-pieces (one at the beginning and one at the end) and some marvelously atmospheric cinematography by robert de grasse (usually a "glamor" cameraman and a surprising credit for a noir), but the rest of the film is pretty boring. lawrence tierney goes through his psycho kick but it's a strictly by-the-numbers performance, mechanically churning out what the audience expected from him after "dillinger" (an overrated movie but at least better than this). claire trevor's character is too stupid and unmotivated to have any audience appeal, and the action (such as it is) stays so resolutely inside that damned house in san francisco the film becomes claustrophobic instead of genuinely thrilling. it's one of those movies in which the supporting players -- notably elisha cook, jr. (whose character's homoerotic itch for tierney's is one of the few subtleties in an otherwise pretty obvious script) and isabel jewell -- out-act the leads. it also doesn't help that, nearly half a century after alfred hitchcock and anthony perkins revolutionized the depiction of psycho killers on the screen in "psycho," tierney's is so gross and obvious he might as well have "psycho" tattooed on his forehead. also, there's no indication in the film as it stands as to why the source novel was called "deadlier than the male" -- but perhaps james gunn made the female characters stronger and more interesting than they are in the film. "born to kill" is a real disappointment from robert wise, who already had some quality movies under his belt and would go on to a stellar career.

fellow giallo-fanatics: beware and/or proceed with caution  for this movie isn't exactly what it appears to be. it surely looks like a giallo, with its juicy vhs cover (showing a busty naked girl and a big bloodied knife), rhythmic title and the names of two veteran italian actors in the cast (john phillip & fernando rey), but it's basically just an erotic thriller without much of a plot. the version i watched is presumably harshly censored  with a running time of barely 77 minutes  but then still there's a severe lack of suspense, character development and most of all sadistic (and typically giallo) carnage. "eyes behind the wall" can briefly be summarized as the gathering of a bunch of perverted characters and the extended depiction of their sexuality issues. it's an interesting effort notwithstanding, because writer/director giuliano petrelli (his only film) clearly attempted to do something special, but the overall result is unsatisfying and regrettably tame. inspired by hitchcock's "rear window", the main character is a frustrated elderly and wheelchair-bound writer. he and his much younger lover get their sexual kicks from spying on the single male tenant living across the road. the tenant, respectively, likes to perform gym exercises around the house whilst being naked and clearly has bisexual desires. wheelchair guy sends his wife over and they have sex. then, there's also ottavio the butler who repeatedly rapes schoolgirls. are there any normal characters in the story? well no, of course not! the film benefices from a continuously ominous atmosphere, with a moody soundtrack and nifty photography, but none of it ever leads anywhere so it's all just sleaze & sex without significance. there's a truly bizarre twist/revelation at the end of the story, but it comes too late and too randomly to boost up the overall quality. not recommended to fans of italian horror/cult cinema, but maybe it is great viewing for psychology students, to analyze the characters freud-style.

i'm almost embarrassed to admit to seeing caligula twice. the problems with the production are almost too numerous to mention. the script is sub-standard (it's easy to see why vidal tried to disown it). the direction is worse. most of the movie consists of long shots inter cut with close-ups interspersed with cross cuts of mostly un-erotic porn (more prevalent obviously in the "uncut" version). the cinematography is especially sub par, giving the whole production a cheap washed-out look that undermines some of the elaborate set designs. the movie should've looked a whole lot better. the overall concept of placing name actors in what would've easily been an x-rated movie (guccione called it "paganography") wears thin after the first hour after peter o'toole and john guilgud exit. bob guccione obviously lavished a lot of bucks on this but it all seems like a big waste. if you want a far better understanding of the roman empire in the 1st century watch the mid-79's bbc production of i, claudius instead... and if you want porn, jeeze-louise, look somewhere else.

i rated this movie a 3 and that was generous. the scenery is ponderous and gaudy, the acting for the most part is terrible. i do think peter o'toole did a good job of acting (tiberius), but he must have been mortified when he saw the final cut of the movie. john gielgud, howsoever brief his appearance in the movie, still seemed to be playing a role from hamlet. the hard core pornography parts were neither erotic nor did they do much to further the story. okay malcolm mcdowell had a nice butt and the guy who played macro was handsome. the guy who played claudius, looked more like the traditional depictions of nero and was certainly at odds with robert graves' picture of claudius. the climactic (?) assassination of caligula, wife and child is inaccurate in that it shows him after death lying on stairs in an open-air area, when in fact he was assassinated in the underground passage on the palatine hill which ran along the front of the domus flaviana that still exists today. there are places in this movie where virtually anything drew my attention away from it--merciful distractions. if you want history, read suetonius or tacitus, if you want pornography and sadism, watch passolini's "salo", but by all means stay away from this movie.

"caligula" shares many of the same attributes as the 1970 "fellini satyricon" with bizarre sights, freakishness, and depictions of sexual excesses all set in the "glory" of ancient rome. but fellini it ain't... first of all it is not as entertaining. far too much screen time is devoted to bug-eyed, rubber-faced mcdowell in the titular role. his performance is far too fey and campy to be convincing. the portrayals by jay robinson in "the robe" (1953) and david cain-haughton in "emperor caligula" (1983) are far more persuasive and believable, with the latter being the most nuanced. relief could have been judiciously provided by developing the surrounding characters more fully. as it is, they are little more than cyphers. one example is the role of macro, played by guido mannari who has tremendous screen presence in an important role, but is mostly left in the background. the only positive features to credit are the adroit use of some prokofiev and stravinsky themes in the music score and the inclusion of some of the distasteful but nevertheless accurate actions of the despot. these two factors are far less than what is needed to relieve the prevailing tedium, however.

probably not the same version as most of the other reviewers because there`s no real hard core sex . what do people mean by hard core sex ? the sort of explicit hard core sex seen in films starring traci lords and " big " john holmes ? well anyway this is really poor film , i doubt if i`ve ever seen so many big name actors wasted in a film . the script is really poor and plotless , the directing and cinematography is awful and the editing is non existant . it truly is an absolutely awful film. you could watch this ten times and still not understand what the hell it`s about . the only memorable scene is the one where people are buried up to their necks and a giant lawnmower comes along and decapitates them . yes you read that right , a film set in roman times has a scene with a head chopping giant lawnmower !trivia point. many years ago a pirate copy of the thing ( 1982 version ) was doing the rental rounds on my island and it been copied onto a rental tape of caligula meaning the pirate version of the thing starts with the first few seconds of caligula of the man and woman walking through the forest then the title sequence of the thing starts . this led people who`d seen the pirate tape to believe the forest scene was the opening of john carpenter`s 1982 film and were very confused as to what it meant. well that`s what you get for renting pirate videos . but having seen the whole of caligula i don`t know what it meant either
