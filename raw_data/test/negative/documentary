where on earth do i start with the mess that is darkhunters? firstly the script is one of the worst to ever find its way onto a cinema or tv screen and can only be described as a poorly judged stephen king rip-off. at one point the supposedly fearsome darkhunter jack claims that carol, the girl who is helping the man he is pursuing, is as annoying as "a gherkin in a burger". i would be laughing if i was making it up-but i'm not! just as ludicrous is how carol originally came to have the power to see how people die. a cat gave it to her when she was holding it during an auto accident she had as a kid. what????????secondly, for a horror movie, it has no sense of tension or threat whatsoever. this may not be helped by the fact that all the action happens during stark, broad daylight. not very atmospheric at all.thirdly the acting is truly awful, pinion proves again that he needs to be speaking in his native tongue to be even remotely believable. jeff fahey is obviously on auto-pilot but how can blame him as he runs through a woe-ful humphry bogart impersonation as barlow (marlowe-barlow? we get the joke it just isn't funny). credit should go to susan paterno, an actress i was not aware of, she does her best with the awful part she has and puts the other, more experienced actors to shame.at no point is it even explained how the human character can understand what van husen's character is saying to her. she obviously has some sort of degree in screwy alien languages.on the plus side one moment is well done, the car crash involving susan. the sfx are throughly believable and if it weren't for the hilarious storyline reason for this to occur it would have been applauded.all i can say about darkhunters is that british horror will never recover from its interminable slump if movies like this continue to be made and shown. avoid this movie like the plague, although the plague would be a lot more scary.darkhunters 0/5p.s. the insinuations in other reviews that the film remains too intelligent for some are honestly hilarious. it is a weak defence when some claim "you didn't like it because you didn't understand it". the letters after my name make a fool of you not me.

hey guys and girls! don't ever rent, or may god forbid, buy this piece of garbage. i have rarely seen a film in any genre as bad as this one. the acting is actually worse than me and my friends did when we were 7 and in the 1.grade had to act in front of all parents and siblings. in fact, we would have been taken up to evaluation for the oscars, if we were to be compared to the actors in darkhunters. the story is terrible, the makeup is terrible, the filming is terrible, the set is terrible, the directing is terrible, etc. i can't actually find anything worth the money spent to see this film.. maybe except all the cats, which my girlfriend thought were kind of cute. please, use your money on other things than on this film.... i couldn't even see the last 15-20 minutes of the film, it was that terrible.. if anyone really liked this film, i would really like to hear from you, and i will try to see if i can get you some counseling at a psychiatrist's office near you..0 out of 10, actually below if possible.. not worth the dvd or tape it is on..

i don't even understand what they tried to accomplish with this movie, i mean really. you got this guy running from a bunch of cats, because he's dead, but in order to be really dead this girl has to shoot them? and they leave a corpse even though normal people can't see them because their dead? the script already has a hole in it the size of nebraska, then you have the main character played by susan paterno who just drones up her lines in a monotone, boring voice and with so little emotion on her face she might as well have starred as a female terminator robot. it's absolutely horrendous and i don't even understand how i managed to see it all the way to the end of the movie. the end being just as stupid as the entire movie mind you, and with absolutely no reward in it for the viewer what so ever. they might as well have called this movie "the little movie that could choo-choo ka-choo."

it's a shame. there's an interesting idea here, but it gets completely lost in a confusion of commodore 64 style computer effects and bad storytelling. the plot, such as it is, concerns a bounty hunter of souls. it should be a fairly straightforward hunter/hunted kind of story, but the director and/or the writer seem like they forgot what the movie was supposed to be when they were about three days into shooting. things aren't helped by the fact that the main baddie looks like he's wearing a cheap darth maul mask, which they tried to disguise with flowing cg colors. not much to recommend here, even the title seems to propel it into obscurity.


i just happened to stumble to this film and checked imdb for more information: score 6,7, well... not so bad. genre: scifi...good i like scifi. so i got the movie and i was looking forward to have a relaxing sunday evening watching it. but but...no.as in summary, this isn't a movie at all. it is a religious advertisement, including: preatching about jesus, god, devil, end of the world etc. movie starts with a epic abduction story: driving at night, car stops, bright light and so on... well, actually that was the film. last of this ..ummm... frankly i don't know what to call it...was dialogue about end of the world and last judgement. quite a same stuff what these tv-preachers tell you, but they are "good" at it.honestly, if you wan't to see a scifi movie or something with ufos, please stay far away from this "thing". it has nothing to do with them. if you want to hear some cuckoo head's opinion what the bible has to say and what you should do. then go ahead and watch this "thing", but i still prefer going to the church at sunday.this is complete bull. (and evangelical christian propaganda, as another users said= well... i should have red another users comments before i got the movie. (27% of voters have rated this "thing" as 10. yeah, right. please, go somewhere else to do your propaganda)

christian propaganda...lots of fear mongering...this is not scifi, this is chrifi (christian fiction).the movie started out ok but took a sharp christian right turn. from then on it was all about god, jc, the holy bible and the devil . the ufo's are really just demonic deception to fool people in to believing that there is other intelligent life in the universe. satan's idea is to trick you in to thinking that there could be more to life than what is in the bible.the abductions could be used to explain away the rapture. the people left behind would believe it was a mass alien abduction, instead of god taking all the christians to heaven. no reason to repent if its aliens. the deeper message in the movie is that if you don't believe in god and have jc in your life than you believe in nothing and your life has no purpose.

this movie should have come with a disclaimer that it was akin to the left behind series. i did not know it would be a bible-thumping movie. i expected it to truly be a movie about ufos and alien abduction for entertainment's sake. as previous reviewer comments, it would be fine to show at a church, but not at a public theater, at least not without the consumer's prior knowledge of what the premise of the movie is about. i felt deceived out of my $$ spent for this movie, as nothing in the summary refers to its religious overtones. if you go to church, it'll probably be shown there for free some time. other than the cover-up of its true subject matter, the movie was fine as far as acting and script were concerned. but i have to say i walked out an hour into the movie when i saw what direction it was headed and that i was not going to be entertained, but preached to.

honestly i am not that impressed by it, it's not a bad movie, but it's not great one either. there's a story to tell, but it's told in a very incoherent way which kinds of makes it loose it's full meaning and ability to intrigue. this movie could of been made in another way with an outstanding result, the story is just so interesting yet somehow i'm not intrigued when watching it. it definitely isn't an amateur movie, rather the opposite and some of the scenes are really emotional. the actors and actresses does quite a good job and so does the director but there's just something so unfinished by the whole movie that i cant quite put my finger on. perhaps if you had gotten to know the characters abit more, all the 'messiness' of the movie could of been better clarified and put more 'action' throughout it cause as it was, it became abit slow from time to time.

the kite runner began as one of those "important" films that most people fawn over because they are told that they should if they want to be among the elite and quickly descended into an idiotic film of absurdly outlandish proportions.i've never read the book, and never felt the need because i honestly don't care. sure i'm called uninformed for saying it but i truly have no interest whatsoever in just another "pull at your heartstrings, copy off of all other story lines to get emotion from the readers" novel, even if it is set in afghanistan.that said, i watched the movie. i heard good things about its beauty, and how touching it was and decided why not? as it turns out, there was a very good reason why not. not only was the so called main character completely unsympathetic (i get it, he was young and this is a film about redemption but honestly he was horrible. i hated him and not in that good 'anti-hero' way, he was just a dull, idiotic, self-absorbed character that i felt nothing towards) but the rest of the story was so completely absurd that i couldn't believe how everyone else was fawning over how beautiful it was, and how they cried and it moved them. i'm sorry, but i only feel moved by something that feels realistic, sci-fi has been known to move me, fantasy as well...but this? please. this surpassed many other movies for pure absurdity! my biggest peeve, hassan was amir's brother...really? you sure you didn't just rip that off from a thousand other stories? positive that that particular tidbit wasn't just added in to try to pull more tears out of your audiences (y'know the type of people who look for reasons to cry during a movie)? i was rolling my eyes when that "twist" was revealed knowing that it could only go downhill from there (not to mention flashing back to star wars "amir, hassan is your brother" "nooooo, that's not true, that's impossible!") oh, and it certainly did. filled to the brim with cliché's and just plan dumb storytelling. like "good guy miraculously escapes bad guy against all odds with help from spunky kid who despite being viciously sodomized and having no clue who you are is willing to help out with a conveniently placed weapon that holds special meaning to you". ooh and don't forget the oh so idiotic "finally getting vengeance on the kid who teased you when you were little who, surprise surprise, has turned into a psychopathic adult" (trust me guys, i understand you like to live vicariously through movies but that'll never happen. you know that kid who teased you in high school...he's no terrorist, he's probably an accountant.) oh, and i must mention the cgi-tastic kites! i think those were on par with the "matrix" movies and "transformers" bravo you guys! bravo!it seems this movie was just made for western audiences who need to a reason to care about the middle east (hey an overly emotional friendship story will work!) this is one of the most shallow movies i've had the misfortune of seeing, it poses as deep well...but when you get right down to it, it's nothing special.unfortunately, the core of america's audience will do what they're told and follow the "it's about controversial material so it must be good!" way of thinking.

this really is a film of two halves. the first detailing the lives and friendship of two boys (one a privileged pashtun and the other a down-trodden hazara) in late 70s afghanistan before the invasion by the ussr works extremely well. the young actors turn in convincing performances and seeing afghanistan as it once was throws the present situation there into stark relief.the real problem comes when we move into the later phase of the story where we join the pashtun as a man living in america. ancient debts to his young friend lead him to return to his homeland and it is really at this point that things break down. the central adult character is clearly supposed to be sympathetic, but in fact comes across as wimpish and wallowing in self pity. it is hard to really care for him and one cannot help but feel that the really interesting story is the one we do not get to see - that of his boyhood friend.once he returns to afghanistan the narrative becomes bogged down in a series of highly contrived coincidences. most remarkably he manages to come across his childhood enemy after all these years almost immediately (even though he is not looking for him), despite the chaos that has since consumed the country. this enables him to confront past demons in a way that is simply too convenient to be credible. the resolution of the narrative is also run through with an awful, mawkish sentimentality which undermines any really serious points the film may be trying to make.although it is possible to start seeing characters and the abuses of their lives as symbols of a state which has been torn apart by world politics it is hard to really see this as a film which engages with any wider political discussion. instead the narrative becomes reduced to one character's emotional journey of self discovery and healing. unfortunately this character is so dull and wrapped up in himself that it is hard to really become engaged in his story, while opportunities to make a really interesting film about afghanistan itself are wasted.

i got a kick out of reynolds saying to his attorney, "look,i've done a lot of shi%ty thing in my life, but i never killed anyone." obviously he forgot about his career which slid down hill after he started making stupid movies like 'cannonball run.' physical evidence was originally supposed to be a sequel to 'the jagged edge' that glen close sanely rejected. the verdict is in, avoid physical evidence.

physical evidence is one of those films that you want to like but really should be a lot better than it actually is. developed as a sequel to jagged edge for glenn close and robert loggia, it gives the impression that all involved only made it while they were waiting for something better to come along. the premise is perfectly serviceable, it's mostly technically efficient if horribly uninspired with even henry mancini's musacky score surprisingly pleasant, but you can't help feeling that things would have turned out better if one of the leads had turned out to be the killer (as is rumoured was originally the case). as the opening scene of his little-seen, personally disastrous heat (1986) showed, reynolds has all the makings of a great screen villain. as is, there are few surprises and a feeling of half-hearted filming by numbers as it builds up a head of intertia as it ambles disinterestedly towards a less than grand will-this-do? finale.reynolds is fine, sailing through on charisma in what is clearly a star vehicle. unfortunately, the same cannot be said of theresa russell. an impressive and fearless actress in husband nic roeg's films which allow her to delve into the darker side of human nature, she's trapped in a part that requires star quality rather than depth, and she ain't got it in spades. she doesn't fluff her lines or bump into the other actors, but that's about all that can be said in favour of her astonishingly stilted and often amateurish performance that lets the film down badly. aside from ned beatty's prosecutor the supporting cast add only a slightly surreal presence in a boston where everyone seems to have a badly disguised canadian accent and the streets bear a startling resemblance to toronto and montreal.likewise, director michael crichton, who in westworld, coma and the first great train robbery showed that he knew how to lean an audience to the edge of their seats, seems to handle the action in a purely perfunctory fashion - indeed, in one brief chase the shots don't even match and seem thrown together almost arbitrarily. the climax itself has no flair and is completely bereft of threat or danger, and many scenes are played for far less than they are worth. it's no great surprise that, aside from uncredited reshoots on the 13th warrior, crichton hasn't directed since.its watchable enough in an 80s tv movie sort of way, even if it never lives up to the promise of its opening. whether that's enough of a reason to see it is down to individual taste.

most lorne michaels films seem to fail because they're essentially just extended versions of skits that barely managed to make people laugh in five-minute segments. "tommy boy" is a character right from "snl" - a big fat lovable (in their opinion) goof who doesn't know anything.david spade gets the thankless overwhelmed everyman role. he's paired with the annoying overweight slob and they endure miserable misfortunes as they travel cross country to save daddy's business.the plot, for starters, is really faulty. the whole premise - daddy dies and rich stupid son has to save the family biz - can be traced back to just about any movie you want. like any snl style film it is reduced to a simple motivation - empty, shallow; just a reason to see a fat guy and a thin guy be "funny" together.the movie's biggest "influence" is the 1987 comedy classic "planes, trains & automobiles." that movie is great because the plot isn't stale and recycled. it's basic, yeah - a guy traveling home for thanksgiving gets stuck with a slob. but it's real, dammit. it makes all the difference. the characters are real, the situations are far more real. "tommy boy" is pure slapstick and its ridiculous situations undermine the characters - we feel nothing for them, and we don't care about what's happening on-screen. "pta" walked the careful line between outrageous and utterly believable and relate-able - "tommy boy" is simply absurd, with jokes like a simple deer-in-the-headlights turning into a crash turning into a struggle with a dead deer that really isn't dead, then awakens and wrecks their car.the whole wrecked car thing is stolen completely from "pta" and it's eerie how much stuff in this film actually does resemble the steve martin/john candy movie.farley is simply way too obnoxious to find likable - i've never enjoyed watching him in any movies and this hasn't changed my mind. spade's given very little to do, serving as the movie's most thankless character.dan aykroyd is wasted as the evil baddie who plans to destroy daddy's business. the ending is a joke, and not in a "har-har funny" way. more like a "oh god are they serious?!" way.some people dig it, that's cool. but i just can't get into it, nor do i appreciate all the stuff it "borrows" from - not just counting "pt&a" - without any credit whatsoever.

some sort of accolades must be given to `hellraiser: bloodline'. it's actually out full-mooned full moon. it bears all the marks of, say, your `demonic toys' or `puppet master' series, without their dopey, uh, charm? full moon can get away with silly product because they know it's silly. these hellraiser things, man, do they ever take themselves seriously. this increasingly stupid franchise (though not nearly as stupid as i am for having watched it) once made up for its low budgets by being stylish. now it's just ish.

hellraiser: bloodline is only a so-so film. i believe it's the fourth installment in the hellraiser series.i missed the beginning, and all i remember from there was some topless women and a box-shape thing on a computer screen. but, using my wit and intelligence, (and the info button) i soon found out that the villain (pinhead) was released from pandora's box, which, i believe is a gateway straight to hell.so, anyways, pinhead somehow comes out of the box and terrorizes the "toymaker's" family. and, that's about it. oh, and not to mention the random tortures of various people that cross his path. yawn.what mainly happens in this film is that pinhead captures the kid, and then unleashes the dog on his wife, and then kills a random person. then he husband comes along, blah, blah, blah. who cares? why it fails is because hellraiser: bloodline is too corny to be scary. look at pinhead's minion of creatures: a cheesy dog that looks like it's been turned inside out, two men whose heads and bodies are connected together, (siamese twins in a horror film?) and some person who is supposed to be a princess of some sort. (i haven't seen the previous films.) now look at the main villain. his name is pinhead. isn't that the name you call somebody when they're stupid? he has pins in his head and hooks coming out of his fingers, and he has blue skin. i suppose he would make a decent villain if he didn't have such a corny name, and a corny speech. somewhere in the film, two cops approach him and say "don't make us put some pain on you!" pinhead replies "pain? how dare you use that word! i am pain" blah, blah, blah, blah blah. it sounds a bit cliché if you ask me.don't forget the final half of the movie. the characters (and audience) get to experience more torture when pinhead attacks some futuristic asylum. some person who we don't recognize (maybe he was in the previous films. i don't remember him in the beginning of the movie.) this scene is basically one thing played over and over again: a guard goes to inspect a mysterious noise.some other guard: "oh no! he's down. i will go check on himby myself!"after he dies the same thing happens again.(spoilers) here's the thing i didn't get. in the film pinhead is supposedly sent to oblivion at the end. so, how does he come back for another four films? are they prequels? why hasn't he died in the previous ones? geez. the makers need to come up with an idea for a different series. (end of spoilers) hellraiser: bloodline is gory and full of torture scenes, but has little thrill or scare value. just forget it. bad special effects with badeverything else make this more of a snooze-fest than a good horror.good: wellsome people may enjoy the topless women in the beginning. plus, pinhead's voice is pretty cool. i suppose if you like ultra-violence, you might like this too.bad: none of the reasons above make this a very good film. the corniness and repetitiveness are pretty bad. and, who names their villain pinhead?feel free to send me a private message regarding this comment.

there's lots of ketchup but not a whole lot of sense in the supposedly explanatory third sequel, which piles on the naff visuals to no effect. good old alan smithee directed this one, in which various members of the same family (all played, poorly, by bruce ramsay) are terrorised by pinhead (doug bradley, wheeled out of mothballs for the umpteenth time). peter atkins tries to imbue his script with poetic touches but doesn't seem to realise that his dialogue is as deep and meaningful as a plate of sick. the incoherent plot fails to adequately fill the movie's meagre running time, although this may have more to do with studio interference than anything the filmmakers intended.

in the xxii century an architect by the name of merchant (bruce ramsay) commandeers a space station, which he personally designed. as can be predicted a special force is sent to retake the expensive station and put merchant into custody. upon arrival they find him partaking in a weird ritual with the use of a mysterious cubical. during interrogation he reveals that they must let him finish, what he has started or else the hell he has released will bathe in blood... in order to convince the officers holding him captive he reminisces about his heritage, about the toymaker who built the box and about the reasons as to why he is here in space...the movie that is essentially the same to hellraiser, that the quickening was to highlander. something to be ignored and forgotten, as so it won't influence the lore of hellraiser to much. by far the most trashy of the franchise with a much more low-grade feel to it than its predecessors (who let's face it were b or c class films).acting at times seems to be influenced by a mid-budget porn-flick with wooden unbelievable performances, that actually have you thinking: so when are they going to undress and start with the intercourse? surprisingly not much sex in the movie, albeit the introduction of the seductress-demon angelique (a totally superfluous character that unnecessarily messes with what we know of the world of hellraiser) offers ample opportunities for the love-making.basically the movie consists of three abruptly pasted together separate short stories (one in the future, one in the present and one in the past) which lack focus and are rushed along in amateurish fashion. the end result is extremely poor, basically underlined by the fact you have no interest into what happens to any of the characters in the film.some decent gore in the flick, but apart from that an utter failure.

" while sporadically engrossing (including a few effectively tender moments) and humorous, the sledgehammer-obvious satire 'homecoming' hinges on comes off as forced and ultimately unfulfilling. with material like this, timing is everything (michael moore knew to release "fahrenheit 9/11" before the 2004 elections), and the real tragedy of dante's film is that it didn't come out 2 years ago, when its message would have carried an energy that would have energized the dissidents further. in 2006, mockery of the well-settled bush administration hardly seems as controversially compelling (or imperiled) as it did then."frankly anyone that could be convinced of anything by a ham fisted zombie flick has questionable intelligence. and if you didn't notice, michael moore didn't exactly help to defeat bush.there was nothing engrossing about this film. i just felt disgust at how blatant and frankly stupid the film was, it was painful to watch. if you are going to do something like this you need a bit of wit. sadly this has none. a poorly done satire actually has the opposite of its intended effect. as they say, with friends like these who needs enemies.

i can get over the political parody; even if this was suppose to be a "masters of horror" flick.but, what i can't get over is the blatant usage of our war heroes (and their sacrifice) as pawns in some washed up horror maker's political statement.to me it was purely insulting to desecrate arlington, and our heroes. i have family at arlington. the idea that this guy (dante) would even portray the arlington graves being disturbed just makes me want to puke.i'm done with dante, and done with moh.

i think this movie lacks so much of substance, it is even not worth a discussion.in the first, the package is really disgusting. especially the stereotype filming and photographing. surely, joe dante's cinematic stile was appropriate and interesting in "gremlins" and "small soldiers", i mean the imaginative and visual pretty story telling of a spielberg-wunderkind (i really loved these movies), but in "homecoming" it was a completely failure. attacks of toy soldiers and hairy creatures is simply not comparable with zombie-invasions (dead, stinky, rotten beings trying to kill the living - without any logical reason, just because they hate them). zombie flicks are characteristic in plain, direct, unconventional and brutal cinematography. nothing to be seen in joe dante's debut. another point is the annoying content: really stupid dialogs between the two main characters, a gruesome exploitation of the "elder brother dies and leaves the younger traumatized" and bad acting. and, by the way "homecoming" is neither scary, nor gory - and even less entertaining. you see, it is even not a horror movie.zombie movies in the decade of their birth - it the end of 60s/ start of the 70s - used to be revolutionary, provocative (espicially through its gruesome, explicit content) and of subtle social critic. the original zombie film was actually a midnight-movie named "night of the living dead" (1968). this one was a low budget movie that covered so many controversial themes, it's hard to name them all: a visual style of hitchcock/raimi, the american lifestyle of the 70s, political aloofness, the upcoming breakthrough of the human rights of black people and the even more upcoming racism as a result on the side of the conservative americans (remember the shooting of the black main character in the end of the movie).if you are interested in the creativity of midnight movies and want to learn more about the most important ones, i recommend you "midnight movies: from the margin to the mainstream ".so steer clear of "homecoming" and even so of romero's "land of the dead".

just a few words: it's a good thing george a romero is still among us cause if he were dead, he would be forced to rise from grave to vote against the people who made this 'political satire' and the saddest thing of all is that i actually agree with these people's sentiments. yeah there's zombies in it and they do have a good reason to come back from beyond the grave: to vote. oh, and one of them finishes off the doctor from startrek voyager. that's about as scary as it will get, people. if you are looking for a horror-movie i suggest you keep on looking. and if you are looking for a witty political satire you're also in the wrong place and not just because this series is called masters of horror. but don't let me hold you back: maybe you see something i've missed. though chances are you'll be wasting your time with it just as i have. let's just say i prefer my zombie-movies with the zombies standing in frónt of the camera.

okay, it features one lovely blink-and-you-miss-it-joke (when the dead are rising from their tombs, the names of the old time "horror" directors like jacques tournier and jean yarborough are featured in the tombstones) and the smashing of morally bankrupt repu/con/rightist villains is on-target: whorish skanks preaching morals etc. but why these soldiers are anti-republicans? because they have gone to the war, most of them should be republicans, right? why they don't go to killing the enemies who killed them or something? why they all want to vote against the republicans? why this story has made of a movie? questions never answered...

the only reason i gave this episode of "masters of horror" a 2 instead of a 1 is because the two lead actors are good, and it wasn't shot on vhs. the story, the dialog, and the plot are ridiculous. talking / driving zombies who come back to vote and sway the political tide against the war! give me a break! what next, zombies who come back to go skydiving? maybe zombies who come back to host qvc shows? i never supported the iraq war, but i do support the courage and sacrifice of the men and women of our armed forces; and "homecoming" was disrespectful in that it mocks the true horror of war. with zombies being mass produced in today's market... this is the spam of zombie-related entertainment. how "homecoming" made it onto "masters of horror" is beyond me.

homecoming; what a huge disappointment!! after reading the plot summary (the dead coming back to vote - against george w. bush!!!!!) i couldn't wait to see this. it started off interesting and it immediately caught my attention. unfortunately, though, it slowly descended into a boring political satire that i didn't need to see (i can just watch some good old aussie comedy for that!). there was pretty much only one or two scenes of horror and they weren't even that scary. i couldn't believe this came from joe dante, who could easily have pulled it off with an equal balance of thrills and satire.the worst episode so far.2/5.

i disagree with dante portraying the democrat-supporting zombies as creatures with an average iq of 23. i do believe their behaviour should reflect a lower iq than that, something in the order of a pelosi iq... a single-digit figure, please.the moh series is quite uneven, and this is the very worst episode. dante, yet another mindless hollywood liberal (or an apolitical nerd who sucks up to the leftist establishment in order to re-kindle his pitiful career?), must have finally realized that his directorial pursuits had been stuck in a low gear for nearly two decades now, hence came up with this cringe-inducing, unsubtle, left-wing "satire" of the bush administration, republicans, and capitalism. perhaps he felt he hadn't been overtly political before. he wouldn't exactly be the first no-talent to use asinine political propaganda to further his career, when all else fails. the maker of turds such as "piranha", "the howling", and "matinee", dante has been as useful a contributor to the horror genre as adolf hitler had been to world peace.th uses lowest-common-denominator humour, cheap and predictable gags which even the bluest of all blue-collar union members wouldn't have trouble understanding. or have you ever seen a clever, subtle, intelligent liberal satire? populist manure has the basest of all messages, hence the language and manner in which this message is communicated has to be as simple and basic as sean penn's name. and what better people to send this message to the popcorn-munching sheep than a couple of cocaine-sniffing tinseltown losers who've all fallen so low that they're forced to write for tv...i don't want political propaganda, either left or right, in any type of movie. but placing it in horror - of all genres - is a testament to the endless stupidity that reigns so supreme among hollywood's anti-intelligentsia. so vapid was dante that he even failed to notice the hilarious suggestion that zombies would vote democrat... (that's what you get for finishing a movie school: not a source of wisdom or useful knowledge by any stretch of the imagination.)

---------spoiler alert----------------------------this was the worst of the series, it is horror disguised as political satire and it is as subtle as a sledge hammer, not very scary and not very insightful. did micheal moore have anything to do with this piece of garbage.?i'm really sick of hollywood using entertainment as a political campaign against george bush and constantly repeating the same talking points over and over again. this movie wants to be deathdream, but unlike that movie which subtly poignantly tackled the problems soldiers who came back from vietnam by clever making the main character come back as a blood craving zombie and slowly built on this theme: it was a true horror film that was also good social commentary, because it didn't get sanctimonious, exploitave and preachy.i guess joe dante, thought this was trying to make a horror film to scare republicans, conservatives and libertarians and me being the last in that list found this film to be totally ridiculous, manipulative and exploitave all at the same time and i don't mean the good type of exploitative, that you often find in the " drive-in" type movies, i mean exploitative in the most sickening and vile manner: using the deaths of our soldiers as a manipulative political statement disguised as a horror film. this film assumes that all the soldiers who died in iraq, would vote against a conservative president if they would come back to life as zombies, which is a flawed premise, because as i recall for the most part and going by george romero's rules; zombies are mindless, flesh eating creatures, operating on pure impulse and even though the zombie andy, in deathdream could talk, he couldn't really hold a conversation and he was driven by his addiction to human blood. okay, zombies are mindless creatures driven by impulse and not intellect and obviously they are dead, so why would dead people be allowed to vote in the first place? my interpretation of this film is that the only war a liberal democrat could win is by having mindless, dead people vote for him, i guess they meant to say the people that vote for presidents like george bush are the mindless zombies, while the real mindless zombies, are actually the ones making the intellectually sounds decisions. yeah, whatever. dawn of the dead tackled this idea much better, but user the idea of mindless consumerism. this film isn't dawn of the dead by any stretched of the imagination.the film addresses the issue while the soldiers are alive that a majority of them voted for a bush like president, but after they die they would vote for a liberal anti-war democrat after they are zombies, who are normally considered brain dead creatures and laughably has them destruct after they vote.if you are gonna make a zombie movie mr. dante and invoke george romero's name in it, you better have mindless zombies that like ripping people apart and eating their intestines, not zombies that vote. i also like how the zombies just go "evil" conservatives who support the war.if you want a good movie with social commentary skip this poorly made, preachy piece of junk and watch deathdream instead.the worst of the master of horror series hands down.

i had enjoyed the masters of horror series until i came upon this infantile dung heap. this anti-bush propaganda piece masquerading as a horror film comes off like an episode of the original batman done by michael moore. political satire should be clever, this however, pulls a ten on the simpleton scale with all the style and credibility of an l. ron hubbard film.in its campy, inane way, it accuses the republicans of stealing elections, going to war for absolutely no reason and treating servicemen and women as mere cannon fodder. it even takes a swipe at the second amendment and religion. all that was missing was caesar romero as the president cackling in glee about how he orchestrated 9/11.i guess the ending was supposed to be the "we support our troops" moment, but i think they would be more offended than pleased with the entire endeavor.i'm sure the hollywood elites are sitting in their malbu mansions patting each other on the backs for this "pithy" work while the misinformed anti-war drones hail it as genius. time to get fitted with new tinfoil hats kids.

i can appreciate satire that goes against my own views but it must be witty and well-placed. this film is...how can i possibly explain it. it does not make the slightest attempt at subtlety, much less intelligence. in fact, it's hardly even horror. dead soldiers come to life but they're not interested in brains, only in voting booths. why? cue a never-ending stream of the most idiotic, banal, bloated windbag ravings of "bad president, bad conservatives, bad republicans." what a self-indulgent, schmaltzy, cornball piece of hog manure this was.even if they agree with the episode's "points," only the stupidest of liberals would say they enjoyed watching it. then again, assigning a degree of stupidity to the crazed, angry, hostile, anti-social and anti-anything-halfway-normal liberal spectrum is a tall task in itself.avoid like a liberal convention.

dear mr dante, dude, seriously... the title of the show is "masters of horror". and be that as it may, it is supposed to be an opportunity to show of your horror chops, to show the world why you deserve to be called a "master" of the genre. appearantly you misunderstood the exercise. appearantly you thought it was your opportunity (or worse, your duty) to educate the american public on your political beliefs. and your attempt comes off as disgusting, overbearing, and above all preachy.the only reason anyone marked your short as a high score is because their political views match yours and they are the type of people that don't mind having that sort of politics shoved down their throat.i, on the other hand, don't give a damn what you believe, they believe, or i believe... i just want such obvious (not subtle) and unfunny (not satire) messages out of my horror. and while there were certainly other "masters of horror" that were big time disappointments or where i was just generally confused why that director (william malone?) would be considered a genre "master"... yours fails far beyond the rest for just missing the entire point of the series.so next time... can you please just keep your preachy politics to yourself?

i was looking forward to dante's contribution to this excellent horror anthology series from showtime, but this was easily the worst of the bunch. it's really too bad. part of this may be due to the poor, if odd, choice of source materials. why joe didn't just write an original, i have no idea. instead, we get this soapbox episode where the "message" overwhelms the script, the characters, the staging, everything, and by the end i was just wondering whether it could get any worse, and i won't spoil it...but it ended up getting worse. what a stinker by such a talented creative team. skip this one and buy the john carpenter one instead. it manages to balance all of the elements: horror, humor, character, vision, and it's fun. homecoming is about as fun as having a bear take a dump on you while you sleep.

the last sentence of this review is a major spoiler.i have enjoyed joe dante's work since piranha. he's done a great deal of different genre parodies that were both funny and honest.but this is pure crap. this is the kind of satire - in line with thank you for smoking - that is so literal and direct that it leaves nothing a) to be laughed at and b) to leave the audience to think about.it's a shame, because the plot and the material is so rich, timely and ripe for intelligent commentary.by the way, there is absolutely no reason for the main character to shoot the ann coulter character at the end of the film. it's just flat out ridiculous.

there are places for political commentary in film, but "masters of horror" is not one of them. i get enough of this stuff from newsweek and every other editorial in the newspaper. now i've got to watch this in horror movies? c'mon! all i wanted was a good zombie schlock film, not another "bush is bad!" rant. if joe dante wants to express his politics, let him go on air america. and if you must insist on making a "message" film, be a little more sly about it. this had all the insinuation of being slapped in the face with a dead fish.by the way joe, do you really want the left-wing voting block to be associated with brain-dead zombies? might want to think about that before making another political horror movie (god help us).

i disagree 100% with the reviewer who disagreed 100% with the reviewer who gave this short movie an "f" grade. cashing in heavily on political propaganda only obscures joe dante's lack of ability to pull another howling out of his bag of tricks. the masters of horror series was a phenomenal collection of truly horrifying tales, save for this episode.despite gaining acclaim from those who wish to promote it's political slant, "homecoming" is the least effective episode of moh season one. unlike the rest of the series, dante's entry is a parody of the genre, falling short of both horror and humor in it's ham-fisted delivery of a hackneyed political point.dante can really only be blamed for pulling this stinker off the shelf, as it wasn't his creation. the zombie sub-genre is very popular this decade, and among the crop of predictable george romero tributes and vacuous fantasies are a number of works designed to push political or (ir)religeous messages. such works are not written by or intended for true horror fans. maybe dante really isn't a a master of horror, either. what has he been up to since the howling, after all?if you want a lame anti-war zombie flick with a few pop culture references passed off as humor, homecoming may be just your thing. if you are a horror fan looking for something masterful, pick up... most any other episode of the series. my personal favorite was dario argento's "jenifer," based loosely on a classic comic short by the team of bruce jones and berni wrightson -- truly creepy.

some people thought this was funny because they loved the political issues discussed in this piece. i, however, am so tired of the state of the two party system in our country that i can't stomach propaganda from either side. i was hoping for a horror show, but got "cute" zombies and partisan bull crap. i watch my horror films to be scared. this didn't even attempt to be scary. also, this doesn't have the wit of romero in his political/cultural satire laced in his movies...this was a blatant, no-imagination story that was hard for me to stomach (for the wrong reasons). on the bright side, if you hate bush...you'll love this (i'm not condoning hate or bush with this statement)

low-budget murder mystery about a public defender trying to clear his client of a murder the man had been convicted of 12 years previously. complicating things is the fact that he escaped custody after his conviction, but the pd believes the man to be innocent of the murder and works to find the real killer. gig young as the pd is okay, and james anderson as the convicted killer is actually pretty good, but the picture as a whole just rambles along with little suspense, and despite some good character actors in the cast, the performances are generally below par. director george archainbaud was apparently more at home making westerns--he was churning out gene autry's tv series at columbia at around this time--but even if he had tried to inject any liveliness into this picture, the hack script would have defeated his attempts. average at best, the film climaxes with a courtroom scene that's straight out of an episode of "perry mason" and is just as predictable.

one reviewer says of those who might not like this film that "it will only be appreciated by film goers who weary of film as diversion". this, i feel, is rather unfair to those of us who find it boring.i have not become weary or disillusioned with film or with film makers, but found this tedious and self indulgent. but then, it's true, i'm not too big into deep meaningfulness. i feel that it may have great meaning for those in the know, you know.it is very slow and it spends a long time in trying to make its individual points, using imagery, indeed, to do so. but in such days as these, it seems possible that a film like this might be the kind of thing that you'd come across in one of those dark and daunting booths in modern art galleries, rather than on the screen of a popular cinema setting.

i found this film completely and utterly incomprehensible. i knew some of he facts about caravagggio, but here they were twisted and puzzling. the images were weirdly interesting but i was looking more for a biographical and/or critical accounting of caravaggio's life and works, not an lsd type drug trip. the dialogue was very confusing and jumping back and forth in time via the use of trains, calculators, typewriters and cigarettes was extremely distracting. had it been labelled an "artsy film" i wouldn't have purchased the dvd; now i have a dvd that i'll never watch again and who would buy it? i prefer mainstream films not those that require translation or elucidation. thumbs down on this one for me!

i went to see this film last night at the national film theatre in london, as a birthday treat. it was the the first time i've seen it, and i think it has now overtaken the dreadful "twister" as the worst film i have ever seen. disjointed for no reason, self indulgent and full of imagery that oscillates from the crass and obvious to the obscure and unintelligible, not particularly beautifully or grimily shot, i really don't understand why this is considered classic, gay or otherwise. i normally enjoy films that push boundaries or even films that are hard to watch because of their length or unusual cinematography. but this was truly, truly awful.

what we know of caravaggio suggests a strutting brawler with a healthy sense of entitlement who lived amongst whores and thieves and hustlers and put them on canvas. his works' themes were sex, death, redemption, above all, finding the sacred within the profane. he lived at a time where homosexuality carried a death sentence and political intrigue normally involved fatalities in a society defined by the maxim "strangling the boy for the purity of his scream".you can't fault derek jarman for his cinematography, nor his recreations of caravaggio's paintings and you certainly can't accuse the man of shying away from the homosexuality. but frankly, jarman never strays beyond 80s caricature. italian patronage becomes the 80s london art scene complete with pretty waiters and calculators. sean bean is a sexy bit of northern rough oiling his motorbike. tilda swinton performs a transformation worthy of a mills and boons ("why, miss lena, without that gypsy headscarf, you're beautiful..."). jarman provides caravaggio with a particularly trite motive for the murder which left him exiled.this could have been a visually stunning treatment of a man whose life was dangerous, exciting, violent and decadent but who nonetheless elevated the lives of ordinary people to the status of renaissance masterpieces, looked on by emperors and kings. instead, what you get is pierre et gilles do italy. the pretty bodies of young boys are shown to perfection, but never the men who inhabit them. jarman appears to satirise the london art scene, showing it shallow and pretentious. to use caravaggio and renaissance italy to make the point is to use a silk purse to make a pig's ear. in fairness, this film remains visually stunning, but ultimately as two dimensional as the paintings it describes.

"opposing force [1986]" wasn't as good as "dr. strangelove" and it wasn't as good as "the bridge on the river kwai". heck, it wasn't even as good as "g.i. jane", which is pretty sad.the film revolves around a basic ethical problem: in a simulated prisoner-of-war situation, how far can you go before you start breaking the law? what exactly is the law in such a situation? how can you simulate the torture of someone without actually torturing someone? can you intentionally inflict pain? how about breaking bones? mock executions? sexual abuse? severe blood loss? real guns with bullets? death? somewhere between these is a really fuzzy line dividing "acceptable" from "atrocious".now, what could you do if you found yourself in such a training program and the lines between simulation and reality begin to vanish? what could you do? this movie attempts to portray this dilemma.i found it interesting to see the types of tactics used in "resistance training". i have a brother who went through the usaf's pow training program. according to him, it was pretty close to the mark technically.the film has a fairly good premise, but it doesn't have a particularly good story. i wondered if it might be based on some actual event, but it became pretty apparent that it wasn't when the explosions started. they must have changed scriptwriters three quarters into the film, because it takes a real extreme turn and devolves into a somewhat pointless shoot-em-up with lots of distracting explosions. i found it to have a rather unsatisfying ending; again, kind of pointless. i'm left wondering what the point of the whole thing was - i'm beginning to suspect there simply wasn't one. it could have been much better with just a little more story to go along with the fireworks.

without saying how it ended, it is sufficient to say that the whole thing degenerates from about five minutes before the end. if the standard had been maintained throughout, the movie would be worth a seven.one wonders in a way why a woman was added to the cast. (well - not really!) the premise is a good one the situation the victims find themselves in is pretty terrifying and it's rather well done, but you get the impression the makers of the film lost interest towards the end, or as a previous contributor said, they changed writers and handed over to someone else.

how anyone can praise this crude film version after seeing the marvelous waterloo bridge with vivien leigh and robert taylor, is beyond comprehension.mae clarke's myra is a far cry from the role as played by vivien leigh in the remake. she plays a common american girl with a brooklyn accent and the "yeah" responses are a bit jarring when one is expecting a less coarse character. douglass montgomery (billed in final credits as kent douglass) is wildly improbable as a soldier smitten with her no matter how many times she lets him down. bette davis has a nothing role in a bit part.their melodramatic confrontations during the last twenty minutes of the film are beyond belief (extravagant bits of overacting)--even given the fact that this is a cruder version of the story when sound was only a few years old and silent acting was still the rage.just awful. and it ends abruptly with clarke losing her life during a bombing on the bridge. the end.it has none of the beautifully shaded performances in the mgm remake of 1940, including a sterling supporting cast. instead, this one is mounted with low-budget production values (and i mean a shoe-string budget) with no subtlety at all. and there's no pre-code braveness in the scene where myra tells the aristocratic lady why she must not marry her son, roy. she simply says, "i picked him up on waterloo bridge." explanation over. nothing bold there.summing up: for once, the original is not the best version by any means. vivien leigh and robert taylor have never been surpassed as myra and roy in the tender, exquisitely acted 1940 film classic.

although this series and the mini film in particular were very important at the time of release, i feel that the series as a whole was actually fairly poorly written with a weak cast. the issues at heart are extremely well portrayed yet it is difficult to relate and understand the problems within the film when the acting and script isn't convincing enough (especially when looking at the mini film).i also don't believe that this mini film or series has stood the test of time as now many of the scenes are quite laughable. the issues are still crucial but boys from the blackstuff cannot fully aid the cause of understanding the problems in britain in the 1980s.

filmmaker bryan forbes, who once displayed a light, sardonic touch with beguiling material such as "whistle down the wind" and the original "stepford wives", completely bottoms out here. not only is his direction inept, he also sloppily adapted sidney sheldon's early novel; the results are atrocious. roger moore plays a psychiatrist framed for the murder of one of his patients; rod steiger, chewing the scenery, is a hot-under-the-collar cop (it's easily his most embarrassing performance). the only actor here to exhibit some life is elliott gould, who knows a thing or two about enlivening a bum script. bland, choppy, and produced on the cheap. no stars from ****

it beats me how anyone can rate this film very highly. it is no understatement to call it far fetched. how the guy managed in such a short space of time to construct a wooden maze of underground rooms is quite ridiculous or maybe he was the greatest carpenter since jesus. the obese sheriff played by hoyt axton looked like a refugee from the jerry springer show and i found the blonde female lead jennifer jason leigh rather plain. we have an expression here in the u.k. 'mutton done up as lamb' which suits her perfectly. it wasn't all bad however, i enjoyed it immensely when the end credits rolled and 'the end' came up was quite brilliant for this hotch potch of a t.v. movie which if it had been a cinematic release would have been put on video and in discount stores in no time at all.

though it's better than most made-for-tv movies, "buried alive" is nothing more than a run-of-the-mill revenge tale. there are so many plot holes in this one, it makes you wonder why the screenwriters didn't go through a series of re-writes. the ending has a nice twist to it, but it's hardly believable.the acting by jennifer jason leigh is terrific, as always, but tim matheson hams it up with cheesy one-liners that reminds one of jack nicholson in "the shining". don't bother with this one.

i saw this turkey in the theater, but i had a good time. the special effects aren't worthy of a grade school production. a toy boat, representing a freighter, moving at speedboat velocity on flat waters while wind driven fog blows in the opposite direction. the red and blue flood lamps add that extra dramatic touch. whatever cache vincent price was supposed to bring as narrator is completely overshadowed by dreadful production work. calling this a documentary is like calling britney spears a musician. about 20 minutes into this, something struck me as very funny. maybe it was price's overly dramatic intonation of the oft-used line "they vanished into the devil's triangle! [cut to black; next story] once i started laughing, my friends joined in. next time vinny said the crucial line, someone in the back yelled out: "good!" after that, it got almost as many laughs as a marx brothers film. nobody stayed for the dreadfully serious second feature "chariots of the gods."

but it's not. the plot isn't all that bad, the actors aren't all terrible so it should be decent. instead though despite a good starting point the plot just drags on and suffers from a lot of those "i can't believe he/she is so dumb" moments so often used in horror movies to keep things going. it frustrated me at times watching some of the decision made by the lead character. also it took way too long to get to the good part of the movie. anticipation is great but you can't spend over half the movie building it up. a shame too since it got decent exposure upon release and hit right before the big halloween season. even so i have a feeling this is going to get at least one sequel, if not more so maybe they'll be able to build on the strong general plot to eventually release something decent.

young couple on the road, minding their own business and having casual sex in their car during broad daylight. yet, suddenly, they're being menaced and terrorized by a deranged psychopath in an old and rusty pick-up truck. hmm, where have i seen this premise before? oh yeah, now i remember, we've seen this a thousand times before already, and approximately nine hundred and ninety-nine of the other cases were much better than "rest stop"! this weak and pitiable new movie is insulting even to the intellect of the most undemanding horror fans, as it doesn't feature a single original twist or memorable gimmick. it's very sadistic and nasty, but every teenkill-slasher flick is sadistic and nasty nowadays, so that's no real surprise anymore, neither. the absolute main problem with this production is the incredibly large amount of dumb plot holes and meaningless sub plots. writer/director john shiban damn well realized that the ultra-thin basic storyline nearly wasn't enough to fill a whole movie with, and thus he stuffs up his film like a thanksgiving turkey with imbecile and nonsensical padding material. nicole's boyfriend vanishes at an abandoned and filthy rest stop in california. killing off her character right away wouldn't result in a very long movie and thus she subsequently encounters a motor home family of freaks, suffers from visions (?) in which she talks to the deranged killer's previous victims and she has deeply emotional (and boring) conversations with a police officer who just won't die even though a truck ran over him...twice! the dumb sub plots never lead anywhere and they're definitely the most pathetic and desperate attempts to stretch a movie's length i've ever seen. instead of all the pointless padding, shiban should have paid more attention to building up tension and make his lead characters a little more likable. jaimie alexander's character nicole is an annoying and brainless girl, and you won't really care whether she'll survive the ordeal or not. her boyfriend jesse as well as the cop are both whining losers and their brutal deaths still weren't painful enough, if you ask me. i counted exactly three sequences, all including torture and gratuitous mutilation, that were gory and exciting enough to bring a sadist smile on my face. that's still way too few for a nowadays horror movie. basically, "rest stop" is simply a miserable attempt to cash in on the success of such films like "wolf creek" and "hostel", but you're better off watching the originals. this was the first film of the new production company called 'raw feed'. they're promoting themselves as the new name in great horror, but they'll have to come up with something much better than "rest stop" if they want us to believe that.

apparently, in the eyes of some - there aren't enough horror films these days involving young people being chased across a desert by a mysterious, bloodthirsty madman in a truck. i mean, all we have so far is joy ride, wolf creek, jeepers creepers, monster man - among others. rest stop may very well be the worst out of those. it is about a girl and her boyfriend who leave their lives behind to start over together in california. along the way, they stop at a grimy lavatory so the young lady can relieve herself, but when she returns - she finds that her boyfriend and his car are gone. from there, she learns that the culprit is a guy driving a yellow pickup who proceeds to stalk and terrorize her as she hides in the restrooms. this movie is so unoriginal that it is flat out boring. the acting is annoying, the gore is mild, and the killer, whose identity is not revealed throughout the entire movie, is anything but memorable. terrible - terrible film...

i won't spoil it for you. although you probably could care less if it was spoiled (you'll know what i mean after you watch it) poor story. b-rated movie quality. typical horror -stupid situations- rare timing. i should of known, when they try to push a lot of hype in their advertising or even add "quotes". just tells me that the movie bombed big time. and they are trying to pull in everyone just so they can break even with to cost of making this bomb. i wish i could take back the time i spent watching this. i was stupid and thought that there just had to be something great around the corner. but i kept getting let down. i don't usually waste my time adding comments to any movie. in fact, this is my second post. i just felt maybe i could spare a few of you from wasting money on something that had a bunch of hype on it.

if only he hadn't bowed to cliché, mr shiban could have actually made a good film from this story. it was just different enough to keep you interested, so for the same amount of time, energy and money as was spent on this stinker, we might have had something good instead of eye-rolling.production-wise, it is as good as one could really expect from a hand-held camcorder, so he gets good marks there. it's really the script that's at fault, as the acting wasn't all that bad, either, considering what the actors had to work with.i thought the days were long gone when we would see someone, finding a radio transceiver they desperately wish to operate, first turn every knob on the thing from end to end, bash it on top 6 or 7 times, and then expect it to work. this story is ruined by a continuous string of stupid moves by all the characters except the bad guy. it's as though we are thought to be too shallow to grasp all the plot devices, so they are all spoon-fed to us to make sure we get them.i don't know about you, but that doesn't work on me. my attention ends up being occupied by the plot holes and over-dramatizations, not the story.so, since i found this to be not so bad in the technical sense, i think mr. shiban should try again, only with a proper script next time; then he might give us something worth watching.

i do not write reviews here often but i can not stand by and let other people suffer through this movie without a least trying to warn them. this movie is horrible and it is not because "i do not know what the director was trying to convey" or "i am too stupid to understand the plot"; this movie is horrible because of poor direction, screen writing and acting. this is the "trifecta" of bad move making and the reason the film was direct to video. it tries to be something like "high tension", "hostel" and "tcsm" with the lifting of some of those ideas but it just does not work. i did not have high expectations or even medium ones going into the film but was still very disappointed. it had potential to be very good with a nice setting and good idea for a film but it was wasted.

the cookie-cutter gets to work overtime in this obvious and unoriginal love story. the plot, such as it is, has been done before a trillion times so there is no need to recount any of it. suffice to say that all 12 year old girls will love this movie while the rest of us will be forced to make a face. even the soundtrack is awful! its not that i dislike figure skating, although i don't, its that i dislike cliched, bad movies.

nothing about this movie is any good. it's a formulaic predictable "romantic comedy" geared to make females force their significant others to watch. in other words, it's a predictable chic flick that is neither comedic or romantic and is extraordinarily forgettable. if you like watching the same thing over and over then this movie will fit just perfect. i was also forced to watch this with my g/f at the time and it's no surprise we are no longer together. i enjoy great movies that are wonderful to watch, while she just wants to see the same thing over and over again just with different actors. nothing good to say about this movie. the title says it all. 1/10 (one b/c i can't give it a zero.

another first: this french movie is my introduction to the world eric rohmer. perhaps i'm a bit hasty when i say that this is probably my last rohmer movie but i was immediately turned off by the way rohmer relies on monotonous philosophical conversations that never get to the point. there is a scene in the movie where the characters discuss love that i thought was never going to end. honestly, no matter how much i tried, i couldn't understand why rohmer is so highly regarded among cinephiles. he struck me as being one of those obnoxiously petulant people who are filled with hot air. if this is a sample of what his movies are about, i'm not interested. i don't care much for french cinema (usually reflective and speculative to a fault), so maybe i'm biased.

i watched this movie a couple months ago when it first showed up on the shelves of blockbuster. it is officially the only movie that i've wanted to undo watching. let me start off by saying that i like "b" movies. i consider "ice pirates" one of the best comedies ever. i'll also note that i'm a writer and that i've met the director/writer of this cinematic marvel.evaluating the acting: if i was going to pick a bright spot i'd have to point out that dion day had an admirable acting debut with his role in this. for those who don't know, dion is a boxer not an actor so we'll forgive him his lame death sequence. why doesn't he fire the shotgun he's holding once? budget? to highlight the bad acting would take pages so i'll stick to the egotistical lead, ryn baskin. ryn (which seems like a name chosen from a comic book because it sounded cool) has maximum face time in this movie, probably because he was a producer. his looks are completely fine, but his delivery evokes memories of snl ripping on soap-operas. i suppose he could only do so much with what was written for him, but part of the blame is definitely his.special effects: not my specialty, but for a low-budget flick i suppose the makeup and gun play was acceptable. it didn't bother me, but it also didn't impress.writing/directing: oscar for best screenplay is not something i can foresee gerald nott ever winning. not only is the plot rudimentary, but the dialog is flat and stilted. i understand stylized hokee-ness, but this was just bad writing. the thing that bothered me most was the theft. nott stole scenes, shots, and viggo's facial hair from a slew of other movies. the scene where russel crow is walking through the wheat field in gladiator, entire sequences from the good, the bad and the ugly, that sort of thing just doesn't cut it with me. i'll choose not to comment on the shooting because i don't know what it takes to establish a good shot etc...conclusion: don't rent this movie, don't even pirate it. it's far too bad to waste any time on. the good reviews may be entirely bogus, after meeting gerry it seems more then likely that he is posting them himself.

i'm no director or writer or anything related to a movie. but watching more than 1 movie everyday has given me the idea of what is a good movie or not. so here it is: the quick and the undead is a rip-off of the quick and the dead. i was thinking that it could be a little bit of a parody of a cool movie with lots of starts in it. but oh no, i was really in for an very big disappointment.to put it simply the movie sucks. i'm a big fan of gore movies but this one just gives you gore here and there but they are not that consistent.but i have to give them credit in creating gruesome characters which has given me a little bit of squirm.if you're a big fan of zombies, watch this. if you're not...better look for other rob zombie films.

well, here we have a zombie movie that perhaps isn't even being much of a zombie movie. the entire movie is set in a zombie-plagued near future but yet the movie does very little with this concept. instead it focuses on a zombie hunter who is trying to get revenge and his money back from a group of other bounty hunters. what good is money anyway when almost the entire world has gone to hell and towns are mostly desolate. and why pay money to people for killing zombies in the first place. as if people would not go on to kill this dangerous threatening monsters when they are not getting paid.needless to say that the story for "the quick and the undead" is far from a tight one. it of course also isn't being filled with the most logical and interesting moments, characters or dialog.still it's not a completely horrible movie. it certainly ain't as bad as some people try to make you believe it is. it's a rather good looking one, or rather said the movie at least doesn't have a cheap look over it. it's effects may be a bit overused but nevertheless they are quite good looking, as are the make-up effects as well.still the movie was not what i hoped of it. its title might suggest that the movie is set in the wild, wild west, during the days of the cowboys but its title is just a misleading one, no doubt picked to cash in on it. i fell for it, expecting this movie to be a combination of a western and a gory zombie-horror-flick.for the fans of the zombie movies this movie will mostly be a disappointment to watch. it of course adds nothing new to the genre but it also doesn't has enough of the genre itself in it to be considered a good one to watch.not totally unwatchable but also far from a recommendable one.4/10

this movie was awful, especially considering the work that must have gone into its production. though it's not as bad as ax 'em, it is quite awful. take into account the obvious rip-offs from gladiator and raiders of the lost ark, and what do you get? this smorgasbord of awful make-up and wooden acting.the movie starts as most zombie movies nowadays do. a montage of interesting jump-cuts and a radio broadcast of the outbreak at hand. we see our hero (ryn, quite possibly the worst 'zombie hunter' in modern era; counted about four or five times where he either scratched his head with the barrel of his pistol or looked down the barrel while blowing) cutting off fingers of zombies. we later learn that these fingers are collected for bounties.well, ryn seems to be a rebel in his ways of dispensing of zombies; going so far as to purchase chum *gasp* from his french buddy hans (who isn't really french, speaks with an odd middle-eastern accent). as ryn uses the chum to collect a plentiful bounty from lost hills, all hell breaks loose.and cue the awfulness of the movie. the zombies are put together quite poorly. i've seen comments praising their make-up, but it was quite amateur in my opinion. obvious halloween adhesives were used to make the zombies' faces and there were points at which one girl looked as if she were donning a clown mask instead of a freshly peeled face. oy vey.to sum the next sixty minutes up in a few lines: ryn is back stabbed by hans (who made a deal with some other zombie hunters, blythe being the ringleader), gives him a second chance, gets back stabbed again by hans, then shoots hans and gets to union city where he finds blythe is poisoning the cities for profit.that's it really in regards to plot. when ryn reaches union city all the baddies are gathered around in a house that evidently is so massive it takes ryn hours to reach the top floor. people die, ryn lives, and the movie ends with one of those cynical "is he going to kill himself?" scenes.*end spoilers* i'm going to have to blame most of this mess on nott. the direction was awful. every character featured a scowl other than hans, who was easily the best 'actor' in this group of macbeth rejects. when they reach union city, a hoard of zombies attacks the crew and the zombies were obviously given no tips or ideas about how to walk as if your appendages were rotten. one woman is swaying as if she's swimming in mid-air on a sunday stroll.some movies are awful. this movie is one of them simply on the grounds of how logic seemed to be abandoned in order to keep a story flowing. works occasionally, but in this regard (where the story was already in shambles), it doesn't.avoid it unless you want a decent laugh.

the quick and the undead is, finally, the first movie to actually render its own storyline null and void. it is, essentially, one gigantic plot hole.aside from that, the acting was quite bad, character motivations nonexistent or unbelievable and there wasn't a single character worth hanging our hat on. the most interesting cast member (who had great potential to be a dark horse protagonist) got snuffed halfway through the proceedings.what the quick and the undead does serve as is an excellent example of how to do good color-timing. it looked excellent, when you take into account budget considerations.unfortunately, it plays out like a guy got his hands on a hundred grand and watched a few westerns (most notably the good, the bad and the ugly) and then just threw a bunch of elements haphazardly into a movie... "you know, they have movies where characters do this! does it fit here? no, but who cares! they do it in other movies so i should do it here!" maybe a good view for burgeoning cinematographers and colorists (first-year film-schoolers). otherwise, a must-miss.

the plot of the movie is pretty simple : a viral outbreak turned the population into flesh-eating zombies. those who left became "hunters".well, first of all, this is not the worst zombie movie there is. among the worst are "zombiez" and the infamous "zombie lake".in fact i think, the idea for "quick and the undead" was very good, just executed poorly. considering the budget they had to work with, this movie looks very good. i wasn't bored at all while watching it. special effects were solid, although they did use cgi once (fat zombie getting shot in the head), but everything else (gore, guts) was rather good. acting is awful however. our main guy looks like young clint eastwood, other "actors" are not even worth mentioning. as far as the plot goes, they didn't work enough on the development of the story.bad : acting, low-budget. good : special effects, idea for the movie.overall, this flick deserves 4/10 from me. it's not as bad as people say. imagine a zombie western, then watch this movie.

produced by nott entertainment, this movie is "nott" very good at all. i sat through the first 15 minutes of the film before judging that the acting is bad, the casting is bad and camera work is bad. as i hear that there is a download of this film floating around on the internet, it is "nott" even worth the bandwidth.up until the time i wrote this review, the average vote for this movie was an 8.5, which prompted me to view it and there was an average high majority of 10's for it, obviously voted on by liars and shills. this movie is "nott" for everyone. or parents, if you want to punish your kids with this awful film, have them sit through this one for halloween.

the trailer for this film promised a new twist on the zombie genre: setting it in the old west. except it's not the real old west, of course. it's some sort of future west, in a world where some apocalypse has, as apocalypses are known to do, killed people and subsequently turned them into zombies. it's zombie virus time again, folks, and you know what that means? get bitten and become one of them.so, into this dusty and dead-filled world comes a hero. he's a bounty-hunter, getting paid for taking care of zombies. it's not exactly clear who is providing the funds, but it seems a little cottage industry of zombie-hunting has emerged. but, as the trailer tells us, there's a problem. they are running out of zombies. the only way to keep on earning is to infect new towns and cities with the virus.i think that's not a bad idea for a film. but unfortunately it takes a lot more than a good idea and a crowd of people pawing at windows to make a good zombie film. what we actually get is a clint eastwood clone (the actor's even called clint, for crying out loud) and his "hilarious" sidekick, trying to bag zombies while trailing some still-living bad guys to get some big reward. the whole subplot about infecting other towns is only mentioned in passing, over half-way through the film. instead, there's a lot of western movie clichés, poor zombie make-up and some world-class bad acting. really bad. the sort that wouldn't even make it onto hollyoaks. both hero and villain chomp on cigars, quips are thrown, people get bitten. as the movie lurches to a conclusion, the only thing worth wondering is whether it's going to end with the cliché of the hero being the only man alive, having killed the one he loves, or the cliché of him turning into a zombie in the final frame. (it's the first one, by the way) this film was written and directed by gerald nott. it's the only thing he has done and, hopefully, it will be his last. at the start of the film there is a caption that reads "nott entertainment". at least they got one thing right.

one look at the rating ought to tell you this movie was voted on by shills, in an attempt to artificially boost this film's ratings.this film brings nothing new to the zombie genre. in fact, it is laughably bad (in acting and cinematography) and derivative in its plot. the make-up looks horrible and the zombies look even worse when shot. lines are stiffly delivered and badly timed, with the exception of the female bounty hunter, who is the only good actor in this mess of a film. the worst offenders are the italian guy (hans), ryn the protagonist, and the lead bad guy. i've seen better delivery from pizza truck with a flat tire. this is a self-proclaimed "zombie western", but about the only thing that makes this a "zombie western" is the fact that people wear cowboy hats and the lead actor's real name is clint. the protagonist isn't cool and mysterious like a traditional eastwood hero, and as an anti-hero, he doesn't have the wise-cracking attitude to pull it off either.don't be fooled by the fake glowing reviews. this is just another b-grade zombie movie that's competently made for the budget it had (it does have some decent lighting), but it reeks of low-budget, first-time directing and bad acting. there are a lot of really stupid scenes that make this look really amateurish.

looking at the ratings you would assume this is a classic, but yet again its just another example of poor independent film makers trying to drum up interest in their movie. they aren't even being smart about it 10/10 in the votes? i guess that to buck the curve and offset all the 1/10's it will get. is this better than any decent zombie movie? no.acting, corny and rubbish.sound effects, cheap and nasty, if it wasn't for where the actors looked you wouldn't know where it was coming from.cinematography. these people act like they have borrowed their dads camera right after watching the matrix. less is more, but more from this team is absolutely pap.zombies are rubbish as well. i don't doubt most of these people will never be heard from again, and it will be for good reason. i hope zombies eat their eyes as this was 90 minutes of pap that i wont get back.and falsifying ratings just makes it a million times worse.one reviewer said it was one of the best horror movies he has seen in the last 30 years? i can only assume that his recent cornea transplant was a success then.watch the trailer as thats a warning as to how bad this film is.

i have no idea how accurate the portrayal of flynn appears in this film but even as a work of fiction it is one of the worst films i have ever seen.the script is all over the place and leaves you wondering how he got from one scene to the next - you are just not given the minimum information needed to keep some continuity and understand his present situation, and it is difficult to understand flynn's and other characters' motives behind some of their behaviour.add to that a series of silly and implausible situations and you have film that comes across as one of your dreams that seems to make sense while you are asleep, but when you wake up and you try to remember it, it is just strange, disjointed and totally unrealistic.there are many long, boring musical sections of the film that to me are either bad direction or a bad director trying and failing to be artistic.none of the characters are even likable and the flynn character comes across as a self serving liar, thug, thief, robber, murderer, bear fist fighter, gigolo and impostor who will do anything and step on anyone to further his own dreams, and somehow, despite all that, great opportunities just seem to miraculously fall into his lap.this film is not entertaining nor satisfying in any way and by all accounts not even historically accurate, so why even watch it? to rub salt into the wound, the dvd had one of the worst transfers i have ever seen, it wasn't even in wide-screen or dolby 5.1, it had terrible telecine wobble and many, many artifacts from what looked like a film reel that had been gathering dust and scratches somewhere.

even though he only made his debut film in australia and left for great britain and then america to continue his career, australians will tell you that the greatest film star they ever produced was errol flynn. i'm not sure he ever even went back to australia after his breakout success in captain blood. still i attribute this film to the well known aussie irreverence for trashing the reputation of one of their own.part of the problem in telling errol flynn's life story was that he told enough tall tales in his life right up to the very end in his memoir, my wicked wicked ways. i could see that a lot of the film was based on that and upon reading between the lines of that book.his mother's infidelity to his father was not written, but could have been inferred in reading my wicked wicked ways. he didn't particularly like the woman, that is clear from a few sources. i wish the film had dealt more with his new guinea adventures, that to me was the most interesting part of my wicked wicked ways. as for his street fighting in the depression, i tend to disbelieve that. even if he had been successful at it, i guarantee that enough of that would have ruined his looks and he would never have had a career as a leading man.still the folks down under seem to think the atmosphere of sydney during the depression was captured well and guy pearce is a charismatic errol flynn. american audiences know him best as the uptight, but honest lieutenant exley in la confidential which came out the same year as flynn.but la confidential was a far better film.

this film takes a lot of liberties with the known historical facts.even little things like flynn licking one stamp after another, when he almost certainly would have used a moistened sponge, is one of the annoying things. flynn was never tried of manslaughter or murder. he is not known to have caught his mother making love to another man, and is not known to have had an homosexual relationship with anybody, and he did not end up on skid row in sydney. he did not get his twopenny-halfpenny role in in the wake of the bounty by imposture and this role did not turn him into a well-dressed film star. this is just a mediocre film where the name of errol flynn has been tacked on just to sell more tickets and more videos.

i can only think of one reason this movie was released. to capitalize off the upcoming fame of guy pearce. this movie has no merit at all and needlessly trashes errol flynn's memory. the homosexual encounter was pure speculation. the disdain shown for flynn in this movie is palpable. an easy way to slander an actor who died years ago. horrible and embarrassing. very disappointing. don't waste your time on this utter trash. watch my wicked wicked ways if you want to learn about this fine actor or read his autobiography. this movie is not the way.

guy pearce almost looks like flynn, and this resemblance is the only one this film can claim. nowhere in flynn's autobiography is the klaus reicher character mention, the homosexual encounter is speculative fiction, and the movie's claims that flynn treated native labor badly are groundless. director frank howson hasn't made any memorable films, and i find it lame for him to groundlessly slander flynn to further his unremarkable career.

one wonders how flynn could have failed so badly as a cinema release in 1997 with guy pearce aptly in the lead role. it is not often that the casting of someone so famous is so exactly right. flynn was a stumbler at the box office and did not end up on cinema screens in australia...even after la confidential...! from a dazzling nude scene in the first few minutes (presumably by guy pearce) flynn gets off to a fairly robust and interesting start. sadly, flynn runs out of steam after about the first 35 minutes and with the entrance of hammy steven berkoff in a detour to new guinea, (looking and acting like he wanted the klaus kinski role in fitzcarraldo) the film starts to resemble a tele movie rather than a major cinema biography. believe it or not, by about the 70 minute make, it is boring and you are glad to see it over. but such promise! pearce is flynn! but the movie caused a mutiny at the box office and unlike the bounty, sank without trace.

i bought this video on a throw-out table at the video store expecting a good cast in what was touted as an award-winning brit sex comedy. i guess i should have read the finer print. i rarely write a panning review, but here goes.these actors in gay roles really play games with your memories of a lot of far more worthy films. this comedy was a very cruel joke at the expense of the actors, the theatre-going public and of all the nice films that have contributed to their reputations.i repeat: is the joke about trashing the actors' other highly respectable on-screen personae with this scurrilously trashy flick? can the reference to the austen classics 'pride and prejudice' and 'sense and sensibility' be anything else? how much of a political statement was it to produce this melodrama using these stars? are we meant to simply take it as a lay-down misere that all actors are gay and thus letting their on-screen roleplay affect our lifestyles is accepting their private homosexual dealings in our faces, too? i'm sorry, but i don't think so. i say no to this one.

the daytime tv of films. seldom have i felt so little attachment to characters. seldom have i been made to cringe by such dire dialogue. nauseous london thirty-somethings mincing round lurid bbc sets spouting platitudinous mulch. avoid this film as if it were your grandmother's clunge.

"go fish" garnered rose troche rightly or wrongly the reputation of a film maker with much promise.its then hard to understand how she could turn out a movie made up of stereotypes that one associates with inferior sitcoms. the entire film rings hollow. i cringed the whole way through.its supposed to be a look into nineties human sexuality. well not much more here to be learned than from "in and out". by now most of us actually do know, that there are men who are sexually attracted to women and there men who are sexually attracted to men and there are even men sexually attracted to both sexes. seldom has this revelation been portrayed on the screen with so little wit and style.pathetic.

i found it hard to care about these characters, who were either annoying or insipid, all living their fabulously hilariously urban lives.the dialogue was excruiciating at times, and at other times the narrative seemed hard to follow - was it me or were entire scenes deleted?it felt like a poor sitcom somehow turned into a film. the stereotypes and jokes about "men's groups" would perhaps have been funny in the early 90s. as it is, this is where much of the humour of the film comes from - and boy, does it get old fast.apart from the attractive irish man - this film was a dud. and not even in a "so bad it's good way". the last 20 minutes were particularly painful. perhaps if you've never met any gay people or never thought about homosexuality before, then this film might have something meaningful to say. otherwise - darlings, you'd still be better off renting the boys in the band or beautiful thing.

this movie starts at a and never quite reaches b. its title promises far more than the film delivers. it's superficial and filled with the usual cliches of a story in which a guy questions his sexuality. the people are agreeable, even the obligatory flamboyant type. the lead (kevin mckidd) overacts insofar as there's a reason for him to act at all. simon callow, playing a horny straight, is always worth watching, and he's by far the only reason to stay with the movie. however, the rubbish about his men's group "meditations" or whatever they are grows extremely tiresome in short order. they seem to have been thrown into the movie's mild mix in a misguided effort to vary the setting and non-stop inaction. the same comment applies to a really odd and unconvincing camping trip. don't worry about pausing the tape so you can get a snack. let the thing run; you won't miss anything. hugo weaving's character is superfluous. he appears in a sequence with one of the lesser leads and doesn't even meet the rest at all. the outcome of that sequence isn't explained, and hugo's real estate dealings have nothing to do with the story. the movie is a total disappointment at the end, because there is no resolution. the thing simply fades out and we're sent to the closing credits. this is an interlude with no structure.

ok, so this film is well acted. it has good direction but the simple fact is that it undermines what all gay and lesbian people have been fighting for all these years. the straight man "deciding to be gay" and the gay man "deciding to be straight" i did enjoy it up until the last 20 minutes, after that i got really offended. as what usually happens in these films the straight actors play the main parts and the out gay actors play the secondary straight roles. the leads are played by handsome men but don't let that distract you from the fact that this is a a film that leaves you feeling unfulfilled. all the romance and relationships you hope would happen do not. unless you are a priest that is in which case god bless straight woman who cure our homos.

time line of the film: * laugh * laugh * laugh * smirk * smirk * yawn * look at watch * walk out * remember funny parts at the beginning * smirkunfortunately, this movie has a good concept that it grinds to the ground.

it's awful.pretty succinct review i know, but it has been a long time since a film has left me in such a bewildered state - wondering how the hell a film like that gets made.the last time it happened was last years turkey 'mission to mars'.salvatore coco is an ex-con - trying to better himself through self help videos, endless seminars and betterment courses. he lives by the catchphrases these courses expound.he stumbles across a washed up nightclub singer, played by nikki bennett, and has an epiphany; his new career is going to be that of a talent agent - with the singer as his one and only client.financed by his gospel singing, paraplegic girlfriend, played by sasha horler - he sets up shop and tries to relaunch nikki's career, with disastarous results.'walk the talk' is the reason why australians are so contemptuous of australian cinema. it is poorly constructed, lame and way wayyy too long (111 minutes for a comedy that should barely have scraped the 80 minute mark).every scene is too long, and are very repetitive. the audience is not given a character to empathise with; a vital ingredient in a film like this supposedly about an 'underdog' giving it a go.the downbeat and frankly poor ending comes at the end of 30 minutes of the most mind numbing dialogue and scenes that have you crying out for a power failure.this film is a failure on all levels - made worse for queensland audiences by its liberal and innacurate use of various gold coast/palm beach location; and its laughable use of brisbane suburb names like norman park and caboolture.

this woman is a terrible comedian. she can't crack a joke. she has no real character. this is another example of typical american rubbish, that people laugh at, because they have no idea how to react, so they say to themselves, "well, it's a comedy show," so i'll laugh, i guess.i cannot stand this miserable woman, and her pi$$ poor excuse for comedy. she does not deserve anything but booing.why can't america dump this kind of turdish delight, and go for something that actually contains humour.she is not funny. not at all. why oh why does even one person like this idiot?

there's some nice scenery to look at here,if you can keep your eyes open long enough to see any of it.i'm a big fan of slice-of-life movies,but these people are just plain bland.although there's nothing political here,the entire film can be looked at as a political statement,in that it shows how communism destroys the individual,making everyone the same bland animal that just spends its life sleeping,eating,and occasionally making love.

a few years ago i saw the scent of green papayas by the same director. my feelings about both films are in fact the same: beautifully shot, but terribly slow and boring. i saw this film in a sneak preview, and left after half an hour. couldn't stand it anymore. how can one make an interesting film about people who are constantly telling each other how happy they are, and how perfect their lives are.........? i had a fantasy about a forgotten american g.i., still wandering around in the vietnamese jungle, who was not aware the war had ended. how he would suddenly pop up in the film, and would start emptying his m16 at the characters in the movie. the red of their blood would make a beautiful contrast with all the green plants in the film........... so i was not very much gripped by this film! time to leave!

this is the worst film i've seen in a looooong time. it reminded me of a cirque du soleil show i saw in vegas six years ago -- without the athleticisme. by that i mean a few striking, artsy, images appear randomly, without any sustaining framework. the fake sepia tinted film is really tacky. this device is almost never justified and certainly is not in _tuvalu_. with apologies to abe lincoln: you can fool some of the people some of the time.

the cavern: 2 out of 10: blair witch meets the cave and gives me a headache.i have something to ask all film schools, could you please teach future directors how to hold a camera steady. flailing the camera around like aunt betty with 12 drinks is headache inducing.also film is primarily a visual medium directors may want to point their camera's in the general direction of the action. film also requires light to work. perhaps a light source should be employed so one can see the action on the screen. i know it is a cave movie but there is absolutely nothing frightening about watching pitch blackness for minutes at a time.for that matter showing the film upside down doesn't indicate confusion on screen it indicates confusion in the editing booth.a last note to the director i'm sure there was a good reason to have a horribly fake cgi campfire. i honestly can't for the life of me think of one.now on to the screenwriter. try to make at least one character likable. i'd prefer two or more but one decent person i can root for or care about might help. also if you are going to have flashbacks make them relevant to the story.if you are going to have a surprise ending it is probably best if it doesn't contradict every single thing that comes before it. and try adding some fancy spelunking terms to a cave movie. you might have wanted to start with spelunking.the cavern is a pretty bad film, poorly shot with a confusing, improbable and anticlimactic ending.

possibly the worst movie i ever saw. the person who shot this movie probably never learned not to film directly into a shining light. you can't see anything in this movie. it is way to dark. the parts where you can see something the camera is directed straight at a light source so you get big lens flares. so you still can't see. this movie should have been a radio play or something. some parts of the movie are actually edited upside-down for some kind of crap effect. low budget movies can be done so much better then this. and low budget is no excuse for this. an editor should have said something when he started editing and saw that you couldn't see anything. maybe the makers should have spend some of their low budget on a preview monitor so they could see what they shot. the only good thing about this movie being so dark is that you can't see the awful acting. it also covers up the crappy sfx. people at beginner film schools make better movies then this. movies shot with handy cams look better then this.

the movie goes something like this: run around, run around, someone killed, lots of freaking out and then one of the group yells to "pull it together" or "just calm down!" repeat this as many times as their are characters left. in between these things, you get to enjoy blank, black screen. these are not quick but rather several seconds long. i kept thinking what a waste of film every time it happened - yes, it does happen more than once if you can believe it.i notice other mentioned "blair witch: and it did remind me of that in the way the camera was bouncy. however, this movie takes that to the extreme. every single time the characters move the camera is bouncing. sometimes so much that you can't make heads or tales as to what you are looking at. that brings us to lighting. way too dark in some areas. i get that they are trying to make us feel like we are in a cave, but helllloo... i'm watching a movie here, it would be nice to be able to see.then there is the ending. i actually blurted out loud, "are you kidding me?!" (i was watching alone too). dumb, dumb. i think the ending was purely the effort of the people who made this disaster to shock us after so much time of boredom with a so called "twist". at this point of the movie you could have seen the "monster" picking his nose and it would be considered a "twist". truly horrible. you have been warned.

my first post at the imdb has to (unfortunately) be to warn others not to waste their time with the cavern! there is no story, no character development, no scares, and no good lighting. it doesn't make any sense. if you enjoy bad acting, people running through small portions of caves, bouncing cameras posed at bad angles, and people screaming while the screen is in complete darkness, you'll love this movie. i could shut the lights off in my house and scream too, and i wouldn't have to pay for the rental. the only thing that scared me was that someone actually made a movie this awful.... one of the worst movies i've ever rented.

so you have the spoiler warning---but i would argue that you cannot spoil what is already rotten. i assume they changed the name to "the cavern" just in case "within"s reputation had preceded it.after paying the cable rental for this movie, i considered saving my household garbage for a month and mailing it to the writer/director. he had his garbage delivered to my home, so i thought it only fair that i return the favor.the movie opens with a suggestion that the scene is in the desert of kazakhstan. i'm not sure why they picked kazakhstan; maybe the writer is a fan of the ali g show. but they should have just started inside the cave, because the outside was obviously not kazakhstan. it was the first clue that i was going to hate the movie.the movie has no redeeming qualities, save one: it's consistent. everything is terrible. the writing, the directing, the acting, the cinematography---every aspect of this film is just bad. and i like bad films, goofy films, b-horror films . . . but this was just plain bad. and stupid. and hackneyed. and predictable. and boring.to get a feel for the film, go into your laundry room with 5 of your friends, and turn off the lights. put a flashlight (turned on) into your dryer and start it tumbling. now all of you start screaming and yelling at the top of your lungs. that's it.for a complete re-enactment, have 5 of the 6 people in the laundry room play dead on the floor. toss karo syrup on them. turn the lights back on (stop the dryer). now have a guy in a gorilla costume enter the room and rape the last person standing.finaddendum: reading through the other comments, many find it remarkable this movie was made on a low budget. that's not remarkable. making a crap movie on a huge budget is remarkable (waterworld). making a good movie on a low budget is remarkable (like blair witch, which i thoroughly enjoyed). making a crap movie on a low budget isn't a bit surprising, and you can expect more of the same if these people are still making movies, because i can't imagine anybody would hand them a pile of cash after watching this.is the low budget an excuse for a terrible film? no, and it's certainly no reason to watch it. would you eat a dog-dung sandwich just because it was cheap to make?the imdb rating for this film over time will be interesting to watch. it should trend farther downward, but only if the number of unsuspecting innocent viewers can outpace the movie makers' ability to beg their personal friends to give it 10 stars.

let me start off by saying i love japanese cinema, literature and culture generally. i've seen many japanese movies and enjoyed them, but "portrait of hell" (aka jigokuhen) makes itself ridiculous. the two characters who dominate the action -- the "evil lord" in his privileged bubble and the "stubborn, crazy artist" are pure types with zero subtlety or nuance, and all their actions emanate from cartoonish extremes. the film wants to show horrible scenes of violence and raw emotion but many of these scenes are so over the top they actually become laughable and the overall feeling is that of a made-for-tv movie that went off the rails. if this rarely screened movie falls in your hands or comes to your town, spare yourself and give it a pass.

this is bad movie. there is no denying it as much as i'd like to. tommy lee jones is about as good as he possible can be with the script they gave him, and he had a couple of decent action sequences that felt really out of place due to their acceptable quality.somewhere along the line someone figured that all of the shortcomings of script could be counteracted if they were to hire every single workhorse actor in the business, unfortunately even truly, deeply talented actors like goodman, beatty, sarsgaard, gammon, steenburgen, macdonald, pruitt taylor vince, and lest we forget mr. jones himself can't fix the wooden dialogue, and plot progression that went absolutely nowhere.in fact at one point i looked up, sure that the movie had been running for the past 2 hours only to find that i was 51 minutes into it.perhaps the most painful point of the movie was the subplot about the ghost confederate soldiers that seem to be of little to no help to the story. other than slightly detracting from the confusing business at the end with the picture. *if you haven't seen this movie disregard this past statement which may seem tantalizing and know that it is not, you will not understand it any better after having watched the movie.the most interesting thing about this movie may be that it is actually a sequel to the movie "heaven's prisoners" starring alec baldwin in the same role carried by tommy lee jones in this movie. i may have to watch it now, first to see if it is as bad as in the electric mist, and second because i can't seem to (no matter how hard i try) break my man crush on alec baldwin.

i have seen this movie last week during the berlin film festival and had medium-high expectations. - the director is bertrand tavernier and i was familiar with some of his previous work in french cinema. i actually enjoyed some of his earlier movies. -the cast: tommy lee jones, john goodman, peter sarsgard, mary steenburgen... i was looking forward to see all this talent on screen. -i wasn't familiar with the book it's based upon and i hadn't read anything about the movie beforehand but i was told that it was an investigation movie set in the deep south (we've seen a lot of those in the past, maybe this one's gonna be as good as the others...)2 hours later, the end titles appear: thank god it was over!!!! - the plot is beyond comprehension. if you've read the book, you have a significant advantage. there were too many minor characters and there were a lot of useless plot arcs. we didn't understand a thing! - the accents. my god! tommy lee jones' accent is decent but i still have nightmares from mary steenburgen's cajun-french singing... - poor casting in my opinion. i can't believe old man tommy lee jones can beat the crap out of a linebacker-built goon... and i'm not afraid of john goodman. - who were these people?!? we barely understand who all these characters are and what they do. there's a bait shop? tommy lee jones has a girl from guatemala? blörg! - the comedic attempts were pathetic. the funniest thing about the movie was probably its "action" and "suspense" scenes. they were horrible. no thrills. bad acting (can tommy lee jones make different faces or is he like derek zoolander?)... - and then there's the sci-fi stuff. no spoilers but it gets ridiculously and annoyingly weird.i usually don't write any comments on imdb but i thought the movie was so bad and disappointing that i felt compelled to share my opinion. but that's just me...

i see that c. thomas howell has appeared in many movies since his heyday in the 80s as an accomplished young actor.i bought this dvd because it was cheap and in part for the internet-related plot and to see how much older c. thomas howell is; i do not recall seeing him in any movies since the 1980s.in just a few words: what a very big disappointment. i give some low budget movies a chance, but this one started out lame. within the first 15 minutes of the movie, this elusive woman is chatting with an asian guy in a chatroom. they basically stimulate themselves to their own chat, she then insists on meeting the participant in person. she meets him, has sex, ties him up and then murders him in cold blood. the plot then deteriorates further.the plot is thin and flimsy and the acting is very stiff. do not bother renting it much less purchasing it, even if it is in the $1 dvd bin. i plan to take my copy of the dvd to goodwill. i am truly amazed that any of the prior reviewers here gave this movie a bad rating.

wow, i'd hate to sound opinionated, but anyone that rated this movie any higher than i just have must have an i.q. that reaches unimaginably low depths which reach out beyond time and space and connect at planet "hopper-is-a-retard-for-making-this-movie". wow this movie stank. fred ward's haircut looks sssssssttttttttttuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuupppppiiiddd! i actually considered mailing fred ward some money in compensation for that miserable haircut he owned in this awful film. jodie foster, of course didn't have much to work with but still manages a terrible performance throughout. joe pesci, oh my...joe pesci (who mysteriously is not cast) plays the ultimate stereotypical joe pesci movie character, complete with mob killing and constant use of the f word. you won't believe your eyes. dean stockwell, watching him in this mess made me feel bad for him because i actually thought he was either intoxicated or temporarily retarded throughout the course of the film. jon turturro must have been intoxicated himself when he agreed to be in this, along with vincent price, bob dylan, and charlie sheen. i know what you're thinking, great cast! i know, and it was the worst great cast film i've ever seen. dennis hopper directs and stars, and does equally bad in both areas. how the man could have directed easy rider and then this is far beyond my excellent imagination. his outrageously bad hit-man character accent is beyond the realms of horrendous, and only is equaled by the hilariously bad ending. they (hopper and foster) are the most uninteresting couple i believe that i have ever come across in my exposure to the world of cinema, and you will be cheering for them to lose and then be grandly maddened by the ending. what exactly are the two of them wearing at that action filled conclusion? i don't know, but i do know that if i ever meet dennis hopper, i will make immensely make fun of him for being responsible for this waste of celluloid. join me! ian

not as bad as 1992's "nails" (where hopper plays an "unstable" cop) but pretty bad. how can a movie with such a great cast go so wrong? this film manages to find a way. the story was pretty stupid and hopper's direction seemed like he had never directed before. all of the long shots in the beginning were bothersome. lots of meaningless scenes with a lot of meaningless dialogue.

"catchfire" or "backtrack" as it is sometimes called, is not very good. that is, it's bad. jodie foster had already won an oscar at this point. why did she agree to do this? i don't know.the hostage/kidnapper relationship is not believable, even if it is a common psychological phenomenon in real life.worst of all, this film features a scene where hopper and foster ride a boat under the fremont bridge (a bridge in seattle) which means that traffic had to stop so that the bridge could open. i've had to wait for that bridge to go down many times, almost all of them on the bus. it's not a pleasant wait. this film caused unnecessary bridge-waiting and the world is a worse place for it.

i watched this movie recently mainly because i am a huge fan of jodie foster's. i saw this movie was made right between her 2 oscar award winning performances, so my expectations were fairly high. unfortunately, i thought the movie was terrible and i'm still left wondering how she was ever persuaded to make this movie. the script is really weak. the story itself may have been somewhat believable if someone like mel gibson had played the role of the hit-man. the idea of jodie running off with dennis hopper and his irritating accent was impossible for me to buy into. i did think that jodie looked great throughout the movie, which was probably the only reason i watched the entire thing. maybe parading jodie around with as few clothes on as possible was the only reason the movie was made. i saw a tv biography of jodie where basically all of her movies were commented on in chronological order, and this movie was the only one never mentioned. after seeing it, i can now see why.

this movie has it all: it is a thriller, a chase movie, a romance story, a mob tale, a comedy, a road movie... well, in fact it's none of this at all. all the time you are waiting for something interesting to happen, but no, you are still watching the same dull, uninspiring and superficial cliché of a movie with a very bad soundtrack. even the star cast acting is lacking in credibility. a hit man with his quirks, a girl who's playing hard to get, mob guys acting tough and incapable cops, yawn...i'd recommend not to watch backtrack. if you want to see a good movie directed by a famous actor, go and see 'the three burials of melquiades estrada' by tommy lee jones. now, that's what i call worth watching.

a young woman, jodie foster, is witnessing a mafia murder, reports the killing to the local police, and becomes herself a hit target by the mob operatives. a professional killer, dennis hopper, hired by mafia, is stalking her to prepare for the hit, but eventually he falls for her. then, as a parody of the stockholm syndrome that defines a case when an abducted hostage begins to like and cooperate with the kidnapper, jodie foster falls for her abductor too, make love, and both prepare for a getaway.denis hopper, the actor, tries to align himself with the creative ambitions of dennis hopper, the director. the result is disappointing, and fails to keep pace with the artistic level of a great performer as dennis hopper is. there is no real thrill and the script is sometimes naive and predictable. the film is saved to some extent by the performance of jodie foster who is not at her best, but still shines with her talent, beauty and gift. of historical interest is the short appearance of vincent price, and, in a small act, of charlie sawn known from his great part in "wall street".if you decide to spend the 116 minutes to see the film, it is not a complete loss; this movie offers easy entertainment, but we would expect much more from the director of "easy rider", and the actress who gave us the character of sarah tobias in "the accused".

this movie really left me thinking ... but not about the plot, the direction, the characters, an underlying message, or a clever script. far from it. i was left wondering what in sam hill went wrong behind the scenes. clearly, something was badly amiss from the beginning.i'm amazed at the positive comments for the movie and for jodie foster's performance. from the get-go it was clear that foster had phoned this one in. one earlier comment even made a favorable mention of her facial expressions. i must have been watching a different movie since ms foster (usually a personal favorite) seemed to be totally disinterested.in one of his first scenes with foster, fred ward looks as though he, also, is distracted by her lack of energy and he struggles to deliver his own lines with any enthusiasm. by the time he's called upon to take part in a supposedly desperate search for runaway foster, ward also seems to have become embarrassingly half-hearted about the project.in my opinion, dennis hopper has always been a uni-dimensional performer, so i wasn't expecting much from him ... and he delivered.yes, this one left me thinking long after it ended. the fact that joe pesci and charlie sheen refused to have their names attached to the project suggests that this was a real stinker for everyone involved. but to then learn that the director preferred to hide behind a pseudonym speaks volumes.but why listen to me? i always think foster looks ridiculous in a dress, yet she's sensational in lacy underwear.

aaran is one of the movies where you find the loop holes in indian cinema. here is one good example to show how excellent writers, directors and actors succumb to the producers. here is one of the most wonderful actors, mohanlal, acting in a movie about a real story in kashmir. the seriousness of the film is slaughtered with sub standard comic scenes and songs. there is this character, havaldar jaykumar, who in reality, is the son of the producer of the film. hence, he doesn't have a hair cut despite his officer asking him to do so. this kid doesn't know what is acting and he is the "hero" of the movie. god help indian cinema with such producers.this movie is a pathetic display of what happens in kashmir. a sensible viewer can intuitively understand the constraints of such wonderful writers, actors and directors who want to share their real life experiences. but the unfortunate part is that a movie about the highest ranks in indian militia turns out to be a pathetic display that only makes one think that the movie was stupid.we should oust such producers in the film industry and pave way for good cinema.

i've seen this movie n i can say that this is really a bad movie. the director's gone nuts... of course.. he does know a lot about the army, but then he certainly is a cheap guy. there are a lotta technical flaws in the movies as well...okay... here's my doubt- in the end when they rescue the family (including a girl who was just raped)... why do they leave them there outside their place? i didn't see any ambulance around! there are a lot of aspects in the movie that are real... but then i just wish the major had narrated/helped/assisted some other good director n made the movie.mohanlal surely does deserve a better director!

the subject matter was good, direction was ok. mohanlal was efficient in his role as a major. the acting of the supporting actors was amateurish at best. the casting director and director should be held responsible for this debacle. hawaldar jai was terrible, he stood out like a sore thumb with his poor histrionics. he did not look the part nor did he move like a soldier. there was a scene where a satellite feed was required of the skirmish with the militants and they were showing it from a camera angle. satellite is located hundred of miles in the sky so the only angle is from above.it was quite an embarrassing moment. audience these days are matured and they recognize when one is trying to pull wool over their eyes. the director is a major so the story could be out of his personal experiences. no problem there, but the movie is only as good as its actors and director. so if major ravi is going for any other projects he should pay more attention to the casting.

i must have been in a good mood to give this shameful, predictable, embarrassing movie even a 3. what's wrong with it? let's start with the gratuitous sex although i admit the rotational style of bonking was something i had not seen (nor experienced) before. and i guess they also saved a few bucks by showing the same sex scene three times. then there are the inconsistencies. the "oakville tribune" seems to be in a green part of whatever town it was supposed to be. (hamilton ontario???) yet in the scenes on the roof, it appears to be in an industrial area with a steel mill belching smoke and flames. also, the inside of the building --- the newsroom --- the stairways --- seem much bigger than the outside. spoilers here then, when our intrepid reporter finally gets fired, she comes back to the building several times, once after hours. hardly likely. the ending is also pitifully predictable...the classic bait and switch caper in which the good guy turns out to be the bad guy. but my major objection is the fact this is yet another movie financed with canadian and ontario tax credits which is ashamed to set itself in canada, yet again proving that the canadian film industry is craven and opportunistic. a country's movies must do more than just provide jobs. they should reflect the culture. it's bad enough that the american studios use toronto as a stand in for new york. but it is embarrassing and infuriating when canadian producers (in this case, canwest global) do it with help from the federal and provincial governments. in a word... bah!

***spoilers*** ***spoilers*** there's not much that can be said about this early-talkie era flick. (i'm hesitant to call "cimarron" a "film", because i feel that the word is too esoteric.) but what can be said about it...mainly speaks against it.take, for example, the overuse of portraying indians as bad folk. in one scene, the little boy of the flick's lead character--an overbearing and over-ambitious family man who wants to set up a newspaper business-- is playing just outside of his father's office. an indian kneels down in front of the child. "hello," the boy says to the indian, in a very polite manner. the indian gives him a feather, stands up and walks off.yancy cravat, jr. excitedly runs inside the office. "mommy! mommy!" he shouts, holding up the indian's gift. "look what an indian gave me!""how many times do i have to tell you!" she snaps at the boy. "you aren't ever to talk to those filthy indians!"yancy yates, sr. (richard dix) comes across as a man who speaks with a forked tongue. at the start of the story, he seems to have a definite plan for giving his family a better life. but, we soon enough discover, he's no great over achiever--much less a totally good-moral minded man. his slave child, isaiah (eugene jackson) is one tell-tale sign of this.upon his family's first trek to a sunday morning church service--oneat which, curiously enough, cravat is to give the sermon--isaiah tries to come along, dressed up like cravat, long-tail suit, holster, gun and all. cravat tells him to go home. "ya' all doesn't want me to come with ya' ta church?" isaiah says with a pout."no!" cravat corrects him, patting him on the shoulder. "you don't understand! i want you to stay and guard the house. and if anyone at all comes along... you shoot him dead!"the characters--not to mention the actors--in "cimarron" couldn'tact their way out of burlap sacks, despite their obvious efforts. and nothing in the script was any too commendable, either. (granted: the incomparable edna may oliver--notorious for playing the red queen in alice in wonderland, also released in 1931--actually manages to look good, pulling off her portrayal of a pompous old woman, which is what she's also been best-known for.) but, aside from that, well...yancy yates isn't popular in town from the first week he arrives,and one of the outlaws decides to shoot cravat's white hat off as he and his wife (irene dunne) are casually walking by. despite her anger with the man who fired the bullet, cravat just takes it completely in stride.not only was this story not "shooting for realism", but it was verylacking in several key areas: e.g., cravat's newspaper isn't ever really seen. (bulletins and posters, yes--but not any newspaper.)perhaps strangest of all, though: this is set in a small town inkansas. yet, for some reason or other, yancy cravat is dead-set oncalling his paper "the oklahoma wig-wam."really good westerns have always been very few and far between--the only exceptions being clint eastwood's so-called "spaghetti westerns" of the late '60s to early '70s. cliche westerns, on the other hand, are a dime-a-dozen.if you like cliche westerns, "cimarron" will do you proud--but, as for me... it did me embarrassment.

this movie was, of the 67 of 71 best pictures i have seen, by far the worst. first of all, i found the plot line somewhat absurd - the absent husband for 25 years/ still in love/ not even a letter! give me a break. and why was the guy who was absent for so long coincidentally working on an oil rig next door to the congress-woman's party? this film also exhibited some of the worst stereotyping of african-americans that i have ever seen. it makes gone with the wind (see prissy) look downright progressive! i have scarcely seen a movie that i disliked this much. ugh!

the selection of the bloated, boring, and racist "cimarron" ranks as the worst choice for best picture in oscar history. poorly acted (particularly by the justly forgotten richard dix, whose performance as the self-centered and irresponsible yancey cravat ranks as one of the most narcissistic characterizations in screen history) and leadenly paced, the film is truly shocking today because of the racist slant towards its one black character, who is introduced by being shown sleeping in a chandelier.other comments by imdb reviewers have dismissed the attitude towards this character as being merely dated, but many films that appeared during this period did not depict blacks as shuffling, lazy mental deficients in the manner that this behemoth takes great delight in; so that argument seems weak to say the least. but whether you regard this demeaning characterization as in shockingly bad taste for anyone at any time or merely the forgivable ignorance of a less-educated era, it is very painful to watch with 21st century eyes.but even this might not matter if the film weren't the overlong bore that it is. voted the best picture oscar at the 1930/31 academy awards when such enduring classics as "city lights," "the public enemy," "dracula," "the dawn patrol" and "the blue angel" failed to be nominated, "cimarron" is by far the worst selection to join the oscar pantheon.

like a lot of films from the early sounds days, cimarron must be viewed more for historical interest than as compelling entertainment. the hammy acting of lead richard dix, nominated for best actor, can be excused as a relic of the silent-film school of acting. however, even giving benefits of the doubt, cimarron is a badly shaped piece of drama -- a bloated film that moves from unrelated sequence to unrelated sequence with little dramatic impact. offically, the film is two hours and four minutes; it feels like four hours when you're watching it. there is no reason to waste your time on it unless you want to see every best picture winner or have a keen interest in the early sound days. in my opinion, cimarron is the worst choice for best picture in academy history and the award should have gone to city lights or little ceasar. cimarron is barely remembered today, and would have be remembered at all if not for its oscar win.

cimarron was painful to sit through. although irene dunn does a good job with the heavy-handed script, richard dix' pompous and overacted role is brutal. the passage of time has not treated the character of isaiah, as well as other racial and religious notions, well, although the movie is somewhat progressive on the roles of women and the mistreatment of native americans. the editing is especially weak. this is, without a doubt, the worst of all the "best" pictures.

this movie is dated in so many ways, it's sensational. you can either laugh at it or shake your fists in rage.this movie deals with many problems of american history, but with the typical white-male-christian-american paternalism: the main character is one of those i-can-do-it-all-and-you've-got-to-love-me-for-it-kind-of-guy. he is so pompous and not to be taken serious at any time. what a horrid creature! his wife is a weak little woman for the first part of the movie and a still very weepy, but stronger character in the end. too bad she still forgives his cocky ways after he's left her for the second time. it's just sad that the character didn't really change at all. even though she is supposed to portray a strong and independent woman in the end, she is consumed by worry about her adventure-seeking husband. so 2 out of 10 points from the feminists among us (and those are only for the good intentions...)! the problem of indian suppression is dealt with quite nicely, but there is that patronizing story-telling again. and the fact that all african-american characters are the typical stereotypes makes the movie even more hypocritical. i was so enraged most of the time! so one point (for trying) from the civil rights movement.i know, that the movie was done at a different time. i love old movies and i have a lot of patience with some of those dated point of views. but this was just disgusting!what saves this movie are the parts without the main character. mr dix's acting is way over the top and smug. maybe that's why his character is so disagreeable... i liked mrs dunne's performance, even though her character enraged me at times. but i must say the famous land rush scene was incredibly done. and the way that the oklahoma settlement was portrayed made the movie worthwhile. it's just amazing how civilization rose out of the dirt and dust of the 19th century. and i don't understand the problem some have with that church scene. i thought it was quite funny and amusing. maybe it wasn't supposed to be, but i liked it. so 9 points for those scenes and the impressive storytelling of the development of the oklahoma state. that makes about 4 points altogether!

not all films made in 1931 are this creaky, and the fact that this was "best picture" must have given even greater impetus to the development of television.typical of all ferber novels, it isn't possible to bring the entire story to the screen, to say nothing of developing character. dix -- so stolid in the first third of the movie -- does an about face, but no one knows why and it makes no sense. and what is there about dunne that makes makes her so stoical? edna may oliver's scenes are priceless, as usual.this film has a role to play in the history of cinema, but it is long and boring.

i'm glad this was the last of the '40's universal mummy movies. the movies were all of variating qualities and this movie was definitely one of the lesser ones.problem is that it's a very slow moving movie, in which basically nothing interesting or exciting is ever happening. perhaps it would had all been better if the mummy had made his entrance earlier on in the movie. instead now the movie once again spends its first 20 minutes explaining what had all happened in the previous mummy movies, by also once again using archive footage from this time "the mummy" from 1932 again, to which this movie is the fourth mummy movie following the 1932 mummy story. the movie just never knows to find the right pace and even though the movie is barely over an hour long, it still feels a bit like a drag.it of course also doesn't help that the movie has a rather simplistic and actually very little interesting story. the movie also feels quite disjointed. the first and second half of the movie don't really connect to each other and they seemed like two separate movies on their own.at least lon chaney jr. is still in it. he once more reprises the role of the mummy kharis, for the third time. too bad that he has such limited screen time this time. he gets unfortunately very little interesting to do, which is also a big waste of the mummy character itself. the movie is further more filled with dozens of silly actors who are playing around with silly accents. it seemed so totally unnecessary to me that most of the characters had to speak with such an accent and it actually gets quite distracting and annoying at points.the mummy movies that's least worth seeing.4/10

the mummy's curse is the last in the series of the kharis mummy films, and it seems that creativity had run somewhat dry by the time they made this one. kharis and his mate ananka both end up in the bayous of louisiana, and on his resurrection, he searches out his beloved princess. how they end up in louisiana isn't made entirely clear, but with various people trying to find them, the viewer can be assured of some mummy murders.the mummy's curse was watchable, but it really wasn't anything special. i had the feeling throughout the movie that i'd seen this before. quite frankly, apart from the original the mummy with boris karloff, the mummy movies are not my favorites among the old universal horrors. they're not bad, but they do get a bit repetitive.there are some great scenes in the movie (the scene with ananka coming to life in the swamp for instance) but overall this didn't do much for me.it's worth seeing if you want to be completest and see all of the mummy movies, but otherwise you might want to pass on this one.

unfortunately, this film is typical of the watering down of a good film by numerous sequels. universal made several serial monster films in the 1940s, which were pale imitations of the original. the intelligent egyptologist imhotep has been replaced by a leg-dragging frankenstein in mummy wrappings, who exhibits no signs of intelligent life. this film is entertaining in spots but if you have seen the mummy (1932), you will be disappointed.

this is not exactly what i would call a mad max film, after seeing road warrior and experiencing the excellence of that film, i felt somewhat disappointed after seeing this. it supposedly started out as some kind of kids in the wilderness film, and was merged with the mad max franchise(bad idea). the casting was not exactly the best, i mean come on tina turner? one of the main problems with this film is that there are no good villains. no wez, no humungus, not even a decent toecutter! nothing really even happens, if you are going to plan on seeing this sub par action flick (can it even be called that?) make sure you see mad max 2 or mad max, or better yet both. another problem with this film is that there are too many people, even the thunderdome battle sequence is dull, max doesn't even kill anyone! the music is bad, the characters are bad (not in the good way) and after seeing this film, it left a very bad taste in my mouth.

i feel terribly sorry! where the lubitsch-pic was enchanting, marvelous, full of spirit and elegance, this one here is only - colored! lana looks like 51 (in fact she was 31 at that time, but obviously depressive) and tries to play a shy and dull girlie. think of jeanette mcdonald, who gave the role of the widow a double-faced depth by "playing" with count danilo. that lana had to play an operetta although unable to sing - crazy! she only sings one song - the title role of an lehar-operetta, that is really funny! the only really good thing is the great waltz scene at the end: glamorous! and - after watching this scene - have a look at the introducing waltz scene in "gentlemen prefer blondes"! any similarities?

my wife and i met doing a professional production of "the merry widow" in 1982 -- in english, but a straight translation.only the very basic skeleton of the original plot is visible in this "adaptation". most of the characters have been deleted, along with the entire b plot, and all but one of the characters remaining have been renamed. most of the characters in the movie aren't in the operetta, either. the action has been moved from paris to, at first, washington, dc, and then to the fictional country of pontevedro, which the movie has renamed "marshovia", and only later to paris. the net result is that we don't reach the beginning of the original play until about 45 minutes in.and the main source of tension in the plot is deleted, too. in the original, years before, count danilo and the heroine were very much in love, but his family refused to allow them to marry because she was poor; it's his broken heart that has rendered him a careless playboy. now that, as a widow, she's the richest woman in the world, she still loves him, and he still loves her, but his pride won't let him admit it to anyone, even himself, and she must spend three acts playing mind games to break him down. the trope of the aristocrat with money problems who won't admit that he's in love with a rich woman for fear of what people will think supplied the main plots of a substantial fraction of viennese operettas for decades after the 1906 "widow". in this movie, they've never met before, which rips out not only the heart of the whole thing, but nearly all the comedy.lamas does a pretty decent job, though.an interesting musical point is that several times we hear a snippet or so of "trés parisien", an extra song written (in english, despite the title) for the london première, which was not, as far as i know, usually found in american productions until the 1980s or so.

okay. i really tried to tap into the (so called) silly & surreal humor that this film sets out to be. i'm told that the japanese version of this film is much shorter than the one shipped to america (go figure!), and has less political references. apart from all that, i found this sexual/political farce just as boring and pointless as standard porn. the central female lead is easy on the eyes, and could actually act. i would love to see her in a non pink film where she could actually flex her acting muscles (and no,not the ones you're thinking of). it's obvious that japan can (and does)produce just as much crap as other countries. i couldn't recommend this to anyone, with the distant possibility of someone who has a jones for asian porn. go see a real japanese film.

it would be quite easy to make this movie sound fun: a call girl gets shot in the forehead by a north korean spy, but survives. the bullet that is embedded in her brain makes her long for knowledge, as well as sex. unbeknownst to her, she walks away from the shooting with the cloned finger of george w. bush in her purse, a key which can unlock the power to use nuclear armaments. just call it a romp, and at least a few people will show up to the theater. i'm not sure how many did go to see this four year old film when it opened in new york this past april, but i sincerely hope not many. it sounds like a light and playful pinku flick, but it has art-house pretensions and is really just incredibly boring. many pinku films in the past have been successful in their artistic aspirations, but this film's aspirations just make the time that elapses between the sex scenes excruciating. and then the sex scenes aren't even good! i've seen some pretty outrageous stuff in dirty japanese movies. i've never seen this country produce something with sex this dull. the spice channel is more imaginative. the only worthwhile thing in this movie is the body of the lead actress, emi kuroda. otherwise, this is pure torture.

watched this piece ondemand because the description was kind of outlandish. this film stinks of cocaine, the opening scene alone must have cost at least five figures in blow to film. this is a racist, homophobic piece of garbage that plods along for a good 1hr and 22mins with absolutely no direction. i am a little confused on how this has good reviews here. i won't bother telling you the plot line because as far as i can tell there is no plot. i'm pretty sure everyone showed up to the set everyday did giant lines, dressed loretta switt in plunging necklines to show as much flapjack breastage as possible and yelled action; letting the cast improvise in a cocaine frenzy. much like real beer this movie nearly caused my liver to fail half way through. save your money, and watch 'strange brew' instead.

i kind of like jag. it do have it´s charm but lately it´s to much propaganda in it. for an outsider (a non american) the patriotic feeling can be a bit to much.i don´t like that rabb and mackenzie goes from being lawyers (as they were in the early parts of the tv show) to become super heros that stops wars and rescues entire continents. its almost like watching a recruitment video from the us army.i still watch the show, so it´s not that bad. but i would prefer more episodes when rabb and mackenzie investigates military accidents and don´t save the world in the future.

this movie, which i just discovered at the video store, has apparently sit around for a couple of years without a distributor. it's easy to see why. the story of two friends living in new york searching for their pal from high school who is now living homeless under the boardwalk at coney island, has flashes of being a very good film, but ultimately is weighted down by the story focusing on stan and daniel, rather than on their homeless friend richie. cryer is as usual very good and the film has a nice stark look to it, with the ghostly images of coney island. however, writer cryer and director richard schenkman are too busy dealing with the fairly uninteresting lives of stan and daniel rather than focusing on richie. one flashback in a music store, where richie has a crush on an employee stands out and really shows the viewer where this film could have gone. but in the end, not much. two many drawn out scenes of annoyance, such as inside the skeeball building. rating 4 out of 10.

i saw this movie when it was first released in 1986. at the time i was young and enjoyed all the normal comedy available, i.e.; monty python, jim belushi & snl, steve martin, cheech & chong, so i believe that my judgment represents most "sane" individuals.the absolute best part of this movie was the trailer played at the beginning of the movie for the new "my little pony" movie that was coming out.this movie was so atrocious that it was actually yanked from most theaters before the initial week run was completed.i'm surprised that anyone would waste there corporate money to duplicate this steaming pile of human waste.don't waste your time or money to rent or watch this "movie".

this is one of the stupidest movies ever, not the stupidest mind you but one of the stupidest. this is 96 1/2 minutes of sleep inducing material. probably jim varney's worst movie ever. the last 30 seconds of the film is the best and funniest part but hardly worth sitting through the whole movie for. on the other hand, if you are a die hard jim varney/ernest fan, then like me, you must add this film to your collection. it does have brief, rare moments of humor, although they are few and far between. the mere fact that this movie is so hard to find makes it a collectors item and a must have for your ernest collection. i was lucky to find this film online at a dirt cheap price a couple years ago. i believe i paid 1.99 plus shipping for it. and it was the only copy i could find anywhere. even though this is a truly all around horrible movie, it is still a must have if you are a jim varney fan and an ernest movie collector such as i. on a scale of 1 to 10 i give this movie a 2 but thats only because i've never seen a 1 before ;)

my website (www.theflickguy.org) lists this pick as the worst movie of all time. here is an excerpt: "if i were strapped down to a chair and forced to watch this movie over and over again, i couldn't imagine hell being any worse. jim varney plays a three-handed crazy guy bent on destroying the world (apparently starting with cinema). now let's face it, no one expects a whole lot from a varney movie, but this agonizing drivel had me dry-heaving for 92 minutes. not a laugh. not one. this is not kamp or gitchy, this is not even mindless. it is evil. do not rent this, it may destroy your dvd player. do not even buy the vhs from a 29-cent clearance bin to use as a blank tape. it is the worst film of all time. period. i mean it. really."

this is a bad film, as its central message is very muddled and the plot seems like it was the result of merging several disparate scripts. as a result, it often makes absolutely no sense at all and certainly is not a film miss dunne or mr. huston should have been proud of making. however, the film is worth watching if you are a fan of "pre-code" films because it features an amazingly sleazy plot that strongly says that nice girls do put out--even if they aren't married and even if their partner is!! the film begins with miss dunne as a social worker assisting troops heading to europe for wwi. in the process, she meets a scalawag (bruce cabot) who eventually convinces her to sleep with him. she becomes pregnant and he then goes on to the next unsuspecting woman. however, miss dunne does not want him back, as she realizes he's not worth it, but later her baby dies at child birth. while all these very controversial plot elements are used, they are always alluded to--almost like they wanted the adults in the audience to know but hoped that if they phrase it or film it in just the right way, kids in the audience will be clueless (after all, films were not rated and kids might attend any film at this time).surprisingly, this entire plot involving a stillborn baby and cabot ends about 1/4 of the way through the film and is never mentioned again or alluded to. it was as if they filmed part of a movie and abandoned it--tacking it on to still another film. in this second phase of the film, miss dunne unexpectedly begins working at a women's prison (though we actually never really get to see her doing anything there). what we do see are countless horrible scenes of severe abuse and torture that were probably designed to titillate. and, as a result of all this violence, miss dunne goes on a crusade to clean up the prison and becomes a reformer and famous writer.but then, out of the blue, another type of film emerges and the women's prison reform business goes by the wayside. dunne meets a judge (walter huston) who is married but he desperately wants her. now throughout the film, dunne is portrayed as a very good girl--even though she did have unmarried sex with cabot (she was more or less tricked into it). but now, single irene, who is a tireless reformer and good lady begins sleeping with a married man. he tells her that he and his wife are estranged and are married in name only, but she never thinks to investigate if this is true, and with his assurance, off flies her clothes and they are in the baby making business! but, while she's pregnant with his love child, he's indicted for being a crooked judge. he assures her he's innocent, but he's convicted and it sure sounds like he's a scoundrel--using inside information from people that have come before his bench in order to amass a fortune. then, in the final moments of the film, miss dunne tries in vain to get him freed and vows to wait with the child until huston is released. the film then ends.so, we basically have three separate films and a bizarre early 30s idea of what a nice girl should be like. i gathered that she should be a strong-minded working girl who instantly becomes an idiot in her personal relationships! this really undoes all the positives about dunne's character and it's really hard to imagine anyone liking the film. a strong women's rights advocate might easily be offended at how weak-minded and needy she was and religious people might see her as totally amoral or at least morally suspect! with a decent re-write, this could have been a good film or at least interesting as a lewd and salacious film, but it couldn't make up its mind what it wanted to be and was just another dull pre-code film.

some famous stories are prone to being moved to another epoch and, as such, becoming an embarrassing tv-movie. oscar wilde's canterville ghost is one of them. this tv movie for kids is utterly cheap, concerning acting, character work, credibility, directing and even concerning the modest special effects. as often, the question arises: what was this made for?

i watched this movie by accident on tv and it was so unbelievably awful i could not switch it off. every single piece of wit and intelligence has been removed from the oscar wilde story by the inept screenplay writer. it barely matters because the dire acting, clichéd camera-work and cloying music would have ruined anything resembling like a decent script anyway. the worst performance comes from patrick stewart who comes across as the most hammy, talentless, minor mock-shakespearean nincompoop as the ghost. "get thee out of here!" he screams at one stage while waving his arms like a pantomime villain. a truly terrible film and why wonders why stewart, who can act when called upon to do so, has soiled his reputation by making worthless pieces of crap like this and the xmen.

i was really excited when i read "the canterville ghost" would be shown on tv. however, i was deeply disappointed. i loved the original story written by oscar wilde and sadly nothing of that was transferred by the movie.

there's a certain irony in a parody of the gothic genre being turned into a mess of clichés by filmmakers who either had no idea what the story's purpose was, or just didn't care. all of the hallmarks of your average family film are present- rambunctious younger siblings, a grumpy teenager who doesn't want to move, unsympathetic parents who are unable to see the apparition, and of course a romantic subplot. the movie has very little in common with wilde's original story, which was largely written to poke fun at the melodramatic gothic novellas that were all the rage at the time. if wilde saw this version, he'd probably laugh- and then of course, write a parody. one can only hope that the children who watched this bland, mass-produced pap eventually discovered the wit and sparkle of the original version.

...but it definitely still only deserves 4/10 stars and no more. a moronic dumb kid's father is a fighter pilot who gets shot down by some arab country. they never name the country in the movie, its really ridiculous, they just vaguely refer to some arab nation, this movie is really ignorant like that. but lamar from revenge of the nerds is in here, he is friends with the main character doug masters. well, doug masters, who lives on an air force base, his father is an air force pilot, yet he fails to get into the air force academy, conceives of a plot (with help from his retarded friends) to steal two jets and go rescue his father. yea, exactly - this is one of the greatest films ever made!!! louis gossett jr is fantastic in his role. you can tell he basically wanted to smack the hell out of doug masters the whole movie. well anyway, you can probably guess how the plot ends, i can't believe they made 3 sequels to this movie.

i remember watching this for the first time in the 80's as a teen. man, i've read the reviews on this trash and i find myself astonished by the voting. this movie does not deserve four stars!!! this movie is not better than topgun. topgun has its own problems; don't get me wrong. this movie should be banned just for its own stupidity. so many stereotypes, so many loop holes, so much poor dialog. i cannot think of one redeeming quality of this vomit. this is not action/adventure. this is a bad joke on film. kinda like watching plan 9 with stock f-16 footage. this movie not only defies logic and common sense within the context of a military setting, it sends a disturbing message. the military is not going to save your dad from the imminent evil of the middle east b*****ds. so go out there and hijack a multi-million dollar weapon and blast him out of the sinister clutches of the backwards, anti-american arabs. cuz you can't reason with those animals. this is a bruckheimer flick without a budget. bland direction, weak acting, lame music, idiotic plot, equals...iron eagle.

a teen-age boy, who is not in the military and has not trained to be a jet pilot, takes off for a foreign country to rescue his dad. if this is not ridiculous enough, he talks a colonel in the air force into helping him get his hands on a jet [wow!]. to make the picture even more absurd, the colonel risks his career and life by giving the spunky lad some hands on aid. they not only don't make colonels like this anymore, but they never did. this sappy, corny film should be tossed into the air and blown away by a mig.

i liked this move when i was a kid, but now that i'm older i can see how absurd the plot really is. in case you didn't read the earlier reviews it's about a teenager and an air force colonel who steal two fully loaded f-16s to rescue said teenager's dad.it does have some nice aerial stunts, even if the dialog accompanying then is basically teckno babel.some unintentional humor in the edited for tv version. when the hero's dad is being held by iran, err i mean an unnamed country, and his captors ask him for a confession (relating to why he's being held, don't worry about exactly why, or what they want him to confuse to.) he says "tell him he can take my confession and shove it down his throat.". however his lips and, more importunely, his gesture make it clear what motion, and part of the anatomy, he was really thinking of.

the reason why i gave this movie a 4 was for a couple reasons, but this movie was not that bad. first off, the editing i found too be pretty poor at times, the script(or what they had of one) was not very good, and if not for nunzio la bianca, the acting would have been crap. but all that aside(ha ha i know its like the whole movie) its not that bad for an extremely low ind. , low budget film. if they would have gotten more money, a little better actors(but these ones were intimidating so it was good) and a little more detailed script this movie would be terrific. somebody has to tell me this guy was influenced a lot by the warriors by walter hill. i mean this movie is exactly like it. anyone who has seen both those films will agree with me.

this film could have been great- but wasn't. amongst the cesspool of talentless no-hopers and friends of the film makers who wanted to help out there are some mild inklings of talent. the main star of the film plays a good lead role. he is convincing and has those scary italian eyes. however, he is teamed up with the worst rejects of actors anyone has ever come across. the opening scenes of the film are among the worst and most embarrassing. it looks like gay porno. fortunately no one stripped off. the rape scene that keeps being mentioned is rubbish. the prison sequence was the best part of the film- although irrelevant. the movies soundtrack (if you can call it that) sounds like a teenage boys first attempt at using cooledit and some sample cds. it is boring, repetitive and extremely lame. in fact the whole film is lame. get out while you still can!

i'm not prone to ranting and my expectations were low to start with, but how did this seem like a good idea? just because you have a camera, some big ugly friends for actors, and delusions of talent, does not mean that you should go out and make a film. this should have been the cinematic equivalent of singing in the shower, i.e. it should never have seen the light of day. however, somehow this rubbish found a distributor to help it escape the confines of a 3 by 4 foot cubicle. it goes from bad to worse. talk about low budget, one torture scene consists of a guy getting a mug of coffee thrown over him while he's tied to a chair. evidently this is very painful because the big baby proceeds to scream in agony....maybe he ordered decaf!! the acting is worse than wooden (i could possibly watch a tree for 30 seconds before becoming completely bored, if you can look at this rubbish for that long you're a better man than i!) and the fight scenes would be at home on a kindergarten play yard. do not touch this movie, unless you enjoy pain (in which case you should try spilling lukewarm coffee over yourself). i'd like to say it's so bad it's good, but really this is just awful.

this film follows a very similar storyboard to the warriors, only with less intensity and rather poor acting which is nothing to write home about.the story in general is not that bad, based around a small aussie gang who are trying to get out of the city when one of their members is framed for the rape of another gang's girl. they then have to fight their way through the streets whilst they are been hunted down by a number of rival gangs. on could assume that the writers have taken a page out of the warriors book and re-written it, but as mentioned above - with not nearly as much intensity.the acting as a whole is not very good in my opinion, and it's clearly obvious on many occasions that they are indeed acting... the fight scenes make up for this however but then the poor sound effects that go with them bring it back down.this film has nothing on once were warriors.low budget, alright story, poor acting, nothing to write home about.

this film proves a theory i have had for quite some time - in australia, as long as a film deals with the right topic, it will be a success regardless of how terrible it is. aussie park boyz could not possibly be any worse - the acting is beyond terrible, the plot is basically a poor warriors knock-off, and the filmmakers clearly have no idea about ethnic gangs in australia (an irish gang in twenty-first century sydney! the last time any irish gangs were in australia was about a hundred years ago in the time of the tinkers!) but because it's about ethnic rivalry, one of four topics guaranteed to be a success in australian cinema (along with struggling families, minority groups, and the biography of a famous australian) it won multiple academy awards. i've always suspected that australian critics will lap up any rubbish that deals with these issues, but part of me thought, or at least hoped, that they had their limits. this film proves otherwise. so to all you australian aspiring film-makers out there, don't bother putting thought into your film or choosing people who can actually act, or even getting your facts right - just write a script about some poor family trying to make ends meet, or someone of a foreign race coming to australia and having to deal with racial prejudice and stereotypes, or, if you want to take a leaf out of these people's book, some ethnic gang fighting some other ethnic gang that isn't actually plausible in the period the film is set, and your film will win five academy awards regardless of how pathetic it is!

within about 5 minutes in to the film the first fight scene i was watching i just could help but pointout the lack of tension in the scene the cameras crossing back and forth really shows he had no idea what he was doing, well actually the soundtrack shows that the best. i no its a low budget film and your not going to get top 40 songs but at least get music that goes with the scene that isn't actually that hard acting, well if i saw any i would gladly let you know. the script was so badly written would now surprise me one bit of the guy directing wrote this piece of beep, i will give the person one 10/10 and that was for the dvd cover because if i actually saw "before watching this" in a shop and it was like 10 15 bucks i would have bought it, why well if you look at the front cover this actually well done you flip over to the back and you see that it has actually won awards. now that is a very misleading thing because even in a small film festival i wouldn't ever believe in my life that this would win anything all i can say is "wow if this was the best i wouldn't want to know what the crap in the film festival was like"films that are this bad only have one good use and that is for a aspiring film maker to use as inspiration films like this are better tools then good films, because with good film you almost know off the bat there is a good chance you wont make a film that good, but if you use a film like this you can look at all the things they director or writer did wrong so you wont make the same mistakes, and you have the added plus of looking at this film and saying if a piece of beep like this can get made then there is hope of anyone out there

everything about this movie is awful.you can tell in the first five minutes that this movie is going to be terrible. you can't however, gauge how bad it's going to be.we start the movie with a seemingly endless intro scene aided with gay music and no dialogue. having the camera move up and down big guys who are trying too hard to look like mentals doesn't provoke the slightest emotion.what then starts seems to be one of two separate stories. the first half of the movie consists of the wogs going around competing in paid, midnight fights with other ethnic groups. the wogs always win of course, because they apparently lift weights and have "respect". it is in these scenes that we first get to see the degree of bad acting, editing, scripting and hatred for the people who funded this film.eventually the main character and his mate get sent to prison. the entire prison part of the movie is unrelated to what i assume is the plot, and consists of a bunch of fights.once out of prison(3 years for murder?) the main character and his mate reunite with the wogs. they then go to the "other side of town" and try to lay low, because apparently everyone wants to kill them.soon the wogs get set up for the rape of another gang members girl , and run around town fighting off hordes of different gangs. this point of the movie can be compared to an arcade game, as the wogs simply run around and fight off enemies who seemingly get worse and worse as the movie goes on.anyway the movie ends with some massive climatic fight scene in which the remaining wogs (the two main characters) take on every gang they've fought so far. apparently the other gangs don't have a problem uniting to take on the remaining wogs(the skinheads don't mind asians). after about a million more people get beaten up by the invincible wog brothers the movie ends with the main characters heading home. they don't make it home however, because they are burned to death by the the thousands of angry film critics who storm the set and leave angry letters everywhere.this movie may be more like a computer game then a movie, because that would explain how two guys can take about a million punches to the face from a million different people who the majority of the time are twice their size.there are also tonnes more stupid unexplainable events in this movie, such as an asian fighting off his own gang and taking a katana to the head just to let the wogs get away.like someone else mentioned, this movie isn't so bad its funny, it's just so bad.

how does this movie suck? as a fan of michael imperioli's work on the sopranos i picked this up at blockbuster based on his name and a story that sounded like it had promise. it still does, but this movie doesn't fulfill it.every turn of the story is entirely predictable; i kept looking for the lifetime bug on the bottom right corner of the screen. it's all there: the noble woman coming out of hard times, the guy failing to live up to his potential despite her best efforts, the kid who gets stuck in the middle, etc., etc., etc. the mysterious stranger's identity is what really made me want to throw stuff at the tv -- i would have been more satisfied with little stuey waking up and realizing it was all a dream.the filmmakers may as well have had a "the moral of the story is..." bit before the credits, since as another reviewer pointed out this thing really does roll like an afterschool special. don't gamble, don't drink, don't do drugs, stay with your wife, spend time with your kids...come on, how about a little nuance? how about some interesting bad guys? writer/director a.w. vidmer should be singled out for special notice: not only is the dialogue leaden, the pacing (within dialogue and at either end of many scenes) makes this movie at least 45 minutes longer than it needs to be (and believe me, it feels like longer). the talents of imperioli, renee faia and some of the supporting cast (steve schirripa, natch) are the only things that keep this from a "1" rating. all of their good work is nearly offset, though, by the atrocious job of portraying the boy stuey. not sure if it was a casting mistake (hey -- it's a mob movie, so let's cast someone from blue's clues who can't do anything but over-overact with a big fake grin...next let's cast the sullen, brooding kid in the disney flick) or just awful directing but those scenes are really painful to watch.i'd be interested in another filmmaker's take on this character and his story; it's a shame imperioli has already been used up by this flick. awful, awful, awful.

stu ungar is considered by many to be the greatest poker / gin player of all time - an extraordinary self-destructive force of nature - tiny in stature, but a huge heart for the game.what we have here is a kind of hallmark film about the dangers of gambling. sure, he wins, he loses, he blows it all on sex, drugs, and more gambling we get it, but where is the real play - where is what made him the greatest card player of all time.much too flat, and frankly boring in places, this gets a four because we get to learn something about stu the man, but stu the card player, nada.nicely shot and presented up to a point this is the perfect example of how not to make a film about cards: honestly, espn's coverage of the world series is more watchable than this.a waste of a great chance.

this movie attempted to make stu ungar's life interesting by being creative. what they forgot is that his life was plenty entertaining enough on it's own without having to make things up.a short list of the inaccuracies: 1) stuey was not sent straight to las vegas for a gin tournament to pay off old debts, he spent a good deal of time in florida first, and only went to las vegas when he ran out of gin games on the east coast.2) stuey never associated (or played gin) with a casino executive (like the one played by pat morita in the movie.) 3) there was no magical turnaround in the buildup to the 1997 wsop. in fact stuey barely made it into the tournament as it was. he snorted cocaine the week before even.either tell the story right, or don't tell it at all. 4 out of 10 stars for michael imperolli's credible performance (the only redeeming quality of this movie.)

this movie is a shameful result of what happens when:a) it is written, directed and produced by an idiot. and/or b) it was rushed in production to satiate the poker/stu ungar craze. the story from beginning is uneven. vidmer spends too much time on ungar's childhood and not enough on some of the legendary tales -- such as counting cards, his blackjack escapades, the roll of money as id. he also leaves out mentions of other poker greats such as chip reese, brunson etc. the movie is a complete mess from beginning to end. if you want a more complete and accurate account, read the book one of a kind. if you thought the movie was good, read the book and change your mind.

a really wonderful cast and very talented technical crew wasted their valuable career time, and our equally valuable leisure time, by bothering to support this utterly predictable and plainly formulaic piece of commercial junk. the movie is based upon a really good and very topical idea but both the producers and the director simply applied the standard hollywood 'disaster movie' formula and thereby ruined any potential value from the production.an unusually high tide and very strong gale conditions combine to produce a record high storm surge that overwhelms london and floods most of the thames valley. the plot centers around a heroic scientist (tom courtenay) who alerts the authorities of the danger and ultimately saves the day, a glamorous female police chief who runs the entire show and an embattled deputy prime minister (david suchet) who tries to look important.but it's all so unreal that one feels like an extended tea break after just 30 minutes. the young glamorous female police commissioner demands complete authority over the army during a declared state of emergency and gets it (as if!). the experienced general is just pushed aside like a complete moron who has to lick her boots because of her obviously superior capacity. the trouble is that our female supremo, whilst now responsible for millions of lives, spends most of her time worrying over the fate of her two daughters who have taken a trip to south west london and haven't telephoned to say they were alright. so our mighty woman sets her staff to look for them and decides that the sole priority for all the army and the rescue services must be south west london and not any other quarter of the city. of course the minister, the army and the entire entourage accept her prioritization without question. one can only assume they all had property there. when her children are eventually found after endless reports and efforts by her staff she is told by our male hero, 'thank god they're safe, that's the main thing'. never mind about the millions of others or all the other responsibilities she was supposed to control; as long as her own kids were safe everything was alright. this film is just another excuse to push the same old female chauvinist sexist clap trap that women are the clever, mindful, caring and clearly able leaders whilst men are good for nothing except physical bravery, mindless strength and very specialist knowledge. and yet the one simple instruction that she could have given the populace; namely to go to the nearest tall building and calmly go up to the 4th floor or above and await instructions when the waters recede was never given by this female super hero - or indeed anyone else. the whole problem was so simple to solve and yet millions of people apparently didn't think of simply going upstairs! pathetic rubbish.

as bad as they get. this film commits the fatal error of making the viewer not care what happens to characters. the two women in this flick are so stupid that you begin to root for the bad guys so this thing would end.this film is one of the few that was so bad that i had to turn to another channel. put in highbrow language, this film lacks verisimilitude. people, not even people from ohio, simply do not act like this. well, maybe the writers do.there is not enough beer in the world to make this film bearable.f903

i don't usually like tv movies, i reckon that if the thing was any good it would make it to hollywood. this one though is better than average, pretty high production values, a few interesting story twists and some nice shots of nyc (along with toronto) hold the interest.

what a sucky movie. this is without a doubt a low-class b movie. the german elite stormtroopers assault russian bunkers en masse like an old ww1 battle. the acting is mediocre, the plot thin and threadlike. it's hard sometimes to follow where it's going. the action sequences are pretty worthless (when it shows any), except for the fact that they do use authentic equipment/vehicles from ww2. this is in no way on the same level as "saving pvt. ryan" or "platoon". lots of worthless attempts at character development, which lead nowhere. old theme good officer/bad officer that's highly predictable. even the action sequences look like a 12yr old kid set them up. i could have directed better. too bad this is the same guy that did "das boot (the boat)", because that was a dang good movie. he must have partied too much after that success because he sure lost his touch when it came to this film. i bought it on dvd, better to rent it instead.

the war in the east,as the germans referred to the ww2 soviet-nazi conflict, was a war of annihilation on the part of the germany. 90% of the german army were in the soviet union fighting. their ultimate aim was to wipe out the so called "sub human (untermensch)" russian population and colonize the mainly empty country with german settlers after they had won.read "hitler's willing executioners."here we have the german army presented as innocent victims and not as nazi mass murderers. when are modern german film makers going to be honest and face up to the past?better see the russian film "come and see" instead!

i love das boot. i hoped for something along similar lines -- a realistic war movie, portraying soliders and civilians on both sides as real people, with both the joy and pain of combat.unfortunately, stalingrad appears to have been written by a third grader and directed by a fifth-grade student. major pieces of the movie simply appear missing, leaving it completely disjointed. the dialogue in translation is ridiculous, but appears no better in the native tongue; you only have to watch the actors' faces during the bad moments of dialogue to realize just how bad this movie is.

i don't know, maybe i just wasn't in the mood for this kind of movie, but it was full of trite melodrama. it was too long and seemed at least mildly disjointed (granted, i didn't pay full attention...). for a more entertaining depiction of the battle of stalingrad, see enemy at the gates. true, some pretentious folks will scoff because it's a hollywood film, and doesn't show "the gritty reality of war" like this "wonderful foreign film" does, but it has better flow and is all around just more fun to watch. besides, there are already enough contrivedly "gritty" war movies, and this one just seemed amateurly done. but hey, you might like it, so go right ahead; it just wasn't for me.

i went along to this movie with some trepidation; the original is a masterpiece of both writing and acting and unfortunately my fears were realized. this is a humorless piece of work and i sat in the theater waiting for the wit and humor to begin- i'm still waiting, it seems. updating the storyline to the present time just didn't work and the altering of characters an absolute travesty- why did they introduce bette midler's character when she disappeared just as quickly as she arrived; the related character in the 1939 original was an integral part of the plot. the women in the cinema laughed a few times but nothing touched me as being funny with the exception of a line from meg ryan talking to her mother about her situation and telling her that 'it's not like a 1930's movie'- i sorely wished i was viewing the 1930's version. it was all too touchy feely 'sisters stick together' and really needing some of the acerbic wit and clever dialog from the original play- i still watch the original movie and pick up a line that i have never caught before. there is no sense of closure to this new version, and whilst the 1939 movie is politically incorrect by todays standards, each thread was tied up and when the movie ended- it did so strongly. this remake should be labeled with a warning for any viewers- if you know the original, don't bother: i felt cheated by losing part of my life in a cinema watching this unmemorable piece of fluff. bring on the jungle red!!

director/screenwriter diane english's 2008 update of george cukor's 1939 mgm classic comedy unfortunately shows more mothballs than its predecessor. based on clare booth luce's shrewdly observant 1936 play on the relationships that evolve among a strictly female group of pampered manhattan socialites, the story would seem ripe for a contemporary remake. instead, because of english's thematic overreach, the production comes across as an extended therapy session with a paucity of wit. what's more, the diverse lifestyles of women today have been reduced to sitcom-level stereotypes in this movie, and the original play's central conceit of eliminating men from the storyline seems even more contrived given the openly pansexual evolution that has occurred among men as well as women since the 1930's. to add insult to injury, the recent big screen adaptation of hbo's "sex and the city" did this sort of sorority-style dishing much better and with far sharper fangs.the skeleton of the original play remains as the story centers on wealthy mary haines, who gave up her promising clothing design career to become the devoted wife of a wall street financial wizard. like "sex and the city", she is surrounded by three best friends - sylvie fowler, a successful, cutthroat magazine editor in the mold of miranda priestly in "the devil wears prada" (yet another film this echoes); perennially pregnant edie cohen representing the stay-at-home wife; and alex fisher, a lesbian author who seems to represent every repressed group generally excluded from such an exclusive clique. through a mouthy manicurist, they find out mary's husband is having an affair with man-eater crystal allen, a perfume girl at saks more than willing to break up a marriage as she struggles to become an actress. the rest of the plot doesn't matter much since it becomes a series of scenes focused on sisterly bonding and bickering, none of it very illuminating and without the satirical zing that buoyed the 1939 movie.looking strangely youthful at 47, meg ryan seems to play mary in a manner that tries to resuscitate the goodwill she engendered in the 1990's with "when harry met sally" and "sleepless in seattle". it's not that she isn't age-appropriate here, but her familiar sprightliness seems at odds with the character's passive nature. annette bening fares somewhat better in the scene-stealing rosalind russell role of sylvie because she has proved to be adept at conveying hardness while masking vulnerability, but her character goes through such a trite transformation that it undermines the actress' performance severely. poor eva mendes has to play crystal as a shallow, transparent shopgirl versus the smart, hard-edged cookie joan crawford got to play. debra messing and jada pinkett smith are scooted way to the sidelines as edie and alex, respectively. much better are candice bergen as mary's savvy, supportive mother and cloris leachman as the non-nonsense housekeeper.probably reflecting the lackluster box office response to the film's release, the 2008 dvd doesn't have a robust set of extras. there are two deleted scenes - one with crystal and her friends having a girls' night-in as a contrast to mary's elaborate garden party, and the other an extension of bette midler's cameo as a multi-married hollywood agent counseling mary during a late night at a yoga camp. two featurettes round out the extras" "the women: the legacy" about the history behind the film from the original 1936 play, and "the women behind the women" which has the cast and crew speak endlessly about female self-empowerment and self-image. the irony is that this version of "the women" directed and scripted by a woman takes such a patronizing look at women.

george cukor's the women remains one of the glittering gems of 1939, hollywood's most golden of golden years. the film crackled and sparked and it's absence of males was a subtle touch, hardly noticed because of all the fine entertainment.flash forward. we see fifth avenue in new york city, in front of saks. large crowds bustle along the avenue...but something's off. the shot reveals only well dressed (attractive and young) women. creepier than i am legend, the visual concept continues, inside the store and later at a large fashion show. what nyc fashion show doesn't have at least 5 gay men? the "no men" rule is rammed down our throats creating an alien world, off balance and distracting.enter meg ryan, first seen digging in her garden wearing a ridiculous get-up complete with her retro curls and flailing arms. i immediately sympathized with her husband and could understand why he looked elsewhere. later in the film she morphs into an older jennifer aniston look and keeps her arms at her sides. this seems intentional as if to say "look! i can still be relevant!" ryan's character is loaded down with a coven of miss-matched friends (insert sex and the city comparison here) who, if it were real life, would despise each other. annette bening plays the power bitch, who during the course of the film realizes her life's dream doesn't really make her happy. jada pinkett smith is the power lesbian, all atitudinous with no use for any of the men who aren't there. debra messing is some sort of baby factory that eats a lot. eva mendes is an odd choice for the bad girl to say the least. she looks fake, acts fake and any humor she tries to demonstrate falls flat. someone's comment on here that she looked trans-gender was spot on. other various stars show up, to rearrange the furniture on this titanic.the only thing that would have saved this would have been the brilliant casting of jennifer aniston and angelina jolie. they could have named their price, tucked their tongues firmly into their cheeks and pulled off something very clever and profitable. but no, hollywood thinks of itself way too highly for that kind of exploitation. instead we're given this thing that lumbers along awkwardly with no sparkle. entire sections of dialog from the original are lifted and plopped down into a scene with awful results. at one point ryan exclaims something along the lines of, "this isn't a 1930's movie!" no meg, it's not.

the women (2008) by diane english is sadly such a waste of talent. with annette benning, candice bergen, bette midler, cloris leachman whom i like and enjoy in everything i've seen them, and meg ryan, jada pinkett smith, debra messing, and eva mendes who may not be my favorite actors but are nice to look at, how could the movie be boring, predictable, embarrassing, sloppy, and simply bad? it was made by diane english who is known as the writer of the very successful tv show murphy brown, and it is her first movie for which she wrote a script. the movie has been a labor of love for english who had tried for many years to make it happen and i respect that. i even found the scenes with the supporting players, bergen, leechaman, carry fisher and bette middler in short but memorable cameos, funny, smart, and enjoyable but in general the movie is a second hand "sex and the city" which was released few months ago. i did not find sex and the city very good when i saw it but next to the women, it was simply brilliant. at least, sex and the city spared us the long and tasteless scene in the hospital's delivery room where one of the characters' was having a baby and her friends were there supporting her. poor debra messing, what did she do to deserve that nightmare she was put through and we, the viewers together with her? the movies like "the women" give the whole genre, chick flicks, a bad name. it is nothing wrong with the genre, but why is it so difficult to make a really good comedy about female friendships and hardships, about dealing with marriage, motherhood, and proving yourself professionally? these are all very compelling and important subjects any modern woman can relate to. why making movies with the lines, dialogs, and situations so clichéd, predictable, not funny and insulting that they will be forgotten as soon as the movie is over?after i saw the new movie, i checked out from my local library the original the women and i truly enjoyed it. the story was told much better 70 years ago, and kept my interest all the way. the old movie had a real star power.

i have never seen the original 1930s version of the film, but this remake is one of the worst i have seen from a major production studio in years. seeing actors such as meg ryan and annette bening, once near a level talents, sleepwalk their way through poorly scripted roles is painful. there appeared to be no desire to be in front of the camera for anyone in this film.jada pinkett smith and debra messing play worthless roles that have no bearing on the plot and add no entertainment value. jada pinkett smith's character is used as nothing more than a ploy to appear modern, having an african american lesbian character, but in actuality she is there to just look cool. there is no actual reason why messing in this film other than to fill out the amount of women in the original i take.the side characters played by eva mendes and debi mazar are stereotypical female characters, with mendes portraying the vixen looking to steal the wealthy but bored and mildly neglected husband and mazar covering the gossip roles.the movie is boring, lacking charm, humor, or sympathy for any characters. it almost felt like the movie was a punishment for everyone involved, whether in front of or behind the camera.there is one glimmering hope in the film, however little it is allowed to shine surrounded by the dim and dying stars around it is cloris leachman. leachman is still an amazing talent that brings her remarkable charm and humor to the film, in the small role that she has.

imagine a film the complete opposite of lawrence of arabia, instead of having an all male cast, it has an all female cast. instead of being set in the barren deserts of arabia, it is set in the bulging metropolis of new york city. and instead of it being one of the greatest films ever made, it is one of the most pointless, boring and forgettable.the film concerns mary haines (meg ryan) a perfect wife and mother, the envy of all others in her high society manhatten social circle. she is painted as a women bearing the weight of the world on her shoulders, despite the fact she needs a live in nanny and housekeeper to cope with her one child. but i don't want to be too hard on her, mary does all this whilst taking a liassez-faire attitude towards the fashion designing job her father has given her. this idyllic lifestyle cannot last forever though and things start to crash in a very real way.mary's husband is cheating on her and her father fires her for not working hard enough. she is quite naturally upset and breaks down a little.mary needs to bounce back though, for the sake of her impressionable young daughter and for herself. she does this through rehab, hair straightening and designing her own line of clothes; though amazingly for this kind of film, not a montage. mary succeeds; her daughter loves her, her mother loves her, her friends love her and her husband decides he loves her now. she decides to take her cheating husband back after realising it was her fault he cheated, as she didn't dote on him enough.the films one saving grace is that it doesn't go down the "all men are evil" route.

this movie is not a comedy. it is not even funny in the "this movie is so bad it's funny" department. rather, it is just plain bad. other reviewers mention the bad lighting, but beyond that is the abundance of bad plastic surgery.meanwhile, a lot of great acting talent was wasted on a poor screenplay and uninspired direction. the main characters are one-dimensional and boring. (it is hard to feel sympathy for any of them). it is also hard to see the four characters as close friends. it seems like just a bunch of women thrown together, pretending to be close.i won't list all of the problems with this movie, as it doesn't merit that much of anyone's attention. (nor is it worth the time it takes to watch it).

this film could have been a decent re-make, and gosh knows it tried (or ms. english tried). assembling talented actors together with a successful & experienced writer/director should be a formula for a decent film. but ms. english's experience - according to her imdb bio - is exclusively limited to television work, and it is glaringly obvious throughout this film.i am surprised that none of the reviews i have read mention what i found most unlikeable about this film, and what kept it from reaching even a portion of its potential: it looked and felt like it was made for television. to give some credit to ms. english, many of the jokes that simply did not work on a movie screen would have been terrific on tv (and maybe a laugh track would have helped). so much of the camera usage and the lighting would have played out fine on tv but looked awkward or odd on a big screen. if the whole film had been chopped up into a mini-series or a sit-com, i think it could have worked. but this is cinema and sadly ms. english's talents didn't translate. i cringed at so many different points in my embarrassment for the actors & the writers that i felt like i came out of the theater half shriveled! meg ryan is her usual perky, cute self (except for the awful plastic surgery she has had on her face), but where did she have a chance to use her talent?! she has made films where she doesn't recreate her stereo-typed role and done them well... but not here. annette bening seemed to simply go through the motions - such a great talent and yet such a poor performance! i enjoyed the other women characters but they were more caricature than substance, and it was sad to see. what worked in this film in the 1930s doesn't translate to the 2000s, and no one helped ms. english get the changes & updates or subtleties right. if only she (as writer, director and producer) had reached out for some assistance, i think it could have been good. but it was not.it's so frustrating to go to a movie that has good stars and a good writer or director and come away feeling it was a waste of everyone's time & money! this new yorker cartoon i saw yesterday is appropriate: a few movie execs are having a meeting & the caption reads: "let's remake a classic with worse everything!"

i was very disappointed by this movie. ms english who says that she is a fan of the original movie seemed to have taken a great piece of artistic work, and transformed it into a flat-lined "ho-hum" you've come a long way baby production. i tried to like meg ryan's mary haines, but she was just boring. she didn't seem to feel anything about her husband's affair. there was no emotional struggle, no deep hurt. in the original 1939 movie norma shearer's mary haines felt betrayed, shocked, vulnerable, confused and angry. the 2008 production was more about some fake sisterhood theme, (actually my wife's words)and didn't make you shed a tear or even chuckle. the only performances that were note worthy we're of debra messing, and bette midler. (i wanted more of bette.) there was really no protagonist in this movie. the sylvia fowler character had too many sub themes to it. and crystal allen had no fire. the remake of the department store encounter with annette benning, and miss mendez was luke warm. also the pacing was slow as well. obviously the 1939 version needed to be updated, but this one wasn't it. the reason that the original version worked so well was that the characters were dealing with "man" problems. a subject by the way which isn't out-dated. the magic of the original movie was that the movie was about both sexes, while you never saw the men.

i was kinda looking forward to man of the year, a couple girls at my work said it was a pretty good movie, and my mom said that she liked it, so i waited for the rental, and watched it last night. i have to honestly say that this movie was a huge disappointment. i barely made through it, because to be honest the beginning was pretty good and very well paced, but then it got too dark and not into the movie i saw from the trailer. it looked like a good comedy, then it turned into a very dark drama, that wasn't even that interesting, considering how many of these types of stories we've had about government conspiracy.tom dobbs is a very popular comedian with a top ranks show and has an act where many people would want him to get involved with politics, just because it seems like he has a good grip on what should be improved. so he does it, he runs for presidency, but many people doubt that he can win due to the fact that he's a comedian, but he does win! but elenore green who makes sure all the votes are accounted for tries to fix a computer glitch, but when the government tells her not to fix it, they try to get rid of her, and tom soon realizes that this may not be the job he wanted.the acting was fine, the direction was ok, it was just the story that didn't work in my opinion. like i said, it just turned into a dramatic change of genres, because if you see the trailer, you'd think it was a comedy, and when you start watching it, that's what you get, but then it just turns into a very dark and somewhat scary drama. i wouldn't really recommend this movie, it was one of the biggest disappointments i have seen so far.2/10

i found this robin williams vehicle mildly amusing at best.i guess you would call it a political satire of sorts.it's about a political talk show host/comedian who decides to run for president and unexpectedly wins.i found most of the humour dry myself,and robin williams is much more restrained and sedate than usual.i would say the movie is more of a drama than a comedy,with a bit of mystery and suspense.i think the dramatic parts worked better than the comedy parts,and the mystery and suspense aspect(though that's a small part of the movie)worked the best.still,i wouldn't rate this movie very high.for me,it was an ok waste of 2 hours,but nothing special.my best advice would be to catch it on tv/cable or rent it cheap first,before making a decision on whether to purchase.my vote for man of the year is a 4/10

i went to see this movie mostly because it looked so good in the trailers. robin williams and barry levinson should equal greatness. instead it just continues williams' bad streak of movies lately. what's wrong with the movie? more like what's right: the ensemble crew does a pretty good job around robin, and like usual, christopher walken is fantastic. that being said, this movie just plain wasn't good. i really only recommend seeing it if you want to see what it would be like if jon stewart ran for president and won. saying he won isn't a spoiler, since it was in the trailer. the concept and idea is really amusing, but that's all. most of robin's jokes are just recycled from old comedy bits of his, and there are very few laugh out loud moments, and most are just dumb. like most comedies that turn out to suck, all of the funny bits are put into the trailer. really no surprises there, but come on! some of the movie reads like a tom clancy or vince flynn novel! people were expecting this to be robin's return to greatness. instead, it's more a flubber.

this movie, while it could be considered an alright attempt at comedy, is not what the previews made it out to be. the first half is comprised of typical robin williams stand up material, though he really didn't do many voices; he was always great at the one liners and hitting the punchlines... somewhere during the election there is a problem with the computer program that is used in the election. here is where the net 3 comes in... a woman who helped with this program wants the truth to be told and the evil corporation wants to shut her up **spoilers** her boyfriend even helps them, though this isn't even fleshed out... this movie could have been one of political brilliance (perhaps with sorken at the reigns) but it falls short in a stew made by too many chefs

i liked the understated character that laura linney played in 'love actually', and she is very good in 'man of the year'.but wow. robin williams doesn't give that much of a performance, with a couple of minor exceptions this was weak. laura linney may not have been miscast, but either the editing raped her character, or this was just a sad performance by director barry levinson.and i think it was barry levinson that got old. so many weak performances, such uneven results have to be the fault of management.christopher walken and jeff goldblum are great in supporting roles. goldblum plays a sinister side with relish, and walken's combination of entertainer's manager and commentator for the film is wonderful.but the story is cliché, the presentation looks like it could have (should have) been a very good picture, and too many actions are half-hearted. the pacing, story, and direction all come up weak, compared to, say 'head office' (spoof of 'secret of my success').

i am pretty surprised to see that this movie earned even lukewarm reviews, i found this movie downright awful. the plot flounders around trying to decide if it is a comedy or a thriller, then realizes it cannot achieve either. so it throws in the towel and continues with its absurd plot highlighted with a unintentional hilarious scene with laura linney, an injection, and spilled coffee that leaves the audience awkwardly squirming in their seats looking at one another like is this for real? basically it is abysmal and really disappointing for robin williams fans, and it makes you think someone blackmailed laura linney into adding this piece of trash to her otherwise respectable resume. i wanted to leave after 10 minutes and wish i had, even seeing it for free i wanted someone to pay me for my wasted time. the computer glitch/twist in this movie was embarrassingly stupid, and by the end you don't care who wins the election. i vote for straight to dvd.

how is it possible to make such a bad movie with such actors? were they forced into it? the plot has nothing to do with an idea of how things would turn out if a comedian ran for president. they don't even try to give an impression of that. just when you thought you were watching a comment from famous liberals on dc politics (the first five minutes), the movie runs off the road and into b-film drama about 1) a computer voting error, 2) the regular evil corporate suits who wants to cover it up with the most unoriginal lines in history, and 3) a neurotic but extremely pretty female programmer who tries to tell the coming president about this. she's soon the victim of the evil x-files master-lords of the computer company, who - instead of killing her - drug her to make her seem untrustworthy. but, when she gets to dc, she doesn't tell him. in fact, the movie then changes from b-film drama, to idiotic b-film-love-drama. up to now, we are so far off the original starting point of the movie, that most people turn it off. i almost did. if it just could've been intelligent love drama, but no! it's not! it's the kind of "oops i'm so nervous i'm being stupid all the time, so please love me for it"-kind of love drama. all with a slow, slow pace, that has nothing to do with either the political plot of the movie, the x-files plot of the movie, or the comedy plot of the movie. all plots fail on all levels, which every annoying bit of meaningless dialog reminds you of. the love part has to be the result of deciding during a drinking binge "hey, there has to be a dynamic of love between the president candidate and the extremely pretty female programmer, yeah, that'll work! stick it in there!"meanwhile, lewis black is castrated and put into a role where he doesn't come up with one single lewis black line. the lewis black anger is replaced by a hope for it to surface sometime in the film, which it never does. and christopher walken is thrown into a hospital with heart trouble, to duplicate the dramatic effect of the heart attack of the president's closest aid in westwing. watching christopher walken being castrated like lewis black in roles that constantly struggles uphill to sound casual and westwing-ish, but fail like titanic every time, is like watching a great blue whale dying on a beach. heartbreaking.and then, enter the low point of the whole movie: it raises the mindbogglingly, enormously difficult ethical question: should robin williams go on to be president, knowing that he got elected because of a computer glitch? the american dream and all good prevails as he turns down the presidency on live tv, like lassie the dog would. with the usual patriotic glamor of the presidency and the we're-so-smart-that-we're-making-history-atmosphere that westwing cultivated in sickening abundance for the next million years.the director and screen writer, barry levinson, is now on my personal list of writers and directors i'm staying away from forever. this film must be seen as a symptom of a faulty production process, where people (inlcuding barry levinson) got to spend production money due to their personal relationships, and not their skills. this is a project made to satisfy poorly skilled people's wish for career success, and the formerly mentioned great actors were tricked into participating in it. that's the only explanation there can be. ps: the voting error in the computers was due to the double letters in dobbs, kellogs and mills. of course it was, what else could it be when you write a script and can't tell a computer from a dish-washing machine.

i saw a screening of this movie last night. i had high expectations going into it, but was definitely disappointed. within 5 minutes of the opening, williams is already campaigning for his presidency. and he becomes president in the first 40 minutes. so there goes all that aspect of the movie. the first half hour are hilarious. don't get me wrong, the movie has its moments. but after the first half hour, it takes a turn for the worst. it becomes less of a comedy, and more of a thriller/drama/love story...which is pointless. the movie goes nowhere and stands still for a good 30 minutes. there are laughs interspersed here and there, but the consistently funny part is in the beginning and only the beginning. at one point, the biggest cheer i heard in the audience is when a person in the crowd yelled 'boooo' during a very confusingly emotional scene. williams gives a great performance, right on par with his comedic style. walken also delivers a strong supporting role as only he can. i think the one character that goes underrated is lewis black. consistently vulgar and political, its funny to see him tone it down for a pg-13 rating. overall, i would not pay to see the movie. afterall, i saw it for free and even i was disappointed. the first half hour is solid, and its all downhill from there. not really fitting into a category, the movie realizes half way through that it should not have been anything more than a one-hour comedy central special. 4.5/10

the premise of this movie, of a comedian talk show host running for president as an independent just to shake things up, is funny, entertaining, brilliant and even a bit inspiring. (thought about the west wing debate when tom dobbs leaves his podium, thought about steven colbert announcing his candidacy, good times) the first 15 - 20 minutes of this movie are therefore very very entertaining, the debate especially. when he eventually get's elected, it's a pity that is because of a computer glitch, you'd want him to win fair (although that is unrealistic).but after that this movie goes completely downhill. i thought we'd get a great movie like 'dave' (1993) in which we see how it would out if a comedian actually ran the country. instead, the movie turns from comedy into a thriller, a romantic comedy and a drama and does none good. the computer glitch becomes the main storyline, which really sucks. boy is this disappointing. i give it 3 stars just for the premise and because i actually managed to watch this movie from start to end without stopping it, which is usually a good thing with me.

saw this movie at a saturday matinée with a friend. theater was about 70% full.although there are quite a few funny lines, it is more of a drama/suspense with humor sprinkled on top. robin williams gives a decent performance as does laura linney. being a daily show fan, lewis black is pretty good in this. christopher walken gives a good performance also. the movie starts out slow and remains that way for about the first thirty minutes, then the suspense part kicks in and starts keeping you a little on edge throughout the rest of the movie. suspense in a supposed comedy movie? i know that i, as well as everybody else in the place, was struggling a bit with this. a character would crack a joke during suspense sequence and you would hear just one or two laughs in the theater. in all fairness, after the movie was over there was smattering of applause. so, definitely, some people enjoyed this movie.i gave this movie a four out of ten, because i believe the comedy aspect doesn't work very well in a suspense/drama movie and the actors performances, while not bad, were just decent. again, this movie isn't what was advertised.

interesting and short television movie describes some of the machinations surrounding jay leno's replacing carson as host of the tonight show. film is currently very topical given the public drama surrounding conan o'brien and jay leno.the film does a good job of sparking viewers' interest in the events and showing some of the concerns of the stakeholders, particularly of the nbc executives. the portrayal of ovitz was particularly compelling and interesting, i thought.still, many of the characters were only very briefly limned or touched upon, and some of the acting seemed perfunctory. nevertheless, an interesting story.

this has to one of the most pathetic, predictable and badly acted films i have ever seen. clint eastwood has never been worse, never have i seen somebody less convincing on screen. i was laughing at him the whole way through. then there's this romance kinda thing between him and the gorgeous rene russo, which was even more pathetic than the one between mr.connery and ms.zeta-jones in entrapment.one imdb user posed the question: what's not to like about this film? i'm asking: what is to like about it? and the answer is: john malkovich. he is an absolute genius and probably the best movie villain ever (he even saved con air you know). but that's it. this movie is called in the line of fire, but 'bodyguard 2: the rip-off' seems to be a more appropriate title. watch only if you are a die hard john malkovich fan. otherwise, avoid at all cost. *1/2(out of five)

this is a standard action flick as we have seen them many times before. not much action in this one though. again it's about the guy protecting the president. he's macho - as usual, and at the same time soft and melancholic - as usual. does he have the guts to take a bullet for the president?! and then there's the girl and the usual conservative flirting around. stereotypical and predictable to the last toe-crumbling minute.

jerry lewis was marginally funny when he didn't write his own material and had a good director like frank tashlin. when he started writing and directing his own films what little talent he possessed was overshadowed by his egomania. whenever his films would fail (and deservedly so) in the american market (they made money in france) lewis always blamed everyone and everything but himself; for example, he blamed the failure of this film on the fact that it was, according to lewis, released on a double-bill with the porno feature "deep throat". if anyone should have complained about that situation, it should have been the producers of "deep throat." this is an absolutely idiotic "comedy" about the world's richest man (lewis) who is rejected for military service during ww2 and decides to outfit a special "squad" to go to germany and capture hitler himself. besides the many faults this film has (the script is mind-numbingly unfunny, lewis' "direction" is nonexistent, the film has the look of a cheap home movie), lewis apparently thought that surrounding himself with no-talent, over-the-hill borscht belt comics like jan murray and sidney miller was a good idea; he must have figured that they would be so bad, they would make him look good. he was half-right; they are embarrassingly bad, but he comes out even worse than they do. for a "comedy", lewis' character is sullen, angry and pushy; the way he heaps abuse on his underlings makes you wonder why they would ever follow a bullying jerk like this on a dangerous mission like trying to capture hitler. the fact that this movie took in any money at all is astounding. it is by far the worst jerry lewis movie i have ever seen--i've heard that "slapstick" is even more pathetic, but i can't bring myself to see if that's true or not--and is to be avoided at all possible costs.

as ben elton once observed, nothing goes quicker out of style than comedy. steve martin's latest offering - 'the pink panther 2' - recently opened to bad reviews and dismal box-office grosses, while mike myers' 'the love guru' seems to have won few admirers.in 1970, it was jerry lewis' turn to feel the pain of rejection ( ironically, his character in this film experiences a funny turn whenever anyone uses that word in his presence ) when 'which way to the front?' effectively drove him off the big screen for almost a decade.in this world war two comedy, he plays 'brendan byers 111', the richest man in the world, who wants to join the army to do his patriotic duty ( and also because he is bored with being successful ) but is rejected as he is medically unfit. he then decides to start his own privately funded army, recruiting other 4-f's.decked out with ludicrous uniforms that look like those worn by 'international rescue' in 'thunderbirds', they go into training. some good visual gags here. when they fire rocket launchers, they look pleased with themselves, until they learn they have just destroyed a texaco oil station! wishing to learn german, brendan plays a long-playing record called 'songs to mein kampf by'. when this army sits down to eat, instead of being in a draughty mess hall, they are in an opulent room decked out with a chandelier.john wood is very funny as 'finkel', byers' ever-so english butler. his best scene is when he blackmails a mafia-type gangster into teaching byers' brigade to kill.the script was not by jerry himself, but by gerald gardiner and dee caruso, author of a number of episodes of 'the monkees'. 'front' often has the look and feel of a television sitcom, indeed at times you almost expect to hear a laugh-track.where it goes badly wrong is in the last thirty minutes when byers replaces a top nazi commander and, after ordering the germans to withdraw from the front, gets involved in the plot to kill hitler ( and tom cruise is nowhere in sight! ). as the commander, jerry delivers a performance of such mind-numbing ineptitude as to defy description. he gives brian blessed a run for his money in the 'loudest man alive' stakes. it comes as a relief when the end credits appear.perhaps the timing was just wrong - bringing out a war comedy when the vietnam conflict was raging was not a good idea. or the public simply had had enough of jerry ( that beard probably did not help! ). what he needed here was a good producer, someone to take him in hand and say: "that gag stinks. throw it out!". 'don't raise the bridge, lower the river' is a masterpiece by comparison with this picture.as the '70's got underway, the new comedy icons would be woody allen, mel brooks, and monty python - fresher, more biting and in allen's case, more human styles of comedy replaced jerry's brand of slapstick. it would not be until 1982 that he would make anything like a successful comeback - as the conceited talk-show host 'jerry langford' in martin scorcese's brilliant 'the king of comedy'.

not since "8 heads in a duffel bag" and the "how high" previewshave i laughed so little at something that the film makers thoughtwould be hysterical.jerry lewis is the richest man in the world. he is rejected as 4-fby the army, and decides to use his money to raise his own army-of about half a dozen. he then impersonates a nazi commander initaly, and eventually tries to kill hitler. that is the description of theflimsy plot.this film is as funny as a heart attack. this film makes "hogan'sheroes" look like shakespeare. if the money men of "theproducers" had really wanted to lose their cash, they should haveshown this film. i cannot stress how bad this thing is.lewis' direction consists of two different cameras shooting theaction from two different angles, then being edited together. thissitcom type of direction works on television, but here it is anobvious attempt to cheat the audience. he ends most of hisscenes with a still shot, as if giving the viewer a chance to doubleover in stitches before going to the next tired set up. i spent most ofthe movie doubled over in abdominal agony, accompanied withsevere flatulence, over this thing.lewis, the director and producer, sets the film in 1943, but makesno attempt to use period costumes or sets. everyone wears thelatest style and has the latest interior design...for 1970. thesupporting cast is lost as lewis goes off on his patented tangents,which last as long as major surgery and are just as painful towatch. when lewis becomes the nazi commander, he spends thelast half of the film screaming at the top of his lungs in aperformance so odious as to stink up any good will you try to bringin at the beginning.the final embarassing shot has lewis and his cronies trying toput one over on the japanese. they wear buck teeth, squint theireyes, and talk in a "funny" accent. it may be one of the mostblatantly racist occurrences since the internment camps. i wasslack jawed at what lewis did through this whole thing, but that putme over the edge. watch for kaye ballard's very tasteless scenewhere she tries to attempt suicide over and over again."star trek"'s george takei has two small scenes, then wiselydrops out of the picture. this has less laughs than mel brooks' lastthree films combined. there is nothing sadder than watching aformerly respected comedian screw up a project so horribly, youactually feel ashamed for them. jim carrey learned that with "themajestic," but jerry lewis still shows up on television once in awhile pulling the same unfunny schtick. i feel sorry for him."which way to the front?" is cheap, unfunny, offensive, and stupid.i feel bad for everyone involved, and anyone who must endure this.i do not recommend it.though rated (g), this contains some physical violence, some gunviolence, and some adult situations. if your child shows interest inseeing this, please consult professional help.

just seen which way to the front? on tcm (uk) it is a truly awful film. if i'd paid at the pictures i'd have walked out.a terrible mess of a film. byers (lewis) and his mates prance around in cast off uniforms from an italian sci-fi movie of 1960's. were the cnd/peace symbol badges on the uniforms meant to be ironic? the sets were pure 1970, i'm sure a hollywood tv back-lot could have provided a more realistic set.the film is riddled with racism. the film takes the mickey out of veterans. not funny how lewis every got to make another film is beyond me.

i had watched this as a kid but, not being much of a jerry lewis fan, i had completely forgotten it (not that it's in any way memorable). the film revolves around impersonation (which seems to be in the curriculum of every comic star!) - in this case a german officer - and, while not as bad as leonard maltin claims (awarding it a bomb rating), it's not exactly classic stuff either - certainly leagues behind chaplin's the great dictator (1940), even if comparably narcissistic! ironically, the scenes prior to the appearance of the would-be wacky general offer more felicities than the rather forced humor at nazi expense! the film was really lewis' last gasp during his heyday; in fact, this proved to be his last vehicle to be released for 10 years (it's painfully apparent here that his particular brand of foolishness wouldn't pass muster in the age of mel brooks and woody allen)!

strangeland is a terrible horror/technological thriller. dee snider plays carleton hendricks, a disgusting computer freak who prays on young girls through the chat rooms. his ridiculous philosophies on pain and suffering are both misguided and totally unfounded. there is no tie to reality with the ideas that are presented in this film, it is more like dee snider sat down and tried to think up the weirdest stuff possible to impress horror fans and maybe some of his old fans, but the end result is just awful.unfortunately for me, as a horror fan, the cover of this movie looks very good and it immediately caught my interest, which is the main reason that i was tricked into watching it. i assure you that this is not a quality horror movie. it is a disturbing yet boring attempt to suggest what might go on in the minds of people who treat themselves the way the carleton hendricks did in this film. the sad part is that no one does this stuff to themselves. marilyn freakin' manson doesn't even go that far, and the fact that he had a song on the soundtrack makes it clear that the film wasn't meant to poke fun at his type of music (that would be a stab at snider himself), it is more like dee snider was trying to raise himself from the career-dead and present himself as a sick-minded individual once more. dee, it seems that the time has come to let it all die...

strangeland (1998) d: john pieplow. kevin gage, elizabeth pena, brett harrelson, robert englund, tucker smallwood, amy smart, dee snider (twisted sister), amal rhoe. disturbing scenes of torture `highlight' this dark, disgusting movie about a sadistic psychopath who lures teens into his torture chamber via the internet. snider (from ex-80s rock band twisted sister) plays the putrid psychopath, who is a grimy `twist' (no pun intended) on hannibal lecter. pena is wasted as one of the victims' mothers. harrelson (brother of woody) delivers one of the worst cop performances i have ever seen in a movie, and rhoe proves why this is her only screen credit with an equally pathetic performance. the heavy metal soundtrack is ultimately numbing, the torture scenes very graphic and gross, and the ending just sucks. rating: 3 out of 10. rated r for graphic violence and torture, strong language, and sexual situations.

dee snider is the villain in this movie and his bad acting and overacting kind of ruined it for me. the whole movie just seemed to take itself too seriously. it tries to achieve the dark atmosphere of "seven" without the good acting. the movie highlights the urban industrial rock / tattoo / body art "subculture" and expects us to be impressed (scared?) by the size of a guy's nose ring. i'm not a expert on movies but the script and acting in this movie are just awful. dee snider looks the part of the villain but his acing is downright horrid. i recommend not wasting the time on this one unless nothing else is available.

what starts off fairly well (and quite disturbing) quickly sinks into an annoying mess.dee snider (of twisted sister infamy) apparently penned the screenplay from his own idea, and while the idea of a cyber-stalking pierce freak has potential, they really blow it here on uneven pacing, bad dialogue, and one of the greatest non-endings you'll ever see. despite some lifeless performances, the director manages a genuinely creepy first reel. this really looks like it's going to be a good low-budget effort.no such luck. the plot goes all over the map, and snider's character relentlessly spits out tiresome psychotic fortune cookie lines that are supposed to pass for meaningful dialogue. worse, the supporting cast barely registers, and the only halfway believable dialogue comes from a young girl who helps a detective navigate the internet.what a waste of a great idea. oh, and there is a new twisted sister song, if you care.

i watched this movie on video the other night and found myself dozing off throughout this uninspired snoozefest. first of all, one of my biggest pet peeves is when movies like this are characterized as horror movies. it is a thriller! get it right!it has no monsters or anything supernatural. it is simply a movie about a twisted serial killer (actually there is a very small body count so it is more of a serial torturer movie and it did a good job of torturing me.) the basic premise of a man luring teenagers to his house of horrors through online chat rooms could have made for a great movie but we only see him lure one pair of teen girls through the internet at the very beginning of the film. one of these girls turns out to be a local detective's daughter and he gets emotionally involved in the case. the film quickly changes from a potentially intelligent sado-masochistic thriller to a boring old cat and mouse game between the incredibly dull detective and the psychopathic captain howdy/carleton hendricks played adequately by writer/producer/twisted sister frontman, dee snider. the occasional attempts at meaningful poetic one-liners about the positive effects of pain and the like from snider are laughable. if he is attempting to get people to subscribe to these opinions through this film, he fails miserably and (unintentionally) makes light of them. the directing by john pieplow (whose only previous directing effort was jurassic women, which i will let the title speak for itself) was uninspired and there was something wrong with the editing which resulted in the film being disjointed with a few scenes completely unrelated to the plot, unless the screenplay is at fault (which is quite possible.) this film a completely unsuccessful attempt at a thriller trying to pass of as a horror movie that's only achievement was making me squirm at the sight of a few graphic bodily piercings. if you see it at your video store don't waste your money but if you need something to laugh at one night and strangeland is on cable, you might as well watch. 3 out of 10

overrated mob comedy. director demme makes the actors pause after some funny lines to let audience laugh, and not miss next line. seems odd - this director did "silence of the lambs" - now there's the way to use pauses! casting seems off. mathew modine too young for fbi agent and pfeiffer's love interest! dean stockwell is doing a jack nicholson-thing with a squint, and he gets a nomination for it! plus we have to accept pfeiffer and stockwell as italians? charles napier as a hairdresser and al lewis as a mob lawyer are underused with only one line each - they should be the bumbling hoods. song score by chris isaak is totally out of place - better for a flick like "pretty in pink." re-make this movie, it's worth it, but with proper casting and director and the satire will come through... even the often repeated "forgedaboutit."

have you ever tried a kind of food that your friend made, and then said to yourself, "wow, that was not a good mix"? well, that is how i felt after watching this film.many viewers will be left highly uncomfortable with this weird mix of crime and very, very corny comedy. its almost like watching mr. rogers play a ruthless gangster, very weird. some things just don't mix and this film clearly proves that.there are some very good performances here, as dean stockwell, mercedes ruhle, and alec baldwin are all excellent, but that doesn't make up for the lack of balance and symmetry in the film.jonathan demme has done some excellent work in films such as silence of the lambs and philadelphia, but seems to be out of his element with this one.

this is a film that has garnered any interest or praise it has received simply on the merit of being a lesbian interest piece. the performances are mostly emotionless compared to better films in the glbt interest genre. the entirety of the film's watchable value is garnered through modest suspense over whether and when the partners' family members will say something discouraging about their lesbian relationship. the best element of the film is likely the beautiful new england scenery, although much of the film is set inside. it is hard to envision how any viewer watching this film and not seeking affirmation of their glbt lifestyle or wishing to see that of others affirmed, even through poorly realized drama, could appreciate treading water in any significant way. it is a terrible movie.

a bad movie about a bad movie. is that original, or what? if it is, then that's the only good thing about it. the lovely ally sheedy couldn't stop this bomb from destroying movie theaters and vcr's everywhere. it should also be noted, that she, and the other actors hired by danny aiello's character were billed as themselves, as well as the characters they played in his d-rated film. calling it a b-rated film, is too much of a compliment, and would lead to delusions of grandeur.

it's hard to decide what to say about this one. it isn't totally, one hundred percent bad. although the movie-in-a-movie is unspeakably bad, meant to be campy, but missing by a mile. i'm pretty sure that this is intentional, however. danny aiello is perfectly adequate here, and more or less nails his pathetic character. dyan cannon was good in a small role. clotilde courau was impressive as the latest twenty-something girlfriend. and linda carlson had a brave topless scene that she pulled off very well.so, it's not totally bad, but i don't believe that this one accomplishes its goals. all in all, it's probably worth passing on.

my wife and i saw every episode in this series and loved it. however, the series was cut short without a final episode by the producers of the show. it ended with a typical end-the-season cliff hanger leaving it's fans feeling cheated. a waste of great writing and acting.

when i first saw "race against fear" (don't you just love lmn movie titles?), i had to keep scratching my head. was this meant to be serious? why couldn't the main character even run like a normal person running, much less like a star runner? how did i know that the coach was evil only 1 minute into the film? all of these questions, and no answers. then, i just let the inane script and the awful directing just carry me away...it was easier not to resist...then the film became funnier by the minute, and i now rank it among my top ten junk movies from lmn. some have said here that ariana richards is really talented but that the material was flawed - i heartily disagree. not only can she not convince me that she's an athlete, she's walks wide-eyed through the rest of the story, like she's just landed on earth. maybe the coach broke out of prison and finished her off...at least i hope so.

this movie was pretentious, foppish and just down right not funny. the filming technique reminded me of mtv. i am a fan of hartley. but what was he thinking of? so much more thought could have gone into this movie, considering the subject matter. this could have been a true theoretical battle over good and evil, but hartley, it appears used the stand technique of psyching out the viewer.

it opens - and for half an hour, runs - like an educational programme on the old testament, although not without humour. the movie finally begins to grow wings when the biblical cant gets dropped. in a scene of mixed success martin donovan (jesus) decides to renege on kicking off the apocalypse and the final quarter of an hour is a sort of humanist 'what's all the fuss about?' play-out, gilded with optimistic conjecture against a (retrospectively, miserably ironic) long shot of the wtc twin towers.apart from donovan's authority, the acting is split. there's the thespian melodrama of the rest of the cast: this, though formally contrived for biblical presentation, is appropriate for the modern, paranoid comedy that hartley's aiming at. but i was also pleasantly surprised at the contribution of pj harvey (credited thus, and in danger of existing within the film solely as the pop star entity she is, not least in a set piece scene in a record store and a perilously patchy soundtrack to which contributes). she remained cool - a sort of disingenuous lack of focus - in the manner of many pop icons who have taken to film (i'm thinking the jagger of performance here) but nonetheless maintained a convincing integration with both cast and project.ultimately affirmative, but this bittersweet essay is a bit too much like one and relies more on the perseverance than the imagination of its audience. 4/10

this movie was shot using a digital camera, and it shows. there were enough annoying digital tricks used to alienate the viewer, also with the help of a terrible score. as if that weren't enough, the acting was also terrible. now in hartley's movies the acting is always peculiar, but here it was just bad, especially by satan (thomas jay ryan)and harvey, who (thank god) doesn't get to say much. after all these external problems it is also very unfortunate that the story itself is not that good, either. the jokes are predictable and unbelievably straightforward, and the events just rumble on from one incident to the next. the so-called book of life with armageddon inside isn't much more than an excuse to see actors struggle to say their lines. all in all this movie is a waste of time and money and effort. thumbs down.

i found this on the shelf and swooned with joy !! i danced up to the counter, slapped down my money and ran home! you know what?! i fell asleep less then half way thru! tried again the next day...yawn!! what the heck !?!! i could not watch it! i love all the other stuff he's done (i didn't see the one with the monster in it yet). what gives? is it me? or him? so sad. boo hoo. p.s, i did like the camera work.

hey, remember when hal hartley was brilliant? what a time that was. i'd say the book of life was when things really started going downhill, but i will say that at least he went uphill from this one. a movie that looks like it was filmed on someone's cell phone wouldn't have to be a bad thing if it was distinguished by an interesting story and dialog, but alas, those are missing, along with hartley's spare, quirky dialog. in their place is tedious exposition on themes of christian end of times and a trite story of a modern jesus in a quandary, packaged in a trying-to-be-hip modern world where everyone looks like someone out of a hal hartley movie. while it picks up a little in its second half, it's never enjoyable, or especially sensible. what the hell happened to you, hartley?

should you wish to see the worst film ever made, look no further. some wretched movies are watchable because they are unintentionally funny. alas, american movie has no wit at all, no unintentional humor, just obscenities thought by its director to be laughable.for those who liked this film, i suggest you watch kevin smith's "clerks," similar in tone. in clerks you will find creativity, wit, and enjoyment -- all on a shoestring budget. it should make you forget this hideous effort.

this movie sucked wind. i imagine that the other 300 people that gave this movie such high votes must be independent filmmakers. i can't imagine that anyone else could possibly find it funny or even slightly entertaining. i feel like 100 minutes of my life were just wasted.

this is an emperor's new clothes situation. someone needs to say "that's not a funny and original, (etc., etc.) film; that is an inferior film. don't waste your money on it." the film is trashy, and the people in it are embarrassingly inferior trailer trash. they are all-too-realistically only themselves. they have no lines, they don't act. the american dream is not to create shoddy no-quality films or anything else shoddy and of no-quality; it is to achieve something of quality and, thereby, success. only people who are desperate to praise any film not made in hollywood (it can't have been made in hollywood, can it?) would try to impute any kind of quality to this film. it's worse than "ed woods," another film about a film-maker without standards. these films shouldn't have been made, and you shouldn't go see "american movie."

this film has been lauded to the point of the ridiculous. "american movie" is a boring documentary about a boring person so ordinary you'll find equivalents on just about every corner in america. it takes a long, hard look at a guy who's failed at just about everything in the interest of making an independent movie..or two. were his failures for other than his own selfish pursuits or were they in the name of real art, the movie might have had a chance. america has an abundance of better stories to be told. this one should be flushed and many critics have good reason to be ashamed. two thumbs up indeed!

i usually enjoy underground movies and antiheroes but this is a bad joke. i wonder how this can be called a movie. all these people are loosers and the filmmaker doesn't succeed in making them interesting at all. they are not funny, not tragic just plain stupid and boring.may be i missed something but i won't watch it again to find out what. anybody with a camcorder can do better than that...i give it a 1 for the originality. all the rest is crap.

i love documentaries. they are among my favorite genres of film. before seeing this film i hadn't seen one that i hadn't liked.the premise for this film is a great one. the execution is well done. there were some times early on when i laughed and smiled. yet as the film went on the more tedious and irritating it became. this could have been something special had the subject not been such an inarticulate, childish, inept putz. i appreciate his passion for film, but quit your whining. if you're short on funds, maybe you shouldn't have so many kids, or spend so much money on alcohol. maybe you should have gone to film school, or at least graduated from high school. maybe you should have lived life and gotten perspective and experiences that could add to your vision. there are so many people out there with stories that are interesting, funny and poignant. to see this guy chosen over any of them is nothing less than crass. if you want to do a documentary on a film maker, why not do one on someone from china or iran, a film maker with real problems? two final questions:who takes a little kid to see apocalypse now?how many times did this guy say "man"?

sorry, folks, but all of you that say this is a great documentary... and that award it won at sundance... well, you've all been duped. i've heard for a few years how i had to see this documentary and i finally watched it. maybe in 1999, when it came out, and reality tv didn't have such a dominant presence in the industry, this movie would have seemed entertaining. but mike and mark are so obviously playing themselves, mike and mark. at times they are funny and some of the lines seem off the cuff, but mostly they do not ring true. they are the reality version of jay and silent bob. yes the people are real, they are not actors, but it's put on, it's exaggeration of themselves, and it's so obvious that it's hard to believe so many people think it's the real deal. i wasn't fooled so it was actually a tad boring. mildly amusing, but not missing much if you miss it.

this was a dreadful, boring movie, even for a documentary. at times, it did provided insight to life and also had humorous moments, but overall it was not worth seeing. every time i began to feel sympathetic towards mark and began to hope he would be successful, i would become disappointed by his lack of responsibility and drug and alcohol abuse.

this was the most uninteresting horror flick i have seen to date. the premise is glaringly forgotten after about 1 minute. the acting is terrible. the scariest thing about this movie is when the two guys kiss, yuck! what were the film festival judges thinking when they gave this garbage a 'best film' notation? the only reasons i didn't turn this movie off were to see what not to do as a filmmaker, and if the paper-thin plot line could really keep going on as is was. i was not disappointed by this latter notion. there wasn't even a single bit of nudity or gore to keep the kiddies interested! also, i thought it was tacky to use about 3 minutes of "resident evil 2" in the movie... was that supposed to be filler? 'cause it was the goriest and most interesting part of the movie.

pretty disappointing. i was expecting more of a horror/thriller -- but this seemed to be more of an episode of dawson's creek but with out the acting. there were some very impressive shots, though -- almost worth seeing. maybe future efforts will improve.

it is the early morning of our discontent, and some friends of mine and i have just gotten through watching "the wind." truly a disaster film. not in the sense of forces of nature wreaking havoc on an unsuspecting populace, but rather an awful movie wreaking havoc on an unsuspecting audience. to give you an indication of how frustrating it was to watch this particular bomb, i'll give you an example quoted during my first pained viewing. if given the choice of watching this movie for a second time and, say, boiling myself, i'm afraid to say the choice would not be an immediate one. but rather than simply ranting "ad peliculam" with lousy one-liners, i'm going to get specific as to why exactly my friends and i panned this particular film.to start this off, i like low-budget horror flicks. i even like artsy, low-budget horror flicks. i liked "cold hearts", "midnight mass," "jugular wine," etc. films that were ambitious and daring, even if they were lacking in production value, execution and even acting. generally, an interesting premise, unusual camera technique or merely just a well done scene or two will save a movie that is running a little rough around the edges. with these provisos in mind, i would like to say conclusively that i hated "the wind."the movie was probably most disappointing in the sense that it was incredibly frustrating to watch. from the actions of the main characters, to the flow (?) of the plot, to the big portents hinted at by the opening which ultimately aspired to dust (and did not even attach themselves logically to what transpired in the remainder of the film, and left the viewer, expecting something more, with a sense of much ado about nothing). the dialogue was spotty at best, woodenly delivered and completely unrealistic. by this i mean, no one in any of the situations that the characters were in would have reacted the way the characters did, or said the things that they said in the way that they said them. there was an obvious lack of vision and direction that would have corrected this problem. character interaction and development was abysmal. claire, the "lambent sex goddess," or so the aggravating, passive-aggressive lamesters in the movie thought, was so overt in her manipulations she may as well have pulled a gun on the characters. nevertheless, she was the shining high point of the film. the other main characters (with the exception of mick's milfy mom, who was not terrible) are so indistinct that they may as well have been portrayed by the same actor. let's see if i missed anything: borderline personality, co-submissive goons with profound feelings of sexual confusion and inadequacy, spurred to fits of puerile rage through the artless orchestrations of a loose-lipped bimbette-suddenly-and-unmasterfully-turned-caligari. no, i think that about covers it.lack of scope was also problematic. how did those involved with the making of this film expect the casual viewer to derive that this was the beginning of the end of the world from this amateurish, unbelievable, poorly-portrayed lust pentagon (well, what would you call it?) that occurred largely in the woods in the middle of nowhere? there were no witnesses to the "atrocities" presented. there were no witnesses anywhere in this film.the believability problems stemming from this lack of attention to detail were rife even from the point where the plot begins to sicken. case-in-point: if that guy bob took that route through the woods to come home from the gym, and here's the key, ****every day****, there's a jolly good chance that someone else would have been around to see something at some point afterwards while the perpetrators argued vociferously about the crime scene. one would think that with the murder of a young man in the woods, said town would have been in an uproar, the characters would have been questioned, etc. but instead, there wasn't a witness in sight (other than earl, the closet psychopath with no inner monologue). we suggest that there be no witnesses *for* this film, either. as for the quasi-homosexual meanderings present, i don't have a problem with those either. it's not as if they came as a surprise, considering we had been shouting as to the closet case stati of most of the male characters since the second scene. again, not problematic in and of itself, but thrown in for the wrong reasons. it was utterly unnecessary, thrown in for pure "shock" and/or "dangerous art" value, and neither shocking nor dangerously artistic from any perspective. what we had instead was an awkward attempt to redeem a boring, clumsy movie with a boring, clumsy plot. the poorly hinted-at sexual tension, which was only hinted at heavy-handedly in anticipation of this flaccid snogging scene, only pushed this film further down the totem pole from "mediocrity warranting criticism" to "film sucking so bad that it lacks the inherent grace to suck enough to properly mock and harangue."so it is with most of the film, a lot of artistic fumbling, very little meat and a lot of aggravation. it's not that we don't get it. oh, we got it, alright. we just don't want it. look, the very fact that we were cheering the bludgeoning in the final scene as the *only* tableau that made sense on its face is an indication that something was terribly wrong with this film. rather than moving briskly along as its name implies, this movie oozed languidly forward like the sweat trail working it's way down the side of your nose while your hands are full. argh. that sensation pretty well sums up the gut-wrenching frustration realized while watching this train wreck. there is no breath of fresh air with regard to this movie, only the stale miasma of bad ideas poorly realized, putrefying before coming to fruition.

the movie is okay. meaning that i don't regret watching it! i found the acting purely and the most of the dialog stupid ("oh no, this was my grandmothers bible!"). it's sort of bad remake of u-turn. a man arrives to a desert town out in nowhere, meets the wrong people and falls in love with the wrong woman. and off cause get's involved in something, he thought he could leave behind him. the movie is quite predictable and there is really nothing new in it. when it's finish, you didn't really care. most of the characters are stereotypes, specially brian austin green!! all in all just another movie from the states, but okay entertaining on boring wednesday night. imdb vote: 4/10

it starts off pretty well, with the accident and the decision not to return to la. but everything falls into place too quickly. there is a decent plot twist towards the end, but so many scenes that don't make sense. randy (played by brian austin green) comes home angry and ready to confront people and he takes the time to put on the club, when he parks his car in front of his house in the middle of nowhere? i don't want to spoil it, for anyone who does decide to see it, but the last 45 minutes are ridiculous. even the acting, which wasn't bad early on, turns bad towards the end. don't bother unless you want to see how bad it is.

los angeles physician tom reed (vincent ventresca) survives a tragic auto accident but ends up going to prison in the high desert of california. when his time is up he lands in a small, wind-swept town named purgatory flats. his first stop is a bar, where he quickly slams a beer and gets hired as a bartender. so much for ex-cons having a tough time finding work. this is the first in a long line of absurdities that make up the plot of writer/director harris done's silly attempt at modern, desert-set, film noir.his first night on the job tom meets a sexy femme fatal named sunny (alexandra holden), who hangs out with a family of bad boys: the mecklins, consisting of uncle dean (gregg henry) and his two nephews, the drug addicted owen (kevin alejandro), who is sunny's husband, and awol soldier randy ("90210"s brian austin greer). after his shift is finished there's a shooting, and dr. tom just happens to be nearby. he agrees to treat one of the wounded and, most importantly, not tell the cops. i'm not sure that's a good move for a guy fresh out of the pen, but this script (co-written by diane fine) has very little to do with logic.tom makes a series of poor decisions that get him further and further entangled with the criminally inclined mecklin boys, including stealing medical supplies and hopping into the sack with sunny. everybody in the theater is screaming, "don't do it! walk away", but tom does it anyway.in a classic film noir like "body heat" or "double indemnity" we root for and empathize with william hurt and fred mcmurray as they get sucked into the web of bright, sexy, devious femme fatals like kathleen turner and barbara stanwyck. it's not their fault. we'd probably be tempted by all that money or that particular dame, too. but dr. tom's weakness seems to stem from stupidity more than circumstances. sunny is sexy but not a very compelling character, and there's no money to tempt him. you're left wondering if he attended the same medical school as dr. nick riveria from "the simpsons".the silly script would have you believe that a redneck's rural home has almost everything you need to treat a gunshot to the stomach, and that one so wounded could easily hop to attention and effectively participate in a fist fight. it gives us an implausible car chase with one of those "the club" things clamped to the steering wheel. oh, that oil tanker that just exploded - no one noticed that.i wonder how such a ridiculous script ever got green-lighted? perhaps brian austin greer has more juice than i gave him credit for. it's obvious that he took the relatively small role of randy - a hot-headed murder - to show producers that he had more acting range than he displayed on "90210".it's also sort of sad to see nicholas turturro playing a stereotypical hispanic drug dealer. he deserves better than this.if you have an iq over 50, "purgatory flats" will have you shaking your head in disbelief. i'll give it 3 stars for the unintentional laughs and the scenes with the sexy miss holden running around in her red panties.

i read all of the other comments which made this movie out to be an excellent movie. i saw nothing of the excellence that was stated. i thought it was long and boring. i tried twice to watch it. the first time i fell asleep and the second time i made it to within six minutes of the end and gave up. i suppose that it was mainly my fault going in with great expectation, but i don't think that this would have completely ruined the movie for me. the movie was just bland. it had nothing that was spectacular or unique to it. the plot was not half bad, the action sequences were non-existent, the dialogue forced and the movie just went on forever. i would not recommend seeing this movie.

lots of flames, thousands of extras in battle scenes, lots of beautiful sets. i don't think the plot supported such a vast expenditure. the story could have been told far more effectively and have been more valid, psychologically if there weren't so much macho bombast in the production. chinese movies tend to be this way, in my experience. and i think this detracts from the film.

now i have seen two movies by the director chen kaige, a very good one (farewell my concubine), and this bad one, the assassin. both movies depict crucial events in chinese history, fmc in the 20th century and ta the first unification of the whole chinese nation in the 3rd century bc. fmc succeds with memorable characters, gorgeous cinematography, convincing sets, good acting and an interesting story. the assassin fails on nearly every level (okay, the sets are great, the cinematography is good, and the few battle scenes are quite exciting). but...the pathos. call me a cynic, but too much is too much. if you felt that saving private ryan was too pathetic, be aware, this here will make you sick. the dialogue is lifeless, many lines seem like political statements, subtle or entertaining is this pic not. the film is overpowered by its own pompousness. i am really surprised that the assassin gets such high votes here on imdb. 4/10

the net is a movie i never saw upon release, i remember giving it a pass upon the mediocre reviews and since then perhaps been noticing a snippet here and there when it's been on tv. seeing it now, fourteen years after it's original release, i'm a little flabbergasted as to how time flies. being in my mid 20's, it made my childhood feel ancient. i felt as if i should probably do some exercise before my body starts stacking up fat in all the wrong places. cut down on fat and sugar. too much coffee and cigarettes.anyway, that was the best part of this movie experience for me. i'd say the first 30 minutes of this movie really kept me occupied with retro heaven. look at those big cans they call computers. look, they chat in chat rooms! i remember those tank tops! they look.... stupid. and hey, it even stars sandra bullock. first billed! would you look at that.as a movie, the net is just an unimaginative, plain and totally routine hitchockian cat-and-mouse thriller. nothing archaic about that, they made them then as much as they make them now. bullock plays a reclusive computer nerd who's job it is to fix software for people who don't get "that whole computer thingy". as it happens, she stumbles upon some delicate information and after her vacation trip ends up with her nearly getting killed by a sexy lay who turns out to be a killer (played by jeremy northam, and she should have been suspicious by the fact that they are in an american movie and the guy both smokes and has a british accent!) she gets her "identity wiped out". her house is empty, for sale, and upon checking it out, it turns out that she now has got a new identity. a convicted prostitute and impostor, no less.now you might say that this is improbable. how could they possibly do that to her? even in 1995, it's impossible! that's true, but back in '95 a lot of people didn't even know what the internet was. i can see how it's a plot hole you could have accepted back then. what's far more disastrous though is the inconsistencies that have nothing to do with technology. the movie obviously owes a lot to hitchcock movies (it's one of those thrillers that feature a merry-go-round by night) but hitchcock always made sure that his movies were plausible. the characters didn't act like confused maniacs when trying to prove their innocence, and the plot didn't conveniently lay down for a structure where one obstacle inevitable leads to the other. the characters also tried a little before giving into the whole rouge chase. has bullock's character really no friends what so ever? couldn't any old high school teacher confirm her identity? or like... her nearest pizza guy? oh right, she orders pizza from the internet. never mind. you figure the movie out pretty quickly. there seems to be hope in an ex boyfriend. you really think so? you should always count on at least one surprise. the net offers none.the internet poses a lot of danger, this movie seems to predict. but, had the movie been made today, imagine the troubles the villains would have to go through to ensure the identity wipe. not only do they have to do all those boring literal things, she would still have her facebook membership, with at least like 100 friends or so, and picture tags, not to mention she might be on youtube or linked-in, and what about her video blog with like 150 daily hits, or the webcams in her house and recorded video of her in other people's cell phones, webcams, web downloads... her imdb membership?

"the best movie of the 90's" "the welsh trainspotting"....aye, right! i went into this movie with pretty high expectations, and it was all downhill from there.this movie was supposed to be this archetypal movie on the drug culture of the early 90's, and was going to allow us all to see inside this scene, and shatter the media's preconceptions following the moral panic which followed the death of leah betts in 1995. unfortunately it has fallen a long way short. where trainspotting was able to treat you like an adult on the subject, and potential problems that surround drugs, this just provided us with some schmaltzy tale of the wonder of drugs, and how it can like, you know, like totally open your mind. cue some guff about bill hicks, and howard marks ad nausea. it is painfully bad at times. i mean, the scene at the end between lulu and her auntie actually made me laugh out loud.now maybe i am just a cynic, but the way jip leads us through this tale is like listening to that acid frazzled guy you once met at a house party, who talks to you about how "the man" is holding us back, and how acid has released him from the strains of modern society. you just wanna shake some sense into him, and ask him to leave the premises.the script was a real problem for me, because where trainspotting had irvine welsh's excellent book to cite from, this is written and directed by justin kerrigan. the words "jack of all trades, master of none" come to mind. you can see where his inspiration comes from, particularly in the style of narration from main character jip (which sets the main character in a social situation where he speaks directly to the camera, and outlines what is going through his mind as the scenario plays out) the problem with this is that some of the speeches to camera are just painful to watch. mainly this comes down to a lack of empathy for jip, but they are so desperate to sound philosophical that they just end up sounding like your average a-level drama project. the direction is fine, and the intentions are good, but it is so lacking in any integrity that you start to wonder what the hype is about.saying that though, it is not all bad. there are moments which are genuinely very amusing, and entertaining. moff is the highlight of the movie for me. for an independent movie it also managed to attract a high numbers of quality british actors/actresses, which maybe outlines why there was such a buzz about the movie.best movie of the 90's? not by a long shot, but if you're looking for a solid sunday night movie, then this might just be your bag. inevitably though, the movie is flawed by the hype that surrounds it.

utterly useless... having been there, done that with the subject matter i have to say this captures the clubbing atmosphere in absolutely no respect. it may have done so had the characters not just been mouthpieces for incredibly dire, unrealistic drivel. so many cringe-worthy scenes that would put the office to shame (not a compliment to this film). it also may have helped to have some semblance of a story, a point, a message, a commentary, anything. seriously, kevin & perry go large had more to say on the subject than this film (term used very loosely in this case). there should be minus numbers reserved for films like this. -10 (extra turd)

i cannot believe how this atrocity managed to capture the hearts and minds of a cross-section of the 'bright young things' of its era, but i'm certain i wish it hadn't. in my opinion it is an inaccurate, poorly acted, weakly scripted, pretentiously directed piece of gumpf. the brief outings to an imagined reality bludgeon any humour to death. the situations are unsubtle exaggerations which make the the already flimsy characters even more unbelievable and detestable. the romance is dull, the end is unsatisfying and ruins the only sensible drugs message in the film and the simple plot ('withnail and i,' 'fear and loathing') is tested to extremes with the uninteresting motion of the film. in short this film as a blatant visual assault with no hint of skill or initiative. i condemn it to the ash heap of history and pray it stays there.

it was tough watching harrison ford obsessing over nothing. kristin scott-thomas should have slapped this guy and told him to take a hike.save your money. don't even bother with a rental fee, unless you need a good nap.

as was mentioned before in other comments, the major problem of nva is that it cannot decide what it wants to be, slapstick of the cheapest kind or an honest parody of the east german army. there are a couple of moments which are quite moving, for example when one of the recruits returns from the army prison in schwedt with a completely broken personality. but in the end, leander haußmann goes for the infantile humour. no wonder the film flopped at the german box office as it's historically untruthful to the real situation in those training camps and led by an actor who is unfortunately incapable of giving a nuanced performance.however, there is the camera work of frank griebe who - as always - does a wonderful job. if it wasn't for his beautiful images i would have rated the film far worse.

i didn't expect too much from this movie, but i was still disappointed. it's supposed to be a comedy, but there are only four or five scenes where i actually laughed, and i think that's rather poor. there is no real plot either, i always had the feeling that most of the scenes could have been put anywhere in the movie because there's no connection between them. but the worst thing was the "acting" of kim franke. he has one facial expression during the whole movie, as if he was supposed to play some retarded guy, but i believe that's not the case. all in all i rate it four out of ten, i've seen worse movies than this, but i wouldn't spend money on this one again.

what a shame. this could have been good. the main problems are the script and the star. the film cannot decide whether to be a slapstick comedy (of a very uninspired and routine kind) or whether to be a insightful satire on the old east germany and its mores. its attempts at the latter flop totally, however. the film does not hold together well and the ending is very artificial and unbelievable. any stereotypes one might have about german comedy are sadly reinforced.the characters are stereotypes one and all, and the leading character, played by kim frank, is colourless in the extreme. he just cannot carry the film and appears to have been chosen largely for his baby face. it may not be all the actor's fault (he is a pop singer), as the script does not give him much to work on.one plus -- the recreation of the east german 'style' and period is good.the worst thing is that the film feels somehow dishonest and demeaning. the film seems to have been churned out by people who were not necessarily giving it their best and just wanted to make a quick buck from a few cheap laughs. (if they were giving it their best, it is a sad case indeed!) i watched it at the cinema with an east german audience and i felt sorry for them. the gdr regime was awful in almost all respects, but those who lived through it deserve better than this.

if rich people are different from us because they have more money, then film makers are different from us because they think the world cares about their every thought.this self-indulgent piece of tripe seems to have been made just because the director felt it was time to make another movie, and someone would finance it. not every trivial idea or reflection is worthy of a movie (unless you are a college film student trying to complete a course). when you don't have anything to say, sometimes it is best to remain quiet.the visuals are not breath-taking. they are quite ordinary. the dialog is inane and unbelievable. they speak words no one would every sequence together in situations that are beyond imagination. germaine greer's zipless f**k is finally brought to the screen. even if you believe in love at first sight, no one falls into bed as easily as these characters. they screw before they talk. even more unbelievable is an aging, balding director finding instant sex with the most beautiful chick in town, though gravity is already getting to miss marceau at a youthful age.

i haven't seen any other films by antonioni and the people that saw this one with me agreed that it shares themes and imagery with the rest of his works. maybe if i had seen other stuff by him i would have enjoyed this one, knowing what to expect. i saw it as an almost complete failure for so many reasons. first of all, the film introduces interesting, deep issues about social relationships, feelings, the nature of reality versus fiction, but this is very often done in the clumsiest of ways making the characters speak as if they were delivering speeches, rambling on and on, juxtaposing declarations rather than having dialogues. the scriptwriters seem to be so worried that we will not get the point that they prefer to tell instead of showing.secondly, the movie has no rhythm, especially in its first half. it is not only that it is slow. some slow films have been made with an excellent sense of pace and rhythm (el sur by victor erice or scorsese's the age of innocence are examples i like), but for that to be successful it is necessary that we find the characters so engaging or the story so moving that we can adapt to it. this does not happen in beyond the clouds, where the first episode seems to drag endlessly, and the relationship between john malkovich's "reality" and the love stories "fiction" is at times fluid, others abrupt, others confusing.

reports of this film's brilliance appear to have been greatly exaggerated, and unless the other reviewers were watching a different movie, i fail to see how anyone can find this film anything other than dull, unscary, uncreepy, overlong, and at times, unbearably irritating. i'm not some schlocky horror fanatic. i love j-horrors and euro-horrors over american horrors any day, but i feel the need to warn any potential viewers about this film before they invest two hours of their life in it.it could have been so great. a reporter is investigating a series of bizarre deaths and occurrences, which seem ostensibly unlinked, but a series of unnerving tropes appears to connect them - dead pigeons, thudding noises, the presence of strangely tied knots... our reporter goes from person to person, interviewing them, filming them and then passing on. three important characters are among this jumble of people, a young, shy psychic girl, an immensely irritating, insane psychic man, and a crazy old woman and her boy, whose importance is not revealed until later on.the problem is that the film is not even remotely interesting, which makes its two hour running time unforgivable. it's also not even remotely scary or creepy. supposedly scary scenes, like shots of ghoulish faces are done incredibly poorly, shown twice, or worse, we are told when they are about to happen. other techniques, such as telling us that a family just interviewed "died five days later" simply don't make me care, let alone mildly creeped.the film does pick up a bit towards the end, as our reporter, cameraman, psychic and cursed woman go to a village in order to 'remove' the curse which is linking all these deaths. however, by that time, i was in a state of catatonic boredom, and couldn't care less, so all the fairly creepy camera-work and shocks were wasted on me. the "final tape" is quite good, but once again, i'd given up caring and just wanted this film to end.boring and dull, not scary and not creepy, i would advise you keep away from noroi. it has promising moments, but this is a film that was poorly made and not worth your time.

big d.b. tries to keep peace between the settlers and their red brothers.boone (an aging bruce bennett) has to try and prove to the local indian chief (lon chaney, jr., appearing to be drunk, as usual) that his son was killed by the tribe's leading jerk who has also been dealing in rifle-trafficking when nobody's looking. faron young sings, though he holds his rifle like it's a mop. ok western-adventure directed by two guys, neither of whom has many credits on his resume, but this flick ain't too bad and it has a nice short running time of 76 minutes.

after hoo-hooing american indians scalp number one son, frontiersman bruce bennett (as daniel boone) seems, at first, like he wants to get even; but, he really wants to make friends with the natives. when sad-eyed indian chief lon chaney jr. (as blackfish) also loses number one son, it gets more difficult to clear up misunderstandings. apparently, this was republic pictures' attempt to do for their "daniel boone, trail blazer" what disney studio's had successfully done with "davy crockett, king of the wild frontier" (1955).the "dan'l boone" song, whistled and sung by a group of children in a wagon, did not follow fess parker's "davy crockett" up the hit parade. singer faron young (as faron callaway) doesn't perform the title song (perhaps wisely); he does sing "long green valley", and makes a good impression as a blond boyfriend for boone's daughter. but, spanish actor freddy fernandez is the film's most valuable player. in a cute scene, mr. fernandez reminds mr. young the name of the character ("susannah") he is supposed to be in love with.**** daniel boone, trail blazer (10/5/56) ismael rodríguez ~ bruce bennett, lon chaney jr., faron young, freddy fernandez

and i may be being generous. the overwhelming majority of the movie consists of looped footage...the shambling monster, two women exercising, the shambling monster again, a bunch of people in the pool, the shambling monster again, none the worse for wear despite having been injured...you get the picture. i restrained myself from yelling "get on with it already" on several occasions.and it doesn't help that the footage they used was poorly produced. the sound is disconcertingly out of sync with the image. and in the one scene where they tried to get "artistic" with the lighting and camera techniques, the lighting guy, holding the flashlight that provides the scene's only illumination, is clearly visible in the shot.my hope is that the production was the victim of some horrible disaster in which the original audio track and most of the footage was destroyed, but they decided to release it anyways, cobbled together from the editing room floor, in memory of the heroic crew members who gave their lives trying to save the *real* film - the one with the plot and the interesting dialog. sadly, there's no evidence of this, and i'm forced to conclude that, in the immortal words of joel and the bots, they just didn't care.

following the world war ii japanese attack on u.s. forces at pearl harbor, "the eastside kids": leo gorcey (as muggs), bobby jordan (as danny connors), huntz hall (as glimpy), david gorcey (as peewee), ernest morrison (as scruno), and bobby stone (as skinny) want to serve their country. but, both the u.s. army and navy reject them as too young. still wanting to "knock off about a million japs", the "boys" attack an asian clerk, who turns out to be chinese. the unfortunate incident does, however, lead the gang to help uncover some really nasty japanese and german people.if "too young" is defined as "under twenty-one", only mr. jordan and mr. stone would be rejected for military service. but, it's possible recruiters were turned off by the office manners displayed by mr. gorcey and mr. hall. "let's get tough!" was made during what the script accurately describes as "open season on japs" - for this and other reasons, it hasn't aged well. it's a wasted effort, but the regulars performs ably, with tom brown moving the storyline along, as jordan's spy brother.*** let's get tough! (5/29/42) wallace fox ~ leo gorcey, bobby jordan, tom brown

propaganda pro-american war effort film that came out in 1942 has the east side kids getting tough against any japanese they spot in their own neighborhood when they learn they're too young to enlist. ultimately they learn they were mistaken in their mistrust of some individuals but also happen to stumble across a spy ring they then set out to bust. the film is harmless enough in its fashion although some may well take offense given how innocent asians really did get singled out during the second world war. overall though, it's a pretty generic effort and both leo gorcey and huntz hall would have better moments, the best of which tend to come here when they ad-lib.

let's get tough is one of those movies that people probably regret years later that they made. full of awful racist jap talk and jokes, this east end kids story details how the kids want to join the military to defeat the japs. since they're too young, they decide to clean the town out of those dastardly japs. they find one, throw fruit at it (without anyone doing anything to stop them) and he pulls a short sword out to menace them! the cops say to stop annoying him! he's only chinese! he's on our side! when the kids go back to apologize, the chinese man's dead! it's all part of this huge jap and german spy ring! the kids see to it that this is stopped at all costs! i'm sure all of this was fine when it was made (1942) but viewed now, you realize of course, that this is clearly a product of it's time. full of stereotypes, german and japanese. funny how the east end kids have a black kid in the group, and he's not spared either. gee whiz.

a very disappointing film from oliver stone which, unlike his recent epic "j.f.k.", fails to stimulate any sort of real emotion. "talk radio" is about talk-back host 'barry champlain', a very loud, opinionated man who manages to upset a lot of people and yet still draw an audience, most of whom mind you just want to ring up and abuse him. his boss in the movie (alec baldwin) sums up his character very well by saying he's just a shoe salesman with a big mouth. and as barry (eric bogosian) gets death threat upon death threat, the final outcome is almost inevitable.this is the sort of movie that usually has something very powerful to say. however, "talk radio" fails to make a serious comment and remains a frustrating, pointless film.thursday, september 17, 1992 - video

the most remarkable thing about "talk radio" is how bad it is. the callers' voices all have a phony, reading-from-a-script ring to them. an evening with an annoying loudmouth at a dallas radio station is told with the portentousness of a sartrean glimpse into hell. stone tries for an existential revelation and gets unintended comedy instead. whenever a caller makes a "profound" (empty) point about something, stone shoves the camera at one of his character's face as they are stricken with some traumatic realization that is never revealed to the audience. bogosian overacts throughout in one of the most irritating performances ever smeared onto celluloid. underrated classic? give me a break.

the 33 percent of the nations nitwits that still support w. bush would do well to see this movie, which shows the aftermath of the french revolution and the terror of 1794 as strikingly similar to the post 9/11 socio-political landscape. maybe then they could stop worrying about saving face and take the a**-whupping they deserve. it's really a shame that when a politician ruins the country, those who voted for him can't be denied the right to ever vote again. they've clearly shown they have no sense of character.what really stands out in this movie is the ambiguity of a character as hopelessly doctrinaire as robespierre; a haunted empty man who simplistic reductive ideology can't help him elucidate the boundaries between safety and totalitarianism. execution and murder. self-defense and patriotism. his legalistic litmus tests aggravate the hopeless situation he's helped create. sound like any belligerent, overprivileged, retarded yale cheerleaders you know of? wojciech pszoniak blows the slovenly deparidieu off the screen. as sympathetic as robespierres plight is, it's comforting to know that shortly after the film ends he'll have his jaw shot off and be sent to the guillotine.

i've just been at the cinema in down town prague watching this film. not due to the poster i found very holywood old-fashioned heroicstyle. not due to the high level starring which remind me that mostof those high starring french films are usually pathetic. but justbecause there are not so many films in my french mother tongue in acity like prague. and because i love adjani, depardieu and rappenau'scyrano. then i decided to write up this small comment because i thinki really don't agree with the comment main stream on this film on imdb.i was not disappointed. the film just look like the poster. thecharacters are just as stupid as they look like. for a while ithought adjani would be like a caricature -- just a funny characteryou can laugh at. no she is not! for example when she decides to telldepardieu she is the one who murdered the fat one she killed at thebeginning of the film then come the violins in a big fat patheticmusic which should make you cry and realize adajani's character is adeeper person as she looks like. maybe this was humor at the 10thlevel but i am sorry my sense of humor is not that high! if i want tosee some funny french film on the wwii i watch once again la grandevadrouille! it is definitively more fun! i have also read on imdbthat lemoine is making a great performance in this film. i have tosay i have never seen a so bad acting! (well i have never seen any edwood's film). nevertheless the film is good filmed with a lot of good(very costly) scenes like the one with the pantheon in the morningwhen the german army arrives at paris or when the refugees settle downon a bridge in bordeaux. i think rappeneau is a good filmmaker butthat he does better with a good script. it was easy with cyrano. hehad not to write the dialogs!i give 1/10.

billed as a romantic comedy set against the early years of wwii it fails to deliver. the problem is that while beautifully photographed it has no consistent story line or narrative. starting as a murder mystery it offers no hope to its actors as it meanders through recent history. depardieu is wasted in a trivial role he obviously is not comfortable with playing. adjani cannot carry the picture. the hero is not; obviously an imitation of a hitchcock "wrongly accused" role it lacks balance. neither heroic, comic nor suspenseful.this could have been a good film. i am reminded of "the lady vanishes" which did combine suspense, romance and comedy in a serious film dealing with fascism.

can this "film" be considered as a film? imagine the situation: somebody puts a handy cam over a tripod and in front of a sea promenade and film people walking or jogging along it. then, he places the camera in a beach, buys some ducks in a pet shop, open their cages and let them run in front of the camera. later, he just films the water surface and the sound of birds and insects in an absolute darkness. is it an experiment or just an insult to the audience intelligence? what would it happen if any unknown director did a film like that? would we mark his job with 10? i always disappoint directors who believe that can do everything they want once they became famous.

coming from kiarostami, this art-house visual and sound exposition is a surprise. for a director known for his narratives and keen observation of humans, especially children, this excursion into minimalist cinematography begs for questions: why did he do it? was it to keep him busy during a vacation at the shore? "five, 5 long takes" consists of, you guessed it, five long takes. they are (the title names are my own and the times approximate): "driftwood and waves". the camera stands nearly still looking at a small piece of driftwood as it gets moved around by small waves splashing on a beach. ten minutes."watching people on the boardwalk". the camera stands still looking at the ocean horizon and a boardwalk. people walk across the camera frame, their faces too far and blurry to make them interesting. eleven minutes."six dogs at the water's edge". the camera stands still looking at the ocean horizon with a sandy stretch of beach nearby. far away at the water's edge, six dogs not doing much, just relaxing. sixteen minutes."ducks in line, gaggle of ducks". the camera stands still looking at the ocean horizon near the water's edge. dozen and dozen of ducks stream in single file from left to right. i assume that kiarostami released them gradually. the last two ducks stop dead on their track and suddenly a gaggle of ducks rolls quietly from right to left. i assume kiarostami collected the ducks and re-released all at the same time. it is not the first time that he deals with the contrast between organized and disorganized behavior. eight minutes."frog symphony, oops, i mean cacophony, for a stormy night". the camera stands over a pond at night. it's pitch black except for what appears to be the reflection of the moon on the undulating water. it is a stormy night and clouds race to cover the moon. the screen goes dark. what remains for us is the cacophony of frogs, howling dogs and, eventually, morning roosters. hit me on the head if this was done in a single take. i saw this segment as a sound composition put together in the editing room and accompanied by a simple visualization. twenty seven minutes! except for the mildly amusing ducks, this exercise in minimalism left me cold. a nonessential film for kiarostami admirers.i thought i would rate "five" a five, but four is what it deserves.the film is dedicated to yasujiru ozu.

well, i generally like iranian movies, and after having seen "10" by kiarostami the night before, i was expecting a great movie. i was very disappointed. this is by far, the worst iranian film, and one of the most boring asian movies i have ever seen. if you have never seen a kiarostami movie before, watch "ten" instead. if you want some good iranian movies, you may also try "sib", aka "the apple". this movie is divided in 5 parts, and only the fourth, featuring some funny ducks, is worth watching. if this is the first iranian movie you see, you probably won't want to see any more. i don't blame you, but you will miss some great movies.

i believe that this movie was a terrible waste of my time, and i would know after watching it 5 times in class. this movie does not show what absolutely perfectly happened during these times. no one can truly say that these things happened to the letter. if anything the only good part would be the actors, even tho that they were really really crap.they were reading the script without expression. quite boring. i would rather watch play school. so i would definitely like to never ever see this movie again in my whole life. it is a complete waste of time unless you want your time to be wasted and if you would like to see an unrealistic view of what happened back in 1981.

i suppose that in 1997 hollywood wasn't quite at the point of openly celebrating homosexuality, so one might want to give some credit to those who put this movie together for having shown a little bit of courage. one simply wishes that credit could be given them for having put together a really good movie, and in my opinion "in & out" doesn't qualify on that count. it's the story of howard brackett (kevin kline) - a small town high school english teacher who on the eve of his wedding is outed by a former student who happens to win an oscar and who then has to go through what can only be described as a period of self-discovery as he comes to terms with being homosexual. to me, that was the first problem with this movie. howard didn't really have to turn out to be gay. the movie would have been funnier (and perhaps even more thought provoking) had brackett remained defiantly straight in spite of the stereotypically gay aspects to his life and the town's belief after the oscar speech that he was gay. (in fact, i thought that identifying him as gay given the presence of those stereotypes might actually have been rather insulting to the gay community, as well as to straight men who like poetry and believe in dressing neatly!) kline was decent enough in the role, and largely carried the film. aside from him, most of the other cast members (although fine actors) were people not really noted for their success on the big screen. folks like tom selleck and wilford brimley and bob newhart are good actors but not big movie stars. i actually thought that the funniest (if very small) role in the movie was that of the super model sonya, played by an actress named shalom harlow (speaking of stereotypes, i loved her oh-so stereotypical model line "i promised to do that photo shoot this afternoon. i have to shower and vomit!") in the end, what really turned me off about this movie was the ridiculous ending, starting with the graduation ceremony (and, to be honest, even if someone decided that the graduation was really necessary, the movie should have ended there, rather than proceeding on with the totally unnecessary nuptials at the end.) basically, i got a few chuckles out of this but nothing more. 3/10

maybe i expected too much of this film, but at the very least a comedy should be funny, and this one has very few amusing moments. it manages to be insulting to homosexuals, heterosexuals, women, the obese, and probably several other groups as well. the scene at graduation where _everyone_ claims to be gay is one of the most distasteful i have ever seen.tom selleck and matt dillon are ridiculously miscast and kevin kline seems bemused most of the time.other reviewers compare the film to "will and grace", but at least "will and grace" _is_ funny.

in & out made me want to vomit. i have never seen such a shameless film! it seriously wanted to say that being gay is something wonderful and joyous, but has no idea how to say it. to me this was not a comedy, unless cruel,sick jokes are something to laugh at when a victim falls for it. from what i saw, this film had four (4) major flaws starting with (a) matt dillion's character as he announces to the world that is former teacher, howard brackett (kevin kline) is gay. never mind how unbelievable it is that matt dillion character won an oscar for what looked like a serious role on the edge of a crack-up. but why would he say such a thing? after all, this was never an issue with howard's students, his friends, family, nor his finace. nobody. so why would he say something like it when it wasn't true? more to the point, why doesn't the movie supply us with an answer as to why he said it? the reason is because there is no answer, and for the convenience of the plot none is provided. the second (b) flaw is with the fact the film seems to have forgotten what homosexuality is--the attraction and sexual relation to members of the same sex. in this movie, being gay is based on liking barbara streisand musicals and being passionate about literature. it's all based on stereotypes!both of these flaws are met up again at that must-be-seen-to-be-believed graduation ceremony. matt dillion finds out about the commotion going on in that small town and the film looks poised to let us know what made him say such a thing. when he arrives to the ceremony, he says nothing, and i wondered why in the world he then came there at all. he didn't solve anything. then when all of the audience stood to announce they were gay, i was so moved i wanted to throw up! those folks were standing up in defense of howard being gay by mocking all of those stereotypes. what the film forgot is that it was using those stereotypes to show why howard was gay. they filmmakers just shot themselves in the foot! but wait there's more!during the ceremony,(c) howard appeared to be on trial to lose is job as a teacher, because people believed that he would influence his students to be gay. what the film was trying to say is that homosexuals never recruit, and that he wouldn't influence his students. but did we not see tom selleck's character endlessly pressure howard over and over again, even to the point of kissing him unexpectedly, to come out of the closet when, in my mind, there was no closet to come out of? from that, the film clearly show that homosexual are capable of recruiting. the film, again, then shoots itself in the foot.and (d) when howard came out of the closet, did anyone not notice how the screenplay shut him up for the rest of the film? i counted only three lines he had afterwards: "yup!" to his parents, "hi there!" to a student, and "are you ready?" to tom selleck before the last vomitous scene. i might be low by one, but the point is he is not allowed to tell us what made him decide he was gay. i wanted to know what was in his head, because i never for once believed he was gay.as bonuses, the movie also includes several truly offensive scenes. one in which howard is asking a priest in confession for advice about what to do for a friend (him), who is engaged and has not yet had sex with his fiance. "does that make him gay?" he asks. the priest responsed "oh yes, he's definitely gay". uh-huh. or what about the scene when all the old ladies are gathered around telling howard's mother that she doesn't need to be sad about her son's deep, dark secret because, well...everyone has them. then one the ladies confessed that she's never seen "the bridges of madison county". funny? no! becuase the film shows that it is insensitive and has no idea how devestating it can be to family to have one of its members announced that he/she is gay. i know. i have several friends that are gay, and none of their families took it well at all. that was a poor way to diffuse the whole situation.the last straw for me was the last scene that gave they appearence that tom and kevin were getting married. the camera panned down very slowly to the front of the church when... it wasn't what you thought! i had been thoroughly disgusted by that point, and i never could forgive that sick joke. i have nothing against films about being gay or homosexuality. "philadelphia" and "longtime companion" were very honest and true in what they had to say. "in & out" is just screaming for political correctness, but has no idea of the corruption at its core. what i gathered from the film is that if you are 99% straight and 1% gay, meaning if you have the slightless doubt, you are definitely gay. it's like gayness is becoming a dominant trait in genetics. in reality if everyone told you over and over that you were worthless and stupid, you would eventually believe it too, wouldn't you? this is what happened to howard brackett about being gay. i left the theater sad and angry. angry the whole weekend, in fact. this was a seriously sick and cruel film, the worst of 1997.

well, where to start describing this celluloid debacle? you already know the big fat nada passing as a plot, so let's jut point out that this is so pc it's offensive. hard to believe that frank oz, the same guy that gave us laugh riots like little shop of horrors and bowfinger, made this unfunny mess.so, this guy doesn't know he's gay till this actor points it out. ok, sure. if anyone ever says i'm gay, i'll know the truth, even if i currently like girls more than george luca$ likes a dollar.and how to know the true nature of my sexuality? well, if i like classic litterature, dancing and barbra streisand, i'm gay. if i dress like a blind man in a hurry (with half my shirt hanging out), i'm straight. oh, sure.and here's the big cliché of clichés: no matter how you look, there's always a very attractive hollywood actor who'll adore every bit of grease under your skin, or a top model who'll love your zero iq, your butt-ugly face and your pointing-out ears. if all those gay common places weren't enough to get me angry, this did. in real world looks matter, folks, and i know for sure.i see it coming: now you'll say "relax! it's a comedy! don't take it so seriously!". if being a comedy gives anything "carte blanche" to suck out loud, i think the world has a serious problem. wouldn't be much better (and funnier) to make a movie to denegate those old tiresome clichés, instead of magnifying them over and over again?so, one of the absolutely worst movies i've ever seen. 1 out of 10. if giving this rating has something to do with my sexual tendence, please let me know. i'm interested.

this movie's basic premise is that everyone in the world can know that a person is gay except for that person. and that a man who likes show tunes, has good taste, and is neat in appearance must be a homosexual. yes, the movie is funny in parts, but the basic premise is to homophobic and insulting that the entire movie crumbles into something that is quite painful to sit through. the performances, particularly joan cusak and kevin kline are very good.

i found this film to be extremely homophobic... the main character doesn't know he's gay until he realizes that he likes barbra streisand and has a limp wrist!!! i was so offended that after the screening at the toronto film festival, i went up and spoke to the screen writer to complain about this film. this is the sort of film that glaad needs to work to have banned.

* terrible * * below par * * * not bad * * * * good * * * * * brilliantwarning *minor spoilers*homosexuality these day's is hardly the taboo subject it was over forty years ago.however it must be said that perhaps more so in america than say, over here in the u.k. it can still be a touchy subject.just look at the whole debacle of gay's in the millitary some years ago in the us.it's with 'in and out' that writer paul rudnick taps in to the small town mentality of middle america and the way the press in the us (as well as in the uk) make such a big deal in outing a celebrity.you need only look at when will young and stephen gately of boyzone came out of the closet.the movie centres on howard brackett(kevin kline), a high school english teacher in his home town.the local people are preparing themselves for oscar night as one of the nominees cameron drake(matt dillon) came from their town and was a former pupil of howards. cameron, who plays a gay soldier in a vietnam epic wins the award only to out howard as being gay during his acceptance speech.this could not come at a worse time for howard who is just day's away from marrying his fiance and fellow school teacher emily(joan cusack).as you would expect the media reaction is cataclysmic and turn's howards life upside down.not only does he try to convince his family and friends that he is not gay but evade sleazy news reporter, peter malloy(tom selleck).although this was billed as a screwball comedy it's clear that rudnick and director frank oz are also attempting to be satirical.you only have to look at the early scenes at the oscars cerimonee and the way the people of bracketts home town as well as the teaching board of the school react to his outing.sadly the film doesn't live up to the promise we see early on in the movie.this is a pretty flat attempt to make social commentary out of a wacky comedy.a good cast is sadly wasted on a script that never really delivers the nessecary amount of laughs and is no where near as insightful as it thinks it.kline gives us the same kind of endearing performance that he gave us in his earlier comedy 'dave', making howard an instantly likeable character. cusack too is good value as howard's weight obsessed fiance while tom selleck play's very well against type as a gay news reporter.bob newhart is a joy also, as the principal of the high school where howard works.it's great to see him on the big screen for a change.it's a shame that it had to be this.the performances as good as they are can do little to rescue the movie from being a rather dull affair.while a couple of scenes do offer some amusement.namely the inspired scene where howard attempts to make himself seem more manly by listening to a self help tape.there is little to enjoy, and when things can't seem to get any worse rudnick resorts to a sickening finale that lurches in to over the top sentiment. i also couldn't help but feel that my intelligence was being insulted.malloy appears to be too sleazy a character to become the man who put's his ethics before getting a good story while cammeron finally come to the rescue in the film's climax seems at first to be too self involved a character to care a jot about what happens to his former teacher.after all it's he who caused all the trouble in the first place.'in and out' isn't exactly dire.but when you consider the likes of klines better work like 'a fish called wanda' you can't help but feel that here is a great talent being sadly wasted.robs rating:* *

i'm rather surprised that anybody found this film touching or moving.the basic premise of the film sounded to me like an excellent, if provocative, idea for a movie about a rare sort of relationship, but one (if i can judge by the real-life examples i've known) is extremely deep and loving.however, the film is cheaply scripted--poorly scripted--and although it has a number of very pretty-looking shots, i didn't find it to be anything special.probably the biggest problem is that it is far too short and poorly-composed to give its audience time enough to invest, emotionally, in the characters: we don't really care about any of them, and so their stresses and obstacles don't really touch us.i think a remake--from the screenplay up--with some character development by some really good writers--could improve it greatly. it is instructive to compare this film with brokeback mountain, which the screen-writers took to far loftier levels than did the author of the screenplay--screen-writers who were clearly conscious of how to write a classical tragedy, and carried out their task with care, planning, and superb craftsmanship! however, people only seem to remake those films that don't need it! you're not really missing anything if you skip this one: i found it very disappointing indeed, and it is only saved from getting a 1-star from me by virtue of the daring and gumption it took to make a film on this sensitive subject.

stay the hell away from this one... no, really i'm serious - i know you might think this is a fun, campy, cheesy hong kong action style b movie. i did, but trust me, it's not. in fact, the only thing accurate about that description would be the words hong kong, and then only used in a strictly geographical sense.yes, donnie yen has co-directed it. jackie chan has a cameo. the guy ekin cheng, from storm riders plays the lead. it got vampires. it should be good - or at least fun, charming and action packed. once again - it's not.i could digress on why this movie sucks - i could dissect it, hack it to tiny, shivering pieces. but where to start? there's so much to hate...to make it easier, and to give this hate-fest some credability, let me say that i'm usually a big fan of hog kong cinema. the heavier drama stuff as well as the more lighthearted action and/or comedy.the really good movies as well as the really cheesy ones. i can sit through hours of bad subtitling, jokes lame enough to make first graders roll their eyes. i can handle lovers as chaste and celibate as a convention of nuns, that and pretty much anything else the average film goer would bang their metaphorical toes against on their way between action sequences. also, hong kong or any other origin - i love it when a movie goes from just being bad to bad enough to be good.but this - arrgh! it's just horrible, stupid, unwatchable garbage. so far from being funny or charming it's actually painful. so derived of action it makes a bergman movie look like the texas chainsaw massacre.why?! why waste such an opportunity?! this could have been so much fun!

i saw this movie in blockbuster and thought it might be a good sunday evening movie when there is nothing else to do. so i bought it used, 3 dvds for $25. although it was cheap, my money would have been better spent on a nail to drive through my foot.the film started out nicely. kinda dark and mysterious. i was always enthralled with vampire and samurai movies as a kid. i thought the combo would be really cool. the first fight scene was pretty cool. i was excited for the rest of the movie. then the movie took a serious nose dive.i understand that this was a big hit in the east. i guess because of the twins. i don't see it though. this movie, aside from the first 10 minutes, was absolutely horrible. so many movies in this genre have the potential to be great, and blow it terribly. this is just another casualty.jacki chan's role in this film doesn't make any sense at all. whyyyyyyyy? complete silliness. he probably made a few bucks off it though.the only cool thing in this movie are the swords they use. nice idea.i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.

"the twins effect" is the worst movie i've seen! not only is the support weak, but the characters as well. i'm sorry to say to you edison fans, but kazaf is by far the weakest vampire i've seen in my life. i'm sorry edison; your role in this movie was disappointing. edison does not fight whatsoever in this movie and i'm sure if they didn't have kazaf in the movie, the plot wouldn't be much different. the main plot in the movie is not explained nearly enough and the entire movie focused too much on helen and kazaf's growing relationship. i mean, who the hell was kazaf and why did they need his blood? yeah, he's the prince right? so what!certain scenes in this movie were just plain stupid. yeah, the action was great but the entire outline of it was stupid. in one scene towards the end, duke dekotes says that kazaf is the strongest of his brothers... yeah it would seem so now that he's full grown. why would you wait until he's grown up to attack? another scene was with jackie chan, one of my personal favorites. in the scene, jackie asked helen who were the creatures that persistently followed them. how can you be so naive as to not know that they are vampires? people are dying around them with bite marks on their necks; surely the news would be on it faster than you can say "vampire."the characters were yet another mistake in the movie. helen, played by charlene choi, is the girlfriend of kazaf. what kind of girl would not be scared of vampires, especially if it is your brother's job to kill them? i can bet you that you would not find such a brave girl as helen if you searched your whole life. helen is annoying, bitchy, and is a total drama queen in the movie. she tries too hard to be different and in the end fails miserably. one of the weirdest and most disturbing characters i've seen in any movie. why would you bite someone's neck especially if you're not a vampire? it's very odd that her reaction to kazaf's confession doesn't turn him off. kazaf, played by edison chen, is another stupid character in the story. how degrading for a young actor as himself to play in a movie with such a poorly constructed role. he does not stand up for himself throughout the movie and does not fight. although i'm a fan of edison, i wouldn't want a man who lies on the ground the whole time. gypsy and reeve are my favorite characters in the movie. their love is pure and sweet. gypsy is gorgeous and does not try too hard like helen. reeve, played by ekin cheng, is wise and seems to be the only person that makes sense in the movie. a plot failure was the death of reeve. the movie had absolutely no substance yet it doomed itself by removing one of the only likable characters. another character was duke dekotes. the story didn't focus much on him and therefore made his desire to obtain kazaf's "rock" seem irrelevant.it's very sad because towards the end of the movie, i was forcing myself to watch because i so desperately wanted to see kazaf fight. the end was so abrupt because the whole time i was expecting so great to happen. kazaf, who's the supposed vampire prince, does nothing for the movie and i'm sure if he were taken out, the movie wouldn't be much different. i highly recommend you to not waste your time on this movie as i have. i was greatly disappointed. if you're in search of a great movie, why not watch "lord of the rings" or "pirates of the caribbean?" likeable characters with a well-written plot.

at first i thought it was bad because i had great expectations for this movie, but after giving some thought it is that bad. i was almost caught up in hk's promotion of bad stars in bad movies. hk's new generation of actors and actresses not to mention bad script writers are bringing the industry down. at the moment im still trying to figure out how it gross so high. normally you cant lose in a movie with donnie yen and ekin (forget jackie, he's past his peak). but then i shouldve figure it out when twins was on the cover. it is cheesy, campy, very corny, i try to laugh from some of the jokes, but not only is the effect very minimal but the jokes are very recycled and not funny. im sorry i bought the movie. the only reason why some people think it is so good is because they are brainwashed into the hype that the twins are cute, and everybody likes them, and that everything they make is good and funny. and that if you like twins, then you are up to date...sigh... i miss the good hk movie days when jet li and stephen chow movies dominated the box office...movies from mainland china are much better than this, and they are shot for lower budgets.

to identify this movie as a vampire movie would be technically correct. simply because it will suck the life right out of you.vampire effect is an insult to movie-buffs everywhere. the plot is almost non-existent. the make-up is just plain awful. and the acting is just not there.i have to wonder if jackie chan owed someone a huge favor to be convinced to appear in this film.my wife picked up the movie at the rental store because it had a picture of jackie chan on the front (as though he was playing the lead) and thought that a good jc flick would be fun to watch. this movie was interesting to watch in the same way that you can't help staring at the car wreck when you drive by. you realize very quickly the movie isn't going to get any better but, you keep watching wonder just how bad it will get.

twins effect is a poor film in so many respects. the only good element is that it doesn't take itself seriously. other than that, this is not really a movie, but rather a merchandising tool for the film's two stars, popular pop idols in their native hong kong.the film itself is poorly constructed and acted. the direction offers up some silly martial arts, which is odd since the action director (and supposedly co-director) is donnie yen. like many hong kong films geared for the teen audience, the major fanbase of "actors" like the twins (the two girls who stars in this film) and ekin cheng, there is so much bad music to prod the audience into believing certain scenes are funny, clever, etc.the final conclusion: it's all for naught. even as a fan of hong kong movies, this is a poor film. not funny enough, not serious enough, and just generally too bubble gum fake for its own good.3 out of 10.(go to http://www.nixflix.com for a more in-depth review of this movie and other foreign films)

now really can u call that a movie. i knew some of the movies that japanese people do are good for nothing but this bad? i mean com'om i fell a sleep three times at this movie. no horror at all, some tiny percent (0.2-0.5) comedy. action let's just admit that it has some but the scenes are poorly filmed, the actors are pathetic. none of the actors did a good job in it's own role. the were not convincing. the script is also awful. i mean this movie may be great, really, but for the 60's(in not 100% sure.) i recommend not to see it, unless you want to get so bored as i did. i can't quite figure hot this movie got it's rating. it's over, over, over rated!!!. this is a personal opinion of course. i don want to offend anyone but who could like this crap? so i hope this helps someone not to loose some time "enjoying" this movie. nevertheless it's your choice!

this movie reminds me of harry potter - not the style but the marketing strategy. there may be part 2 , part three...until one day the product life cycle finishs, of course on the condition that the part one has a commercial success. so many things seems to be hidden and thus the story looks quite incomplete. the action design is boring. set design is ok but not fine. perhaps edison chen would be a big star one day. he really looks charming even on big screen. the most impressive is still anthony wong. 4/10

the movie starts off with reeve (ekin) and his assistant fighting same vampires. this scene is probably the best out of the entire movie. the rest of the movie unfortunately is cheesy, highly unrealistic and a buffy the vampire slayer ripoff. the ending also sucks big time.some moments such as the scene where gypsy and helen (played by popular chinese duo band twins: charlene & gillian) fight over a stuffed teddy bear are particularly cringeworthy. the storyline is also lame, surely they could have come up with something more scary than a book called "day for night".some good parts though. jackie chan and anthony wong make the movie bearable with their comical roles. however, the good bits just end there. charlene & gillian (from twins) have never been able to act well and annoy you to pieces and "the friendly but wussy vampire" role was unfortunately given to edison chen who is a talentless pretty boy. rating: 4/10 --

oh, man, talk about the effect of advertising. apparently, all that you have to do to enjoy box office succes is title your movie after a revered 19th century novel. horrendous acting, directing, and cinematography in this sham of an effort.

1st watched 2/18/2007 - 4 out of 10(dir-leon leonard): fair adventure movie based on a novel by the author of moby dick fame, herman melville. this movie is about the captain of a ship who had stolen the eyes(that were extremely rare black pearls) from a native tribe's god sculpture and hidden them somewhere that only he knew about before leaving the island of tivi. he got very sick and was on a secret voyage to go back to the island to retrieve the pearls for himself while others(like his daughter) thought that he was going back to be treated by the local medicine man. others didn't know the reason for the voyage. a stowaway actually knew the real reason for the trip -- to return the eyes to their god. the silly part is that the pearls were hidden very close to the statue and all this time the natives ran their tribe without their god having eyes(causing them all kinds of problems). along the way, we are treated(for some reason) to a short underwater nature show with an electric eel fighting a local octopus(i guess only herman melville knows what this was all about). once they get to the island, the captain dies but passes the whereabouts of the pearls to his daughter but she also gets the sickness curse as well. one of the bad guys finds out where the god is housed and convinces the daughter to go there and steal back the pearls but at this point the good guys find out what's going on and a fight ensues. i won't tell you the results of the fight or the ending, i'll leave that up to you to find out if you want. as i said earlier, the movie was ok, but some very silly things that i've already mentioned lessened it's impact. i wonder if that new "pirates of the caribbean" got some of it's plot from this one ---hmm black pearls, a curse( i wonder) well, it doesn't matter, those elements didn't make for a very good movie in this case or the other. it seems they would learn they're lesson, but with the money rolling in on that newer movie i'm sure they won't. oh well.

probably one of the worst movies ever made, i'm still trying to figure if it was meant to be fun, but for sure i had no fun at all. maybe the movie lost something during the english-italian translation, dunno, for sure i miss the guts to watch it again in original version.my rate for it 2/10, and i feel like i'm being pretty generous (let's say 1 point is for liv cause she's a nice babe, and the other point is for those decent actors that got trapped into a worthless, useless and pathetic movie)take carealex

the intertwined points-of-view can come up as a good idea in some movies. here it is a total mess.but the total mess begin with the story: a video-clip bummy wants to shoot a light comedy with a pernicious noir-like female character. she is gorgeous and no men could resist to dive and crawl and suck her toes. she is all the more materialist, looking as if butter wouldn't melt in her mouth.the movie does melt away in its own pretentiousness: being smart/funny/good-looking. phalocretinism at his best. white trash only, please.

this was really the worst movie i've ever seen. anyone who has seen it will know what i'm talking about. i saw it on starz, so thank goodness i didn't waste my money. please everyone, don't waste your time. i'm really suprised this wasn't straight to video.

wow. i watched one night at mccool's yesterday, and all i can say is, "wow."here i go. major spoilers.would you like a summary of the plot, just to see how stupid and pointless this movie is? i would never tell anybody to watch it, unless i was out to inflict pain upon them. anyway, here's a glimpse (or a huge chunk) of the plot.randy works for a bar, mccool's. he meets up with this woman named jewel who convinces him to, surprisingly, have sex with him. her ex-boyfriend ends up trying to rob them and gets killed. randy and his cousin and the detective at the scene of the crime all fall for jewel. she, being the mascot of stupidity, uses every one of these guys to get what she wants, involving a dvd player. randy hires a hit man to kill her, and eventually the detective is killed by the ex-boyfriend's psycho brother and the hit man and jewel take off.seriously. that's it. i left hardly anything out, except for a few more sex scenes and a nearly-pornographic scene of liv tyler as jewel using a hose to flaunt her sexuality.what was the point of this movie? to be honest, i think it was so that the producers and directors could show off their male urges. which i think is absolutely uncalled for and just plain stupid. when i watch a movie, i want a plot. i want characters. i don't care about sexy woman flaunting anything they might have. something should happen in a movie, for goodness' sake. this is as bad as fight club.it gets even worse. john goodman is the detective devoted to the higher being. i myself wondered why goodman would play in something so outrageously pitiful as this, but then i remembered that he was in o brother, where art thou? as well. his reputation just went down a notch.liv tyler was an amazing actress in the lord of the rings series. in this movie she is nothing more than an unintelligent slut who wants nothing but her way. her reputation has gone down seven or eight notches, to me.i am amazed, simply amazed that people would work so hard to make something so stupid. the music is absolutely crappy (having "ymca" play while john goodman's character is being killed doesn't really fit), the characters are totally unlikeable, the plot is one of the most stupid ever conceived by man, and to top it off, it doesn't even fit into any genre. the closest it gets to is pornographic comedy. if it was even supposed to be funny. which it wasn't.i think i'm done ranting now. but let me just assure you that nobody in their right mind would ever, ever want to see this movie. unless they lust for liv tyler as much as the characters do, that is.

i saw a great clip of this film, which i'll talk about later, and then the cast list, and thought i might as well give it a go. basically, a down-on-his-luck bartender, randy (matt dillon), his cocky cousin carl harding (paul reiser) and murder investigation detective dehling (john goodman) all have something in common, they have seen the girl of their dreams (whether married or not), and they would do anything to please and be with her, even die. all three met/saw her "one night at mccool's", the bar that randy worked at, they have no knowledge of each other, but all three cannot stop thinking of femme fetale jewel valentine (the lord of the rings' liv tyler). all three are telling their stories to someone they hope will listen to their pretty intense and revealing stories, randy talks to hit-man mr. burmeister (michael douglas, who co-produced the film), carl to psychologist/psychiatrist dr. green (reba mcentire) and dehling to priest father jimmy (richard jenkins). they confess all details of what they have been willing to do, their sexual contact with her, and eventually they are all brought together in one place, all intent on being with her, and all involved with the final shootout that leaves one dead, one running away (and eventually dying) and one stunned, and the unexpected guy she chooses (but at the same time obvious, cos it's sex-obsessed douglas). also starring andrew dice clay as utah/elmo and sandy martin as bingo vendor woman. if i had to pick a favourite moment, it would definitely be what was mentioned at number 11 along with cool hand luke on the 100 greatest sexy moments, where tyler copycats the woman washing the car with suds all over herself, and in front of goodman, very sexy! apart from that, not the most memorable film. okay!

i'm watching this horrid film as we speak. it is possibly one of the worst movies ever aired in my house. i'm sitting here with 3 friends and they agree. its not scary. its not funny. its not dramatic. it contains nothing appealing whatsoever. we are 49 minutes in the movie. we've only seen 2 critters. only one person has died. this movie is one big letdown. nothing about this horrible, horrible movie has made me want to watch the rest. i'm getting a movie hang over. i hope that everyone who had anything to do with making this movie dies. i don't just mean the actors. i mean the director, producers, the presidents from the studio that financed this movie. it is in full, the worst movie ever. it should make the imdb worst 100 movies of all time. at number 1.

anybody who thinks this film is great, desperately needs their head seen to. it strikes me that this film was made as a joke. it has no good points whatsoever. the props cost about $10 and the entire set looks like it could fall down at any time. why do films like this get made in the first place? this also had two of the most annoying characters i have ever come across in the young boy on the spaceship and the redneck from the twentieth century. this film is almost as bad as "cool as ice" starring the incredibly talented vanilla "misunderstood" ice.

ok. well, i guess it was worth my time sitting through this *once* but i won't be watching it again. there are several things about this film that irritated me.first, man...i really hated the characters. i had the same problem with sid and nancy. i have a hard time rationalizing spending a fair chunk of time following characters who i really don't care about, and can't relate to. it's not that the actors or the writing were technically bad; it was that the characters were written in such a way that i just had contempt for them, and as the movie went on, i almost wanted to see the sky fall on them. and this leads me to the second problem, and a question which i think is at the heart of this movie: was the intent to simply document this generation and these types of bohemians who were (i guess) wandering around europe in the 60s? was the intent to criticize and lambaste them? or was this film some kind of a warning? my final assessment of the film (that is to say, in determining if there was anything salvageable here at all) hinges on this question.regardless, these characters are really unlikeable, and as a consequence, it's hard to really give a crap about the plot or what happens to them. if this was some sort of statement on this generation, then the film becomes a little more tolerable. it is clear that schroeder is not some kind of geriatric establishment square, so the way he proceeds here carries more weight than, say, the countless stupid aip films set in or concerning the 60s counterculture.at bare minimum, this film has two things going for it - first, the soundtrack (obviously). i like how cymbaline is used here and others have mentioned it too, as it takes the forefront in the movie. i am guessing that if you are a pink floyd fan and want to see it for that reason, nothing you read here is likely to stop you from watching it anyway (it wouldn't stop me either). the curiosity of hearing pink floyd in a movie may be enough to just barely get you through this.secondly, there is some nice scenery. ibiza looks like a nice place to visit. maybe i'm just sick of looking at los angeles, new york, and chicago in films, but european films which take the time to actually show us europe (the beautiful or the ugly - mostly beautiful here) are always welcome.but i really see no particular genius here. no revolutionary camera work, not even a moral, tone, message, sensibility, or plot that has anything new to say. perhaps what was revolutionary about this was merely that it came from a guy like schroeder - a film critical of a mindset that at least in part made his movies marketable. to that extent it is an honest film; there's no glorification of the abject excesses of the 60s here, which is perhaps something you might expect. in fact, the portrayal of the characters in this film closely mirrors the (somewhat distorted, in my opinion) modern cultural memory of that generation.oh yeah, bunch of (yawn) nudity and sex here; nothing new if you watch these kinds of movies from this time period. i guess it was considered novel or provocative or something at the time. i don't find it offensive or titillating (i doubt you will either); rather it just extends the running time of an already tedious film. in its own way, this particular use of sexuality in movies of the time (especially european ones) has become a bit of a cliché. but i guess in hindsight you can't blame them; they were just in that decade able to "get away with it" and i suppose (i'm guessing here) the very presence of this kind of graphic sexuality was a political or social statement in and of itself (that being that sexuality was a part of life that this generation wasn't going to be all weird about like their parents were).should you watch it? if you're a pink floyd fan, sure...i guess it's worth a watch. in any case, the valley is a better film. i went into this movie expecting largely what i got. if you don't normally watch these kinds of arty, avant garde films and don't know what to expect, this is bound to be annoying as hell. this is a normal, healthy reaction :) if you're not a pink floyd fan, i'm not sure why you'd spend your time here. i noticed one fellow who left a comment did enjoy this movie quite a lot, so maybe i'm just missing something. i don't need guys running in slow motion from fireballs, special effects, explosions, or anything like that to enjoy a movie. but i do need some kind of handle - i need to find something to like about a movie, and generally i need to sympathize with some aspect of the characters' plight (barring that some novel film-making will work; camera-work and so forth). here, there's just nothing to hold on to except for pink floyd's magnificence. which is *just enough* to make this tolerable. at bare minimum, if you're a pink floyd fan to begin with, you'll like the bit with cymbaline, i promise.

specks of white and various shapes, a beautiful nude, random images. that is what this little experimental short film is.it's kind of interesting to think how in the early days of film such images could be transferred onto film, but despite my love of a lot of surreal images and films, and a fascination with the bizarre, this film just didn't do it for me.i'm not sorry i watched it, but if there is any underlying meaning in it, i don't get it. visually, it is not that outstanding, in my humble opinion. as an example of dadaism, i suppose it would fit in quite well, since it seems to reject any semblance of logic or reason, though i would have preferred that it do it in a more visually interesting way.but to each his own.

it's nice that these three young directors have produced films with good productions values and decent acting. there's some good work here.unfortunately they suffer from what afflicts much of modern gay cinema; recycled plots, too familiar devices (i have seen the "pool" setting way too many times in gay male films) and hackneyed scripts. most egregious of all is "dorothy" whose preposterous premise is that a cute young guy will have trouble getting laid in nyc due to a shortage of identifiable availabe gay guys in his vicinity.in terms of cinema these shorts play like tacky little gay afterschool specials. not a lot of imagination in their writing or execution; basically they follow a point-and-shoot, shot/reaction shot/master shot convention which becomes painfully dull after five or so minutes. there's hope for queer cinema in the works of todd haynes, sadie benning and the late, great marlon riggs...but not here. these films are incredibly middlebrow, singularly whitebread and their values basically pander to a gay bourgeois sensibility. which is probably why they play so well at gay film festivals.

i have never before voted 1 for a movie on the imdb, but for this one i am sorry the scale doesn't go down to -10.all i can say abou this movie is that i saw it in a sneak preview, and it was my worst movie experience ever. i don't mind the stupid jokes. i can live with the silly story. but when i see those dumbly grinning "main characters" with their pseudo-foreign speech (only germans will understand what i talk about), i felt i kind of loathing i never thought i was capable of. (if they had left them out, the thing may actually have been acceptable...).there's not much more to be said about this one. you may laugh once or twice, because it's so ridiculous, but that doesn't make it any better. it is definitely not funny.if you live outside of germany, be happy and rejoice that this awful work will most likely never make it to your cinemas.if you do live in germany, avoid this movie at all costs.

this is one of the worst movies, i've ever seen. not only, that it is a comedy, which isn't funny, but it's also very badly made with an over the top direction full of unnecessary split screens and other effects.the two "heroes" with their fantasy language are just annoying and it confused me quite a lot, that they touched each others genitals all the time. but the worst of all that nonsense is the cheap attempt to give that movie some appeal, by referring to german history and to show sensitive aspects of the "heroes", which finds its climax in showing how erkan and stefan cure a mentally ill woman with their "joyful" lifestyle (!). but i hadn't expect anything better by director michael "bully" herbig, who also made two not funny tv-shows, a not funny western movie and a nearly not funny sf-comedy movie. but erkan and stefan had been- just a little- better in some of their stand-up programs. for me the only good thing about the movie is alexandra neldel, who is very beautiful to me.

now don't get me wrong, i love seeing half naked chicks wiggling around. it's part of the fun of a moroccan restaurant: ogling the belly dancers. but it doesn't make much of a plot.my first major problem is the music. i have the feeling that when ann rice wrote "the vampire lestat", the cure was more the style of the music he would have liked (though i could be wrong). i know relating to current "goth" music might have seemed like a good idea, but they did a horrific job incorporating it. lestat was an actor with presumably a pretty good singing voice. that they chose jonathan davis to be his stage voice is heartbreaking.second, and someone else said it, mashing two very intricate books into one crappy movie is a bad idea. "lestat" could have been a movie in it's own right, and a damn good one if done right. i honestly don't think "queen of the damned" lends itself to a movie very well. though i would love to see a movie that incorporates a creation story, there's too much, how to word this, "inaction" in the book for it to be a very interesting movie. and the retelling they did soiled it pretty badly. now mind you, it's been a long time since i've read it, i always thought "lestat", "tale of the body thief" and "memnoch the devil" were much more action packed and would have made better movies.i know a lot of people (hey, myself included) who like a lot of cheesy vampire crap that thought this was absolutely the worst of the genre to be a major motion picture. i tend to agree with them there. aaliyah had a nice body though.

this movie was awful, plain and simple! the animation scenes had absolutely terrible graphics. it was very clear to see that this film had about the budget of my grocery bill!! the acting was just as bad.. i've seen better acting in pornographic films. i would seriously like the hour and twenty minutes of my life back. in fact, i registered on imdb just so that other people don't get sucked into watching this like i did. don't get me wrong though, i love sci-fi films! this one seemed more like the intro to a video game :( i'm glad i only spent a dollar to see this one! the story line reminded me of the movie pitch black, a prisoner on a ship in outer space escapes. oh my goodness.. what are we gonna do??? i would not even let this play in the background of my house while i was cleaning! bottom line here, you can do better.

i've got 10 plus year old computer games with better special effects! plot is choppy and very predictable. most of the actors seem like extras with no experience! everyone has scottish accents. it's like watching a crew of 'scotties' from star trek without the personality or charm. needless scenes of people putting up tents! tents with all of the supposedly high tech equipment! actors looking like they were not sure the camera was on them. nothing to make you care if these people survive or not! looks like it was made in someone's backyard and garage using low end equipment! nothing seems original or even slightly entertaining. do not waste your time!

i really didn't like this film~!!!! it was boring and didn't interest me that much at all.. i'm more of an action girl, and it had none. i went and rented this movie because of the other comment that was left.. but was totally mislead! don't get this movie unless you like the dessert and plenty of boredom. i just really didn't like the movie. it wasn't my style, but it could be yours.. you would just have to watch the previews or something but it's my recommendation if you're a girl.. don't get this movie! this scandinavian production draws on some of the observational strategies of godfrey reggio's koyaanisqatsi, allowing us to reflect on patterns and phenomena of human and natural existence from both intimate and sweeping viewpoints. this just isn't for me!

i've just seen this film in a lovely air-conditioned cinema here in bangkok. and since the temperature outside is hovering somewhere around 37c with very high humidity, my 100bt was not wasted.failing that, i haven't seen such a piece of extremely well-made junk in a long time. this is the kind of film that provides a test of taste, as it were. anyone who claims to like or love it goes immediately onto the same list of tasteless phonies who still go around talking about the superiority of british television. at least the gormless old broad in the wheelchair was good for a few guffaws.pseudo-profundity and fat lips, while characteristic of much french cinema, really do not a good movie make. i'd rather watch independence day 10 times in a row than sit through this stinker one more time.

i only bought this dvd because it was dirt cheap and it seemed interesting in its own special way ("special" meaning "retarded"). the movie turned out to be quite uninteresting - boring camera work, nothing really driving the story, and of course the acting is horrible. it wasn't even "bad" in a campy way - it was just plain bad. there are actually a handful of great lines of dialogue but for the most part its awkward and weak. all i could think about while watching this was that this could actually be a good movie if the script was given a major overhaul (if it were written by someone who actually understood drug culture) and if some decent actors were cast. i wouldn't recommend "weekend with the babysitter" unless if you plan on a career in film and want to learn what not to do in a movie.

this movie is not worth the time it takes to put it in the vcr or dvd player! michael dudikoff and lisa howard are two bounty hunters in love, yet they are total opposites. she is ambitious and organized, while he is laid back and totally scatter brained.in this movie, bad guys are chasing jersey bellini (dudikoff's character). this opens the door to bad godfather impressions, ludicrous fight scenes, and tony curtis playing the most effeminate looking mob boss i have ever seen! the ending has to be the most...unbelievable scene i have seen in a movie in quite some time. i would believe the terminator, even the matrix, has a better chance of possibly being true than this ending! this movie just reeks of cheapness. the script had to have hit someone as being totally ridiculous. yet, the green light was given for this piece of dung to be made and let loose on on unsuspecting public. i watched this movie with several other people who all agreed that we had been cheated. no one in the group could say anything good about the film except that it was over.

love sublime says the title. another blurb during the promotions of the film talked about inner vs external beauty. well in this case the beauty - you decide inner or external - is provided by scantily clad (or is that scantily dressed/ undressed) zeenat aman who the director raj kapoor called "a volcano of talent" while the film was being made. one can't accuse him of sarcasm of course - after all he was promoting his own film.the paper thin plot is about a woman with a disfigured face who has a - er - well proportioned body , a great voice (thanks to lata mangeshkar) with whom the hero shashi kapoor falls in love. he doesn't want her face only her voice. the acting is desperate and even the 4 is because of the music with lata mangeshkar giving some good numbers. the rest is of course bunkum. avoid - save your money. inner beauty vs outer beauty. !!! you need not be an einstein to figure out which one the director was concentrating on

aussie shakespeare for 18-24 set.with blood ,blood and more blood.and good dose of nudity. this will not be for every one on may levels, to violent for some too cheap for most. done on low budget they try and do there best but it only works sporadically.and this macbeth just seem to be lacking ,its just not compelling. although there is some good acting on the part of most you don't get into there heads especially mecbeths. the best performance came from gary sweet and the strangest mick molly. if your into shakespeare then see it,but if you like your cheese mature you will love it.it not a bad film but it not that good either. sam peckenpah would of loved it, that is if it was filmed as a western. i was expecting a lot from this, as i loved romper stomper. but this is was a vacant effort.

geoffrey wright, the director of "romper stomper", transplants shakespeare's "macbeth" in the contemporary, criminal underworld of melbourne, australia. the result is a semi-awful piece of cinema. sam worthington is macbeth, and walks around looking very self-conscious and bored. victoria hill, who wrote the script with wright, is lady macbeth, and she's neither awful nor good. lachy hulme, who plays mcduff, is the only actor in the cast who exudes any kind of authority. the rest, including gary sweet, are wasted and misdirected. shot on hd by the late will gibson, the movie's visuals lack character. everything is too clean and too deliberately lit. wright's direction is uninspired in the extreme and the action sequences are confusing and inept. marketed erroneously as "the most violent australia movie ever", the film is violent at times and reasonably bloody, but it fails to deliver a single impactful moment. slow moving and terribly pretentious, this umpteenth silver screen version of the classic play is the personification of wrong-headed.

if you want a horrible interpretation of "macbeth", then this is your answer. filled with archaic shakespearic english language in a 21st century australian setting, this film lives to disappoint and leave you scratching your head. but that isn't all.not only is there sophomoric action sequences but there are plenty of scenes where the female body is displayed. the witches, played by actresses that resemble school girls more than witches, put on a soft porn display with macbeth in a unremarkable display of affection. welcome to stupidity and depravity - all at the same time.its a wonder why this project was green-lighted. so much for modern cheesy movies. "d-"

recap: not entirely familiar with the shakespeare story of macbeth, but my wild guess is that this is pretty close to the original, only set in present time. it tells the story of macbeth, a member of a crime syndicate in melbourne (?). he is a valued hit-man and in the favor of leader duncan. but he and his lady has higher ambitions than that, and plan the murder of duncan, and any competition of the throne. this is a story of betrayal and cold, brutal death.comments: very interesting idea, i must say. to use the story but change the setting to present time, but still keep the original (?) dialog. it sets a huge contrast between the classical poetic work and the violence. promised to be extremely violent, it is a promise that it keeps, but not in the notion i imagined. it is very bloody indeed, but the violence is slow. not just figuratively speaking that it is calculated, which it is too, but also literally. a lot of action is actually slowed down to slow motion and that is what brings the movie to its knees.what could have been a unique strength, the contrast between the superfluous and poetic dialog and the extreme violence, now turns into something else entirely. now both slow the move down painfully much, so much that it actually becomes dull and boring at times.also i can't figure out the context the three witches act within. set to present time and reality i figure that such magical witchcraft had no place in the movie. apparently it does, but to me it seems completely out of place. not a subplot but a complete sub-story with it's own rules, completely different than the rest of the movie. seems completely out of place. surely it must have been possible to convert that part too to something modern. drug-induced hallucinations perhaps (which i suspect that the director hints at but then he has left way too much witchcraft in it to be believable)? now they only bring stretches of the movie that is clearly beside the story and i just waited for the real movie to begin again.a clear disappointment, but maybe something for shakespearean-buffs?4/10

this movie illustrates like no other the state of the australian film industry and everything that's holding it back.awesome talent, outstanding performances (particularly by victoria hill), but a let down in practically every other way.an "adaptation" of sorts, it brought nothing new to macbeth (no, setting it in present-day australia is not enough), and essentially, completely failed to justify its existence, apart from (let's face it, completely unnecessarily) paying homage to the original work. if there's one body of work that has been done (and done and done and done), it's shakespeare's. so any adaptation, if it's not to be a self-indulgent and pointless exercise, needs to at least bring some new interpretation to the work.and that's what this macbeth fails to do. as it was done, this film has no contemporary relevance whatsoever. it's the same piece that we have seen countless (too many!) times before. except with guns and in different outfits.apart from the fundamental blunder (no other way to put it) of keeping the original shakespearian dialogue, one of the more cringeful moments of the movie is the prolonged and incredibly boring slow motion shoot out towards the end, during which i completely tuned out, even though i was looking at the screen. i never thought i had a short attention span, but there you go.i suppose the movie succeeds on its own, very limited terms. but as australia continues to produce world-class acting talent, its movie-makers need to stop being proud of succeeding on limited terms, and actually set high enough standards to show that they respect for the kind of acting talent they work with.a shame. an absolute shame.

the play macbeth was written by william shakespeare between the years of 1604 and 1606. ever since then, many other versions of the play have been produced, including remakes completed in 1948, 1971, and 2006. akira kurosawa even directed a japanese version of macbeth in 1957 entitled, "kumonosu jô." the play starts out with king duncan hearing about the success of two of his generals, macbeth and banquo, in a recent battle with the irish and the norwegians. after a quick promotion from duncan, macbeth instantly gets an uncanny feeling for lust, greed, and power and does everything in his power to gain access to the crown: even if it includes murder.geoffrey wright tried creating his own version of the famous play in 2006 by setting it in the modern melbourne underworld. just imagine a lowly macbeth slaying hundreds of soldiers with an ak-47 and rapping his own rendition of, "low" at the same time. just kidding about the latter, but one thing he does do is utter the traditional shakespeare. and he keeps it going throughout the whole movie. that's right! shakespeare meets ghetto. it's all you could ever hope for! not the newest macbeth is rough and violent enough to match up with any other modern day action film, but it lacks decent acting, the right lingo, and a good technique of camera work.the modernized movie starts out with macbeth (sam worthington) who works as a hit man/drug dealer for duncan (gary sweet), a drug lord from melbourne, australia. after being promoted to the thane of glamis by duncan (as the three witches had predicted), aspiration starts to take over macbeth as he sets his eyes on the throne. after promoting macbeth, duncan invites himself over to macbeth's house for a night of drugs and alcohol. before the festivities begin, lady macbeth (victoria hall) talks macbeth into killing duncan to take power over the throne. after the bodyguards are drunk and everyone's asleep, macbeth sneaks into duncan's room and stabs him to death. after his murder, macbeth takes all of duncan's belongings including hid title and crown. just as soon as he thinks he's got what he wanted, he finds out that it will take more than bribery and running away to solve his problems. one major flaw of the movie was the acting. a once seemingly flamboyant and empowered macbeth suddenly turns into a sissy. and he looks like a sad puppy dog throughout the entire film. i don't really know if this was worthington's or wright's fault, but either way, one of the two should have realized macbeth was a king, not a knot on a log that took everything his wife had to say literally. like i said earlier, macbeth should have been rude, arrogant, and spiteful. but when his character changes over to a drug lord, he changes personalities as well i suppose. on the other hand, lady macbeth really knew how to nip it in the bud when it came to recognizing and personifying her character. she didn't seem quite as spiteful as she was in the play or the 1971 version, but she reminds macbeth that compared to murder, anything else he could possibly do, wouldn't quite match up. another thing i found distasteful was all the nudity. this fluke had to be wright's fault. the witches didn't do a bit of acting, unless you call parading around in your birthday suit acting. at one point in the film, i started to wonder if i was watching macbeth or unique positions vol. 2. don't get me wrong when i say i find the shakespearean dialogue out of place. it's spoken flawlessly, but when it's spoken by an australian gangster, it's just really weird. when macbeth starts to kill people off, he first lets them know by talking to them in ye olde english. macbeth contains plenty of action, blood, gore, and nudity to last anyone a lifetime. you forget all the positive facts though when you start to think to yourself, "okay, what in the heck did he just say in that last sentence?" at some points in the movie, i don't even think the actors themselves knew what they were saying. the new age-ness of the movie could have easily been pulled off it weren't for the, "thou's" and the, "thee's". the camera work was just simply fair for me. one thing i could not stand was the constant pacing back and forth between characters. the camera technique used gave off that blair witch sort of vibe and made me throw up a little in my mouth. matt reeves tried to attempt the same concept of camera work in, clover field but it just doesn't work. it makes me want to get out of my chair and look around for the little barf bags they have conveniently planted on every seat in the airplanes. looking back on it all, the gangsta' macbeth holds one positive: plenty of action. other than that, the movie contains nothing more than uninspired acting, correct english usage, and stomach-turning camera work. the soundtrack holds one or two of the same songs, but each song is edited or remixed differently for every scene. there is never a variation of interesting or captivating media used. from now on out, directors should leave the dangerous drug underworld to al pacino and robert deniro. future renditions of macbeth should be created just as shakespeare intended the play to be 400 years ago. i would recommend using medieval clothing, ye olde english, swords and shields and a soundtrack prepared by enya. but either way, the modern macbeth makes you yearn for some good 'ole folk music, a camp fire, and a bustier.

macbeth is one of the most frequently told stories in cinema and has been translated many times in numerous theater and celluloid settings. originally written by william shakespeare in the early 1600's, macbeth tells the story of betrayal among royalty and one man's quest for power. director geoffrey wright (romper stomper) tries his hand at updating macbeth by setting it in the contemporary melbourne underworld. a film where the characters substitute swords for guns (ala baz luhrman's romeo and juliet) and royal vassals for gangsters, macbeth is a gritty, violent, but critically flawed film.macbeth (sam worthington)works for king duncan (gary sweet). after being elevated to the thane of glamis by the king (as was prophesied to macbeth by three witches), macbeth starts setting his eyes on the throne. one night the king comes to stay at macbeth's house and lady macbeth (victoria hill) talks him into killing the king to assume power. macbeth kills his master and then assumes his crown. but success has it's downside, as macbeth soon finds out, when he has to go to hideous lengths to protect his murderous secret. ok, first things first. the film's major fault is sam worthington. his portrayal of macbeth is in a word... boring. i honestly didn't care about macbeth while watching the film. i had more sympathy for victoria hill's lady macbeth because she bothered to act at least. worthington sits sullen and wood faced throughout the entire film. i felt like he was doing his best impression of johnny deep's george jung character from blow... but without the charisma. i have never seen worthington in a film before so i'm not sure if it was his or the director's fault, but either way the glue that should have tied everything together into one cohesive unit is weak.the dialog is good, but when matched up to the geoffrey wright's australian gangster motif seems a bit out of place. frentically paced action sequences mixed with long shaksperian musings creates pacing conflict within the film. i understand that this is macbeth and that the director wanted to use the original dialog intact. but hard, fast action scenes following a three minute soliloquy tends to get annoying if not a bit pretentious. the camera-work is highly stylized, and for the most part, it works well. one thing that i found annoying was how the camera would slowly jostle back and forth, almost constantly. i don't mind shots like that it's just overdone. it's passes beyond the realm of being cool and stylish and instead becomes irritating. other than that, the art direction and cinematography is fairly well-done. for all of the good qualities macbeth possesses; stylish direction, shakespearian dialog, a strong soundtrack, supernatural nude witches(the weird sisters), and good helpings of brutal, bloody violence. all of these strengths are forgotten when one considers sam worthington's uninspired portrayal of macbeth. the role of macbeth was essential for tying everything together and in this respect geoffrey wright and sam worthington failed miserably, making macbeth a forgettable foray into shakespeare.

the story of macbeth was one of the most successful shakespeare ever wrote. this may be due to some features that place it close to the slasher genre, murder, murder, kill, kill, gallons of blood, a tense sexual relation between the main characters etc. more than this, the original play is very appealing taking into consideration the length (it's only half the size of hamlet) and the focus on macbeth for whom we are constrained to care in spite of his bloody nature. the play would seem ideal to base a movie on. not so lengthy it gives the directors the possibility to explore it's many levels, a good actor can play the role of his lifetime, the film has deep meaning in any historical period. unfortunately this has not been the case with macbeth. polanski's version comes quite close but it insists too much on the medieval period. welles' film is too personal, with an interesting twist towards totalitarianism, the 1990 or so tv version is too shallow. this 2006 movie is no exception. it is very far from a shakespeare film, but it is interesting to see how the director understood the story and where he places it in contemporary life. no knights in shiny armor but gangsters in shiny cars. a lot of drugs and trippy music replace the dread of night in the original play. the idea of macbeth is so simple that to take and implant it in modern day life doesn't need shakespeare at all. the worst part in the film are the lines. most of the poignant scenes of the play, such as the dagger scene are trimmed so much they seem pointless. replacing the knocks in the door with doorbells and horses with cars seems funny. if they wanted to make a movie about power and its temptation they could have done it easily without shakespeare. this macbeth seems to be a looser with a brain injury not a valiant warrior, brave and ambitious that wants power so much he is prepared to to kill and who gets caught up in a net of fears and despair. the movie doesn't make clear what drives lady macbeth to madness, it doesn't give a reason why some of the characters should fear macbeth and his "terror" (since there is no hereditary ascension to the throne, what with no throne and all) and it places macbeth in an awkward position, since the leadership of a gang is as far from kingship as this whole movie is far from any shakespeare. in conclusion, we have two superimposed ideas that never quite meet making this a film that's ultimately pointless.... stand not upon the order of your going but go!

an interesting concept turned into carnage...my first seeing feature from geoffrey wright (romper stomper), when i first took interest in it, it seemed at the time an interesting concept...shakespere + aussie film + gothic setting + melbourne ganglanda very odd mixed that turned into a disastrous piece of aussie cinema that gives my country a bad name...pros: -interesting conceptcons: -waste of a good cast -stuffed and stupid plot -crooked camera angles -not much variety of locations -crap use of shakespearian diologueoverall: australia's worst attempt of a shakespere film, stick to baz lurhman...or romper stomper (warning: that film is dangerous)

a very hyped-up, slick, edgy reinterpretation.they've fallen into the "because it's modern, it has to be hyped-up, slick, etc." trap."romeo and juliet" carried this idea off much more successfully, but i really think it's time we move beyond the two extremes here (period piece vs. edgy film).just because this is a "modern" retelling, doesn't mean the movie has to look like a magazine ad, or have anything to do with drugs or guns.if the trappings were as subtle as the honeyed words, macbeth would be a far more powerful film. as it is, read your shakespeare. read it out loud. ask your oxford dictionary some questions. skip the film. or don't, but you've been warned.sorry for the super-long review. imdb made me do it.

i just caught "farewell to the king" on cable, and maybe it's just because i'm a girl, but i thought this was on the craptastic side. the script and direction are pretentious (once i found out john milius was responsible, it all became clear). the supporting actors actually weren't bad - james fox was outstanding. the biggest disappointment was nick nolte, who i usually enjoy. once he goes native, he starts speaking a very stiff, stilted english, and half the time, he seems kind of distracted, as if he'd just smoked some of the bounty of borneo's rain forest. and then the end -- what the ??? learoyd just happens to be on the same boat as the botanist (by the way, had the botanist dumped the girlfriend, or what?)??? the boat just happens to run aground conveniently close to an island ripe takeover by a crazy anglo ex-headhunting army deserter??

the story of farewell to the king is intriguing. an american "deserter" (i had the impression he and his 3 comrades were only trying to escape capture in the philippines as their desperate escape by raft to borneo is not your classic desertion). but no sooner do they come ashore when they are discovered by the japanese. nolte's character (a sergeant) has only moments earlier walked down the beach alone and was not noticed. and incredibly, no one noticed his footprints in the sand which would have led the japanese right to him. but anyway, nolte is taken in by a tribe of headhunters and becomes their king after defeating another tribesman. so he's out of the war. then the british commandos show up and want the tribe to assist them in fighting the japanese.unfortunately, nolte's incessant hamming ruins an interesting story. instead of acting like a former soldier thrust back into the war, now with a tribe of warriors under his command, nolte acts like he was raised by the tribe. he speaks as if english is almost a foreign language, rarely using contractions. he makes sweeping gestures when he talks, and acts like he is one with nature, as if he was raised in the jungle.there is plenty of action and many interesting scenes with the british interacting with nolte and the tribe. but nolte's character is never believable. it always looks like he's overacting. he needed to be a little more of an american soldier and a lot less of a tribesman. as it is, he comes across, not as a regal king, but as a lunatic who has forgotten who he really is. but that is not the intent of the film, as the script has him being admired and trusted by the british commandos. there is never any suggestion that the british thought his behavior was strange. he is simply viewed by the british as the defacto leader of the tribe. thus, it always seems that nolte's character isn't fitting in with what's supposed to be happening in the film.another actor might have done a great job with the role, delivered his lines believably, and made it an outstanding movie. but nolte ruins the film by hamming up every scene and appearing to not understand what his character is supposed to be.what a waste.

this world war ii film, set in borneo, tries so hard to work on so many levels, it is a shame it fails on all of them.nick nolte is an escaping american who witnesses the executions of his comrades by the japanese. he wanders deep into the jungles of borneo, lost. cue nigel havers, who finds nolte's adopted tribe. nolte, now looking like robert plant, has become his tribe's new king. he defeated a staunch warrior in a bloody battle, and had a telling tattoo on his chest (a dragon). now before you go out and get a painful tattoo and a one-way ticket to borneo, things are not going well in nolteland. havers wants the tribe's help in fighting the japanese, who are invading the island. he teaches the natives how to use machine guns, and a whole lot o shooting begins. as the tribe becomes more successful, they run up against a new squadron of japanese who are not like the others. this squad cannibalizes the villages they conquer in order to keep their strength up (talk about your sushi), and they move through the jungles even quicker than the tribe. since we know the outcome of the war, we know eventually the tribe triumphs, but with heavy casualties. here come the spoilers: havers is injured and returned to "civilization." he gives the location of the kingdom and nolte is captured. havers then goes through the trouble of releasing nolte, and the end credits roll.milius' direction is certainly adequate, but the screenplay here is rather vague in its motivations. it presents story ideas, then abandons them in order to get to the next story idea. nolte is awful as the soldier turned king, desperately trying to channel the spirit of marlon brando's colonel kurtz. he talks about freedom, and the beauty of the jungle, and the richness of his people, and you will not believe for one second the words he utters. he is often unintentionally funny, especially his initial bug out in the jungle, and he spends the rest of the film sounding like a hippie. nigel havers spends the movie looking at nolte like he was raquel welch. the vague homosexual undercurrent between the two goes beyond friendship, not quite to sex, and settles into an unspoken relationship that must have had the natives talking.havers often stands around and has an internal conflict, repulsed at the tribe's headhunting, but basking in nolte's attention. his fellow straight laced british servicemen go native faster than the bounty landing party in tahiti, but all i saw concerning borneo is that it is very humid and has lots of green.the climactic betrayal, where havers gives away nolte's location, is completely devoid of any reason. there is not one thought given as to why havers does this, except to keep the film going. i was angry, when by chance, havers and nolte end up on the same ship going to the philippines, the ship happens to run aground, and havers runs to the hold to free the freshly shorn nolte. no goodbye kiss, but havers says farewell to the king, explaining the title.if you were fighting a war, and an enemy squadron was eating your allies, would that not freak you out? this elite japanese squad is not shown enough, although their eating habits are so horrific i would become a conscientious objector right away. the same type of ghostly enemy was handled much better in "the 13th warrior."other types of interesting ideas are dropped. what about the fact that then modern technology brings about the deaths of so many backward people? why did king nolte let the brits use his subjects without too much hesitation? why can't hollywood find a decent actor to play general douglas macarthur?in the end, "farewell to the king" is a letdown, not anchored by a strong lead, and trying to be too many things without thinking and exploring its options. i cannot recommend this one.this film is rated (pg13) for strong physical violence, strong gun violence, some gore, some profanity, some sexual references, and adult situations.

other than john krasinski, this movie was absolutely terrible. the lacey chabert and andrew keegan love story was as clichéd as possible, full of unbelievably bad lines about how her parents wouldn't ever let them be together and super-hammy longing looks. none of the "emotion" had any depth or reality whatsoever. the two accented-characters (dean edwards as rupert and whoever it was playing the gun expert)....once they saw how bad the accents were, couldn't they have decided to just drop them and rewrite a couple of lines to avoid giving the audience headaches? apparently not. i don't even know where to start with the editing, particularly the sound editing. if you hate obvious over-dubbing as much as i do, don't watch this. that being said, krasinski was great. off the bat i'll admit that i'm a huge office fan and that's why i rented this. but he's quite entertaining as the "off-the-wall friend with crazy ideas". he's got a clichéd role, but he still manages to make it as entertaining as possible. the ending was awful. just flat out terrible. the idea of the robbery gone awry had potential, but keegan floundering around after being shot, all the way to his studio to fall ontop of a painting of chabert (which looks nothing like her) is the most cringe-worthy scene.

i was all in awe of the film looking at the promos and went to watch it fdfs the film was horrible to say the leastthe first scene is good and till they go to london things are funny but slowly the pace slackens and they is nothing funny about itthe manoj joshi subplot is funny at places but is unwanted and adds to the boredomthe drugs part is funny especially the monologue of govindathe film goes on and on aimlessly just like a small kid has written itthe interval brings a twist in the story but by then i lost hopethe second half starts okay but the way things are handled makes a mockery the entire arbaaz- jackie angle is half baked also how come people don't identify them?the climax is quite funny though stupidpriyadarshan is not at all in his elements, from this film he started doing craps and his films got bad and bad music is good, signal, tere bin stand out and afreen too camera-work is goodakshay kumar has white in his stubble and looks old but he acts well though this role he has done many times yet thanks to his natural comedy acting things look bearable govinda looks out of shape, bad and his act except monologue is boring too surprising from govinda seems too much pressure on him to comeback and priyan fails to utilize him paresh is okay in parts but overall just repeat act manoj joshi is funny at places sharat saxena is okay shakti kapoor is great jackie shroff looks overweight and acts in his sleep arbaaz khan is bad lara dutta shrieks to glory but fails to act

i saw this with high expectations. come on, it is akshay kumar, govinda, and paresh rawal, who are all amazing at their comedy, i was really hoping for a laugh riot. sadly, that is not what i got at all...unfortunately, nothing in this movie really made me laugh out loud. there were times when i chuckled at one or two things, but nothing really made me laugh. in short, it was badly attempted comedy, and in a way, a bit of a hera pheri wannabe.out of the three main guys, i think paresh rawal's role was the most powerful. it wasn't the biggest role, but it certainly stood out more than govinda or akshay. their performances were okay i guess. nothing special, just mediocre. though govinda stole the limelight from akshay in more than a few scenes. lara dutta and tanushree dutta also make appearances in this film, and both of them were pretty bad. lara's role did not move me, or make me laugh, and tanushree dutta's character just got on my nerves! the music seems to be the only good thing about bhagam bhag. my favourite song is "tere bin", followed by "afreen", which i really liked. "signal" and the title song "bhagam bhag" are also worth a listen.you either will like it or you won't. and judging by the poor comedy and lack of direction, i don't think you will.

after three hours in the cinema hall,the strongest impression garnered was that their is something amiss. what was clear was that the directors forgot to direct, the actors to act and most importantly the script writer to write. evervbody shouted without reason and made one cringe. the script moved on and on with lots of avoidable twists and turns ending in now, too familiar priyadarshan theory of converging actors at a single point. this theory worked well in hera-pheri and hungama but somehow managed to irritate this time, so did the habit of every actor's incapacity to answer asked of them directly. simplest questions such as " what is your name would be repeated n times".finally what was amiss was that the director forgot that his audience have something called intelligence.

okay, you have:penelope keith as miss herringbone-tweed, b.b.e. (backbone of england.) she's killed off in the first scene - that's right, folks; this show has no backbone!peter o'toole as ol' colonel cricket from the first war and now the emblazered lord of the manor.joanna lumley as the ensweatered lady of the manor, 20 years younger than the colonel and 20 years past her own prime but still glamourous (brit spelling, not mine) enough to have a toy-boy on the side. it's alright, they have col. cricket's full knowledge and consent (they guy even comes 'round for christmas!) still, she's considerate of the colonel enough to have said toy-boy her own age (what a gal!)david mccallum as said toy-boy, equally as pointlessly glamourous as his squeeze. pilcher couldn't come up with any cover for him within the story, so she gave him a hush-hush job at the circus.and finally:susan hampshire as miss polonia teacups, venerable headmistress of the venerable girls' boarding-school, serving tea in her office with a dash of deep, poignant advice for life in the outside world just before graduation. her best bit of advice: "i've only been to nancherrow (the local stately home of england) once. i thought it was very beautiful but, somehow, not part of the real world." well, we can't say they didn't warn us.ah, susan - time was, your character would have been running the whole show. they don't write 'em like that any more. our loss, not yours.so - with a cast and setting like this, you have the re-makings of "brideshead revisited," right?wrong! they took these 1-dimensional supporting roles because they paid so well. after all, acting is one of the oldest temp-jobs there is (you name another!)first warning sign: lots and lots of backlighting. they get around it by shooting outdoors - "hey, it's just the sunlight!"second warning sign: leading lady cries a lot. when not crying, her eyes are moist. that's the law of romance novels: leading lady is "dewy-eyed."henceforth, leading lady shall be known as l.l.third warning sign: l.l. actually has stars in her eyes when she's in love. still, i'll give emily mortimer an award just for having to act with that spotlight in her eyes (i wonder . did they use contacts?)and lastly, fourth warning sign: no on-screen female character is "mrs." she's either "miss" or "lady."when all was said and done, i still couldn't tell you who was pursuing whom and why. i couldn't even tell you what was said and done.to sum up: they all live through world war ii without anything happening to them at all.ok, at the end, l.l. finds she's lost her parents to the japanese prison camps and baby sis comes home catatonic. meanwhile (there's always a "meanwhile,") some young guy l.l. had a crush on (when, i don't know) comes home from some wartime tough spot and is found living on the street by lady of the manor (must be some street if she's going to find him there.) both war casualties are whisked away to recover at nancherrow (somebody has to be "whisked away" somewhere in these romance stories!)great drama.

with knightly and o'tool as the leads, this film had good possibilities, and with mccallum as the bad guy after knightly, maybe some tension. but they threw it all away on silly evening frill and then later on with maudlin war remnants. it was of course totally superficial, beautiful english country and seaside or not.the number one mistake was dumping knightly so early on in the film, when she could easily have played someone a couple of years older, instead of choosing someone ten years older to play the part. they missed all the chances to have great conflict among the cast, and instead stupidly pulled at the easy and low-cost heartstring elements.

quite what the producers of this appalling adaptation were trying to do is impossible to fathom.a group of top quality actors, in the main well cast (with a couple of notable exceptions), who give pretty good performances. penelope keith is perfect as aunt louise and equally good is joanna lumley as diana. all do well with the scripts they were given.so much for the good. the average would include the sets. nancherrow is nothing like the house described in the book, although bizarrely the house they use for the dower house looks remarkably like it. it is clear then that the dower house is far too big. in the later parts, the writers decided to bring the entire story back to the uk, presumably to save money, although with a little imagination i have no doubt they could have recreated ceylon.now to the bad. the screenplay. this is such an appallingly bad adaptation is hard to find words to condemn it. edward does not die in the battle of britain but survives, blinded. he makes a brief appearance then commits suicide - why?? loveday has changed from the young woman totally in love with gus to a sensible farmer's wife who can give up the love her life with barely a tear (less emotional than brief encounter). gus, a man besotted and passionately in love, is prepared to give up his love without complaint. walter (mudge in the book) turns from a shallow unfaithful husband to a devoted family man. jess is made into a psychologically disturbed young woman who won't speak. aunt biddy still has a drink problem but now without any justification. the dower house is occupied by the army for no obvious reason other than a very short scene with jess who has a fear of armed soldiers. whilst miss mortimer's breasts are utterly delightful, i could not see how their display on several occasions moved the plot forward. the delightfully named nettlebed becomes the mundane dobson. the word limit prevents me from continuing the list.there is a sequel (which i lost all interest in watching after this nonsense) and i wonder if the changes were made to create the follow on story. it is difficult to image that rosamunde pilcher would have approved this grotesque perversion of her book; presumably she lost her control when the rights were purchased.

i was shocked to read all these wonderful comments about this movie because i hated it. i stuck it out to the end, but it was painful-- especially having to listen to that voice of the child. as socact-1 remarked, even though the girl claimed to be from chicago, she didn't have a chicago accent-- it sounded more like she was trying to imitate a ny accent--but failed at that as well. i was so confused that i was waiting for the punchline. of all the wonderful actors who could have played that child, why did they select this one? and why force her to talk like that? it wasn't even just the accent, it was the script, the monologue created for her. the reason i even selected this movie was that the plot idea appealed to me-- this era in history, the type of characters that are poor and uneducated, the setting --and the love triangle. as far as i'm concerned it could have and should have been much better. i was just soooo relieved to read that at least one other person felt the same way that i did about this movie.

days of heaven is one of the most painfully boring and pointless films i have ever seen. in no way, shape, or form would i recommend it to anyone...unless you're trying to put your kids to sleep or, god forbid, give someone an aneurysm. if i could go back in time and do one thing, i would set fire to the reels before they were sent to theaters. why? days of heaven's plot is simple, but extremely vague. long sequences devoid of dialogue compose much of the film. the characters are too shallow and ridiculously stupid to relate with. the climax of the story does not touch you: by this time your brain has worked so hard to figure out the plot and the array of hidden metaphors that your ability to think is gone. the only things working are your eyes, and unfortunately, your ears, who must listen to the sound of linda, the little girl in the story, who talks like a man. i am now dumber for seeing this movie. don't let it happen to you.

before i begin, a "little" correction: imdb states that richard gere is 180 cm tall. wrong! i passed by him 10 years ago, and he can't be an ant's a** bigger than 165. i'm 183, and he looked like a child next to me.should have been called "wheatlands"; an appropriate title to complement malick's previous (and much better) movie "badlands". this movie shows that not all directors have as their prime objective to entertain. in fact, some of them have as their main objective to show wheat in all its splendour.the movie is depressing and relatively uninvolving, with the obligatory tragic ending. nothing more than an average and predictable love triangle drama, with the male two-thirds of the triangle not surviving the movie. praised for its visual quality; while it does have that realistic 70s feel to it, there are limits to how spellbinding wheat fields can be. you can shoot them with 1500 mm cameras, for all i care, but they are still wheat fields.gere, who at first seems miscast as some kind of lower-class factory-worker-turned-wheatfield-worker, is quite solid, while brooke adams appears distant and cool for most of the movie, making one wonder just how much she loved either of the two hunks. but for those looking for a movie that displays all the glorious colours of a field of wheat, look no further: you've found your dream!if you're interested in reading my "biographies" of richard gere and other hollywood intellectual heavyweights, contact me by e-mail.

lovely music. beautiful photography, some of scenes are breathtaking and affecting. but the dramatic tension is lost in a film that is so poorly edited it is hard to know what exactly is going on. at times, the dialogue is incomprehensible. then there is richard gere. he's supposed to be a factory worker who gets into trouble and gets work on a farm. we see dozens of farmhands sweaty and dirty in the hot sun. then we see gere, looking like he just wandered away from a calvin klein ad. sam shepard, another glamour guy, is supposed to be terminally ill. but he looks great. nice try, but it just doesn't work. brook adams try hard but she gets lost in the scenery.the real star is the girl.

don't believe the hype!i had to see why all the critics fawn over this movie. i have seen it and still don't get it. the plot is thin, very thin. after the movie was over, i still did not know the female lead characters name and one of the two male characters did not even have a name in the credits, he is credited as "the farmer". i did not care about the characters, so i did not care about the movie.the scenery and cinematography were brilliant, but so is the stuff on national geographic or the discovery channel.i can not recommend this movie to anyone.

now don't get me wrong, i love a good film and after watching the thin red line (and loving it) i was eager to track down terrence malicks two earlier films, and, having just watched days of heaven, my enthusiasm to see badlands has virtually disappeared.i have noted much rave about the beautiful photography, but i saw this film on a terribly old vhs tape which made it look pretty awful. all i can say is i hope the photography was superb, because it would have been one of the only things of interest in this film. not since the replacement killers have i fallen asleep during a film. this film felt so long (and it wasn't!), the editing was choppy and disjointed, the storyline non-existent, the voice over was an incoherent ramble, the characters weakly developed, and the whole thing was uninvolving. i know that malick was uncertain of how to do the film. he consequently shot a heck of a lot of footage then spent around two years editing in an attempt to piece it all together. this is very apparent on screen. everything looks chopped up, every time a scene seemed to gain some momentum (or some character development) it would obtrusively cut to boring scenes of people doing boring things. it was as if someone had tried to cut together a story out of stock footage of people farming. the few good points are the music and the chase scene near the end, but those things are no where near enough to maintain interest. i would normally let a bad film pass by without being too vocal but when it is so highly over-rated something must be said.maybe a farmer would like it...?

i have seen this movie twice, once a few years ago in college, and again this past weekend. although i absolutely despised it the first time, i decided to give it another chance. terrence malick is clearly a well-respected director, and it seems that the imdb viewers, at least, think very highly of the film. but, unfortunately, it seems my tastes haven't changed at all.where to start? for one thing, linda manz's narration is horrific. her voice is so irritating with that horrendous new york accent (please don't try and convince me that chicagoans talk that way - they don't). she herself admitted to just sitting down and talking about random things, which does not make her a talented actress. she's not even acting! i came on imdb expecting to see her ripped apart, since her performance is just so utterly laughable, but people actually seemed to like it! she's simply unappealing in every way - i kept hoping malick would just kill her off.the other actors were fine, but certainly nothing special. adams was probably the strongest in the cast, but she also had the only decent part. except the old guy - he was pretty good.speaking of acting, how could shepard's character be so ridiculously stupid?? he bought the "brother and sister" act because...uh, why would he buy that? bill and abby took every single opportunity to be touchy-feely, as though they didn't realize that their lives depended on acting in a very platonic way. it was just completely unbelievable. and finally, after a considerable amount of time, the farmer suddenly realizes that, "oh my god, they're together!" then he goes after bill with a gun, but instead seems to trip into bill's hand and ends up with a mortal stab wound.speaking of which, the fate of the characters was similarly stupid (and, dare i say, lazy). of course bill has to die - could it be more boring than getting shot in a pond by a pack of cops? abby goes on with her happy life, getting on a train and feeling really content about the way things worked out. and the irksome narrator randomly finds her deadbeat friend and they wander off into the sunset. but it's okay, because malick never gave me any reason to care about the characters anyway.as for the plot, this film drags along endlessly with no real plot twists or development. i can't believe it's only 94 minutes long - i could have sworn i was sitting in my seat for a solid 3 hours. the sudden locust disaster was like throwing the bible in my face; i'm totally fine with metaphors and allusions, but this was completely over the top. clearly the message was, "don't marry for money or bad things will happen to you." very original.i understand that "days of heaven," like all of terrence malick's films, is meant to be a piece of art. and i will certainly agree that the cinematography is simply stunning, and the magic hour shots add a unique aura to the film. but i need more than nice pictures to enjoy a film, and this one just didn't do it for me.

i will admit i didn't pay full attention to everything going on in this film, but to be honest, i don't think it would have mattered. basically local councillor sidney fiddler (sid james) persuades the incompetent mayor frederick bumble (kenneth connor) of firecombe to hold a beauty contest, to improve the town's image. they face opposition from women's liberationist augusta prodworthy (june whitfield) trying to sabotage the contest, but they do have publicity agent peter potter (bernard bresslaw) and palace hotel owner connie philpotts (joan sims). soon enough the young, beautiful wannabe models show up, including hope springs (barbara windsor), paula perkins (valerie leon), dawn brakes (goldfinger's margaret nolan), debra (sally geeson) and ida downs (eastenders' wendy richard). when the girls have cat fights, it does draw away regular residents, but after quite a while of some plodding not that funny innuendos and william (jack douglas) having over-active twitches, it does finally reach the competition, and it's just afterwards i couldn't be bothered. also starring patsy rowlands as mildred bumble, peter butterworth as admiral, joan hickson as mrs. dukes, david lodge as police inspector, angela grant as miss bangor, arnold ridley as councillor pratt, robin askwith as larry, patricia franklin as rosemary, jimmy logan as cecil gaybody and dad's army's bill pertwee as fire brigade chief, charles hawtrey had obviously quit the carry ons, but where's kenneth williams? i suppose seeing babs and young, beautiful looking pauline fowler in bikinis, but for comedy value, this fails miserably, and the overuse of the swanny whistle just gets on your nerves. pretty poor!

this is definitely one of the weaker of the series of carry on films. it lacks the usual fun and sparkle and even the cast seem embarrassed by the poor dialogue. by the time this came out, the series was in terminal decline and boy does it show! if you're coming fresh to this series, avoid this one till near the end.

the opening scene of the beach at fircombe while amusing in itself, unfortunately provides a suitable metaphor for the film - insipid and washed out. it is actually not as corny as most of the others in the carry on series, but maybe because of that doesn't really deliver much fun. it's a fair bet that the title will appeal to fans of the benny hill show but those looking for attractive females in bikinis and miniskirts, while they will see some in this, will probably enjoy some of the other titles in the series, such as "carry on abroad" or "carry on up the jungle" more. the emergence of early 1970s feminism is used as a plot device which seems rather self-defeating.

i consider myself a fan of jess franco and his trash movies, but nearly every time i see one of them, i just see missed opportunities and plots that don't play out well. this film is, unfortunately, no different. the film certainly had a lot of potential, as franco has fused the intriguing theme of the classic film 'the most dangerous game' with his usual brand of trashy sleaze, but the plot here gets lost too often, and it takes an eternity for franco to get round to the main point of the movie. with this being a later franco film, you might be forgiven for thinking that the director would have got better, but actually i've found that the opposite is true; as this and the terrible 'killer barbys' are two of his very worst films. the plot focuses on a stripper and her sleazy boyfriend. the pair is invited to a private island by a rich woman and her lover. however, they soon find that they haven't been invited there for social reasons as they are 'released' on the island so that the wealthy woman and her friends can hunt them down for sport! what attracted me to this film was the front cover and the fact that it was directed by the king of sleaze flicks. you'd think, then, that i'd be pleased that the movie features a plethora of sex scenes and general sleaze; but i'm not. the reason for this is mostly that the sex and sleaze in the film is really boring and most of the time served only in giving me the condition known as 'itchy fast forward finger'. however, my inclination to see everything through to the end ensured that i had to lump it. there was a time when i didn't think girl-on-girl could possibly be boring, but i have since been proved wrong. the only positive i can pluck out the movie really is that the soundtrack is quite catchy, and despite it being silly foreign pop music; actually blends quite well with the sex scenes. i did enjoy the last ten minutes; as that's when the plot finally got going, but it was a case of too little too late and unfortunately, this is a severely lacklustre film. on the whole, i only recommend this film to those who feel they must see all 180+ franco movies...everyone else should watch vampyros lesbos, faceless or she killed in ecstasy instead.

i know jesse franco is responsible for a wide variety of films, and i mainly go for his horror films, as lousy as they are at times. i guess it was morbid curiousity that drew me to this, and i wasn't even curious enough to finish it. maybe it got better towards the end but unless you're into lesbian sex scenes (of which there's plenty) then you may want to take a pass. so what exactly can you say about a movie that features a woman that pees in a bowl on the kitchen counter (while standing up)? just never you mind what that's used for later, you probably don't want to know. if this sounds intriguing to you, then that's your problem but then again you might just like this movie. i myself, am no prude, i've seen plenty of disgusting movies in my day but at least they were done well, and this isn't. sometimes too much is just too much. bleah.

when i started watching this, i instantly noticed that i couldn't understand what anyone was saying. i turned up the volume. with background noises now booming out, i could hear the voices. just what are the actors saying? is the movie not dubbed? are they speaking spanish? after some confusion, i realize that it was english. at least, i think so... the amazing jess franco has placed the microphones too far away from the actors. as a result, we cannot completely hear what they are saying. he's done this before. but maybe this is mr. franco's intention? by not knowing what people are saying, we are thrown into some mystery about what is going on, and are left with more visual clues... maybe it's just me, but i would have liked to know what was going on! how about a few hints? the basic premise (i refuse to call it a "plot") concerns a young american exotic dancer named paula (played by amber newman) who has a boyfriend who gets her invited to a small island owned by some sleazy rich people. it is somewhere off the coast of spain. for this visit, a large cash payment is promised to paula, which the boyfriend gets. he then escapes from the island, only to return later. why? pay close attention to the scene where the boyfriend opens paula's us passport. though his hand tried to cover it up, you can see the actress' real name, amber newman, printed below the photo on the bottom of the passport!! anyway, back to the "story": there are some other sleazy, rich, beautiful characters visiting the island, all with ambiguous motives. we witness sadistic games (are they real or fake?) and unappealing dining scenes. but the food must be good, as a phony french chef prepared it! there is a young woman servant who runs around naked and never speaks. is she really mute? and do we care? of course all the women are mostly naked throughout this film... oh well, we can at least be thankful that the (50+ and overweight) men remain clothed! in addition to the abysmal sound quality, what i have always marveled at about jess franco is his amazing ability to film beautiful naked women in such a way that leaves the viewer completely turned off. this film is no exception  i needed fresh air after watching it! in conclusion: i am happy to report that regardless of what mr. franco can dream up, i am still attracted to women.

don't be fooled by the other reviewers. although this film contains an impressive array of talent, the material they present leaves a great deal to be desired. nat king cole's 3 numbers are pretty lame and not even close to his later efforts, though he does impress with his piano playing. 'moms' mabley is not a bit funny, though i remember her as a very entertaining talk show guest from my youth. actually, the best performances are from a couple of fat guys who impress with a lively tap dance and a four tops takeoff, and the jazz band itself, especially in the number featuring the bass player. the print itself is pretty poor quality, and the wonderful butterfly mcqueen is totally wasted in the wraparound plot.

wow, umm this was a very, how to say it, different type of movie. it calls itself a comedy...but it wasnt really laught out loud funny at all. it was insane. if you are willing to accept that 3 people survive a calamity of a global scale, why not 4? or 5?.....and why did it suddenly end without anything happening??? they could have made this much better by simply having another element in the plot such as a dumpy female for the ugly dude or something.......zinc, riduculous....ahhi dunno..watch it...it wasnt that bad.....sorta funny at times....i guess...schneider

the only reason i rented the movie was to see jeri ryan in it! omg that was the most boring, pointless movie i've ever seen!!! how lame!!! i mean really, give me a break! after voyager, i'd hope she'd be offered better roles!!if i were one of the last people on earth, i would not still be living in a travel trailer in the dessert!! this is just such a bad movie!! the thing about the indian tribe and how he compared it every 10 seconds really, really got old. poor jeri, better luck next time!

after wasting 2 hours of my life watching this movie on late night television, i went back and reread some of the imdb material, to remind myself of why i watched it in the first place. in hindsight, the only thing that i can think of is that the genre generally appeals to me. but this movie was a total waste of effort. it fails on every level, and to see that it's described on imdb as a comedy really leaves me at a loss. i don't recall more than a couple of chuckles. there are more laughs in any episode of law and order than in the last man. seriously.too much of the characters' interaction just didn't seem to me to have any foundation, and was therefore very unlikely/unbelievable.if it hadn't been for the almost-gratuitous bikini shots, well, what can i say? avoid this movie like the plague. or tape it and just fast forward to the bikini shots. do not spend even $1 to rent it though.

hypothetical situations abound, one-time director harry ralston gives us the ultimate post-apocalyptic glimpse with the world dead, left in the streets, in the stores, and throughout the landscape, sans in the middle of a forgotten desert. one lone survivor, attempting to rekindle his sanity, takes food from the city to his bungalow in this desert. all alone, he hopes for more, but with nobody around, he is left with white underwear, and a passion for a local indian tribe  until the discovery of a camera which opens up new doors and breaks the barriers of human co-existence. alan, a man of the book, is left on earth after an unknown disaster. thinking he is alone, he begins living life his way  until, jeri ryan, appears (like she would in any dream) out of the woods, disheveled, and unhappy to find the final man alive to be ... well ... like alan. anyway, they try to co-exist, fail, get drunk, and before creating the ultimate dystopia, they run into redneck raphael (played by newcomer  dan montgomery jr). bonds are torn, confusion sets in, a couple becomes a third wheel, and the battle between physically inept nerd vs. brainless jock. even with nobody left on the planet, it becomes a truth that even the darkest of human nature will arise.using a variable film technique, ralston gives us a mediocre story based loosely on another film entitled "the quiet earth" (which i will be viewing next) oddly which he never gives any credit towards. with a borrowed story, i guess he does a decent job of reinterpreting it. his punch seems to be lacking at the beginning while ralston tries to find his stride, borrowing yet again from other film director's techniques to attempt to find his own. he opens the film interestingly enough, but fails to answer any direct answers. sure, the final days have arrived, but could there be a concise answer as to "how" or better yet "why" these select few survived. a spookier beginning would have led us stronger into a comical film. the juxtaposition would have been like "shawn of the dead", but instead left us feeling like we were watching a "made-for-tv" program. listening to the audio commentary, i have respect for ralston because he worked diligently to get this film made, and his passion nearly sells the film, but you could tell from his interaction with the cast that he wasn't as happy with his overall final product. there were mistakes, ones that he pointed out and others that he was ashamed to point out. while this does make for decent independent film-making, it sometimes feels cheap, and in ralston's case, it was the latter.i must admit, david arnott's portrayal of alan hooked me. he played that wimpy, school nerd, adult role very well. he was funny to both watch and listen to, and thus he became sympathetic to the viewer. he was a key player in keeping the film together, alas, i cannot say the same for the rest. this was dan montgomery's first film, and it was obvious  i mean  really really obvious. there were scenes in which i thought the cue card was about to come out and read the lines for him, perhaps even giving us a more realistic performance, but alas, it wasn't the case. then there was jeri ryan. she pulled into her character near the end of the film, which to me, was the culmination of the entire piece of art. she goes from estranged unknown to bitter cranky insane girlfriend by the end. confused? again, she fell into her character by the end, giving us just a glimpse of what she could have probably done as her acting matured. even as the commentary progressed, all that she contributed was a laugh, giggle, or "ohhh, look at that color" moment. while her beauty may sell tickets, one may want to consider knowledge to be just as beautiful. this was her first film, so can i be too harsh? overall, this film felt like it was missing something. i though the idea was strong  the premise that even with only a peppering of people remaining on the earth the evil of human nature still exists. jealousy cannot be killed by bacteria or bombs (maybe because it is consumed by zinc?) and we as a race will always want what we cannot have. ralston is not a surprising director, his techniques are flawed and pre-used, but he does know how to make a low-budget comedy. i think our idea of "funny" is different, so that is why i couldn't find myself laughing at many of the bits he found "hysterical". his actors provided the level of acting needed for this film, which was lower than average. his film was loose, meaning that there were elements never quite explained or tackled (i.e. anything with wings survived?!?), which overall harmed the intensity of the film. this was a comedy, but it could have been much darker and much much funnier. for those thinking that roger avery was a huge element to this film, as we learn from their commentary, all he was there for was money  the was in essence, the bank for "the last man". don't get your hopes up for any classic avery moments.don't expect more from ralston  and that is how i will end it.grade: ** out of *****

i saw this movie in part because of some positive comments here on imdb. after wishing i had those 90 minutes of my life back, i feel it's my duty to get on here myself and say...please don't bother watching this movie.i can't argue with the actors efforts - they did what they could given the material, but that material is dreadful. the pace was deadly - slow, meandering, and you saw everything coming about an hour away, and then it took forever to happen. the dialogue was boring, pointless, not funny at all. the characters were all completely unsympathetic. and the cinematography was, in my opinion, very low quality - the cliché of "character uses home video machine!" was used to very bad effect.yes, jeri ryan is a cool person. don't let that sucker you into wasting your time on this film.

how do stories this bad get made. that's not a question. it is a statement.here are my problems with the film.1) much of the story development was predictable and boring. my emotions ran pretty much in a flat line throughout. there wasn't really much to draw the viewer into the film.2) the characters were decidedly uncharismatic. one was a loon, another was confusing, and the third was pretty damned boring. there was absolutely zero reason to be drawn to these people. even though i knew it wouldn't happen, i kept hoping that they would run into someone else, someone more interesting.3) the physical environment was uncomfortable for me. a trailer??? in the desert??? the desert is a place that most people would prefer not to visit. how is it that these three people end up in the desert???4) and in the same desert. did the writer really expect me to believe that the last three people on earth would manage to find each other within the span of a few weeks out in that desert?5) was it really necessary for ms. ryan to be in two scenes that required a swimsuit? hey, she looks great, but it was pretty gratuitous.okay, so if i thought it was so bad, why did i give it a 3? i am trying to be as objective as possible. even though i found alan annoying, i have to say that david arnott did a very credible job of portraying a neurotic nerd (the character reminded me of a few of albert brooks more annoying roles). jeri ryan tried to do something with sarah, but it just wasn't written very well. okay, so she was supposed to be a confused, dysfunctional woman. but why? what did it add to the story? her mood swings left me feeling like i was being jerked (hard!) one way and then another and then another.i don't often walk out on films, but this one had me contemplating it several times. stiff, predictable, boring. proceed at your own risk.my 2 cents.

about five years ago, my friend and i went to the video rental store to get something to watch. my friend saw space truckers on the shelf, and so we got it. once we got home and started watching it, we realized what an absolute piece of crap it was! a beer can floating in space? a guy taking a dump in a toilet? a guy with a mechanical dick who tries to arouse a women by saying, "whizz, whizz!"? wtf!!! the dumbest, stupidest, most retarded, horribly throne together piece of trash my eyes have ever been exposed to. my friend and i still refer to it as the worst movie we have ever seen. only one other movie has come close to its crappiness (and that would be the stupid jackie chan flick, "the medalion"). if you eyes ever see this piece of junk on the shelf at your video store, proceed to do the following: 1. take it off the shelf and throw it to the ground. 2. stomp on it for at least 30 seconds. 3. proceed to set it on fire in a contained facility (bathroom stall). 4. lastly, take it to your local hazardous waste management facility immediately so that it may be properly dealt with.stay away from "space truckers"!!!!!!!!

if you're one of those people who doesn't really like sci-fi because of their sometimes far-fetched ideas and surreal world perspectives, you better stay away as far as you can from stuart gordon's space truckers! it truly is an absurd space adventure, stuffed with eccentric characters, colorful kitsch and ludicrous plot-twists. in all honestyi probably never would have cared for this film, if it wasn't for gordon's name on the credits. this guy comes pretty close to being a genius in the horror genre, with undeniable milestones like from beyond' and re-animator' on his résumé. apparently, stuart gordon likes his humor as twisted as possible! he already went completely over the comedy-top once (with re-animator) but, with the slight difference that the bizarre humor was effective there. something that isn't really the case for space truckersmost of the gags lead nowhere and the entirely exaggerated atmosphere only works in small doses. in the end, all that remains is an occasionally amusing but completely unnecessary mess. dennis hopper and charles dance (or at least a semi charles dance) are always a joy to look at and the still stunning barbara crampton has a small role near the end of the film. crampton was stuart gordon's regular heroine in previous horror films. the story of space truckers is as silly as they come. dennis hopper plays the self-made loner who's fed up with his job. who wouldn't be when you're transporting pigs across the galaxy for a company named interpork? he sees his change to flee while bringing his muse to earth. they float into space-pirates and find out their cargo is meant to wipe out half the universe! stuart gordon wisely returned to making horror again after this little escapade. since space truckers, he already made the sublime `king of the ants' and the absolutely brilliant `dagon'

k, one day my father picked up a movie with a 'neat' cover. got home with my mom and we were like yay lets watch this new movie we never saw before! .. ok so it started ... interesting start, cool robots and disgusting gore (eek) on a strange planet (actually it was pluto wasn't it?)... blablabla i could tell the whole story but i rather not point, wtf never ever pick up a movie with a lame ass name, and seriously don't ever i mean ever judge a book by its cover (err tape..) it looked like an interesting movie however it was a slap to the face for sci-fi movies, its disgusting. i mean it was so bad i just started laughing (i swear it tryed to be serious) i cant describe the stupidity! it killed more then a million brain cells of mine i can't even write a descent critique. its that bad! argh and i wana prepare you for something "strange' *cough cough* mechanical p3n1$ *cough cough* sorry just had to say it, its so funny, think of it as a commedy or a parody of sorts for sci-fi movies. its classic batman laughs but in a new packaging. what the hell was this director thinking?

there is only one word that describes this film: bad!! i have no idea why this movie was even made, or how they got dennis hopper to star in this film. stuart gordon is a better director than this and hopper is a much better actor. the film is plain stupid. i did like the "square pigs" idea and there was an interesting love scene involving a cyborg, other than that, avoid this film at all costs.

...in a tv-movie 70's kind of way. it's one of those movies that show up in the wee hours, but rarely because more modern late-hour schlock movies bump it off. it has likeable performances by graves and wynn. generally, it's just a harmless little piece of nothing that doesn't offend too badly. nothing good, a lot that's mediocre.

this film is a mediocre, low-budget flick. i've seen much worse on mst3k, let me assure you, but this is still a pretty crappy film.the film is about clonus, a top-secret government facility in which clones are used to give organs to politicians. it's an almost orwellian society, actually: almost (but not quite) effective.the film starts to roll downhill when the head clone (tim connely of `emergency' fame) falls in love with a female clone (paulette breen, who appeared in this and at most four other films {and this was not her first film}). they begin to suspect something. after finding a beer can in the nearby river, the plot starts to unravel. the clone receives no answers from either the head scientist (dick sargent from `bewitched') or the `confessional', a computer which supposedly knows everything, so he breaks into the main clonus building and (in a scene hilariously destroyed by mike and the bots) finds out the truth (including a clone video which, eerily, shows the exact same method that was used to clone dolly five years ago . .. and this film was made over twenty years ago . . .) about clonus. he breaks free, pursued by two guards. he has one hell of a time breaking through the two-foot high fences, though he has a considerably harder time climbing up some boulders. from there it continues to slide. also appearing are peter graves (`beginning of the end', `it conquered the world') as the presidential candidate and keenan wynn (`dr. strangelove', `piranha', `once upon a time in the west') and lurleen tuttle (`ma barker's killer brood', `psycho') as the elderly couple who help clony after he escapes.the mst3k version was priceless; one of the best episodes ever.four stars for the film;10 for the mst3k version.

the movie was actually not that bad, especially plot-wise, but the doughy (and hairy!) actor they chose for the leading role was a little chintzy in the acting department. i would have chosen someone else. the idea of "going to america" was very ingenious, and the main character questioning everything that he'd ever known made him somewhat likable, but not very much so when there's a pasty blob for a leading actor.the storyline was interesting. it brings about the question of how the subject of cloning will be handled in the future. certainly cloning wouldn't be allowed for the purposes in the movie, but it's still a valid argument even for today. clones are still people... right?the movie wasn't particularly special, but it still is a lot better than some of the cheese released during the 70s. let us not forget the "giant spider invasion." i give it a 4, since it didn't totally stink, but the mst3k version makes this movie a 10. (i still like dr. super mario!) you'll like this movie, but it won't be your favorite.

i have never seen this movie on its own, but like many others who have already commented, i saw it as an episode of mst3k. really terrible 70s television schlock. but someone saw its potential because it's just been turned into a $125 million flop called the island.and to the person who asked whether there were any good movies made in the 70s, i want to remind her that it was a golden age for american film with directors like robert altman and martin scorcese first coming into their own. not to mention little things like star wars (1977). just a reminder that the 70s were far more creative than the 21st century has been so far.

i have now suffered through parts, the clonus horror.to have the word horror in the title of this movie is an insult to real horror.the story was about a cloning-central owned by the "the man" they grow clones for harvesting organs from the clones later on for the original humans in need of transplants. one clone escapes, the government gets angry and kills all involved, but the story somehow leaks out anyway.it is truly shameful how a movie with potential is destroyed by amateurs such as fiveson. the only thing he genuinely succeeded in doing was to weave in the concept of human rights and the very philosophical aspect, what makes a human a human, and would it be ok to grow clones for organic harvesting? sadly, mediocre actors have been chosen and the plot has left town, until the very end in where a pathetic attempt is made to sum it up.but!! what disturbed me the most was the introducing of new characters lacking actual relevance for the plot. despite that, fiveson feels the need to kill them off in a bad explosion which only sir coleman francis himself would be proud of.the setting was interesting. how fiveson thought that pulling out sheets of plastic and running water over them would make a believable river is beyond me, but i guess if you were to compare the setting to coleman francis' gray pasty oatmeal of a setting, this film would win.perhaps coleman has changed what bad movies are for me. 3/10

the premise of this film is the only thing worthwhile. it is very poorly made but the idea was clever, if not entirely original. it's a shame the other aspects of the film weren't better. the acting is especially bad.

like most other people, i saw this movie on "mystery science theater 3000." although it received some well-deserved barbs, it's one of the better films to be featured on that show.the premise is better than even your average hollywood blockbuster these days; it poses some interesting moral dilemmas. although the score is sometimes obtrusive, it also provides a few lovely moments when richard is walking by the river. watching the movie, you can see where a lot of plot developments probably looked very good on paper. richard's discomfort in modern society is an interesting problem to ponder, and the ending probably would have been a nice '70s-style mindfuck if the preceding affairs hadn't been so goofy.unfortunately, the movie is visibly cheap, making the flaws all the more obvious. the "clone farm" is very obviously a college campus, and a beer can serves as a major plot point. lena and richard have zero chemistry -- we are supposed to believe this is a meeting of kindred minds, but there doesn't seem to be a brain cell between them. the "cranky old couple" schtick also gets real old, real fast. there are also some mistakes that can be blamed on bad directorial choices, such as the decision to hold a climactic conversation out of reach of any audio equipment whatsoever.in all, a noble effort, but is nonetheless best viewed on mst3k.

this movie starts out great, and sucks you in. most acting is good until patrick swayze (with his texas twang- everyone else sounds british-like even the muslim) shows up, and proves that he can't act. you can live with that until the first fight scene where all they all fall to pieces. why does patrick swayze fight baddies with an ax when he just stuck his sword into the ground 5 minutes ago.there's further misplacing of swords a few minutes later, and people knowing about other people they shouldn't know about. other reviewers mentioned "troubled production" and it shows.at the end i just didn't even care about the fight scenes, sure, the cgi dragon was weak, but the storyline was the biggest letdown.

i saw this on the sci-fi channel so i knew it would be bad to start with but i was surprised at how much worse it was than expected. the cg effects on the dragon were terrible, even for the sci-fi channel and the writing was pathetic. i couldn't tell if this was supposed to be that stupid as a joke or if it just came out that way. the only redeeming quality of this movie is that it's so terrible it's almost funny, especially the part where patrick swayze's knight character goes home to his knight father who has retired after losing his legs and is now bed-ridden in his armor for the sole purpose of letting the audience know he was a knight. the majority of the movie focuses around an enormous dragon egg that hatches into a not-so-enormous baby dragon with some of the worst cgi i've ever seen. this was just awful.

their purple moment aspect ratio: 1.33:1sound format: silent(black and white - short film)two luckless nightclub revellers (laurel and hardy) are unable to pay their bill, provoking violent retribution from a hot-tempered waiter (tiny sandford).typical l&h scenario, less substantial than some of their best work from this period, but worth a look nonetheless. stan takes center-stage this time round, caught up in a financial dilemma after holding back part of his wages to fund a night on the town, only to find out - too late! - that his aggrieved wife (fay holderness) has replaced his stash with worthless coupons. some of the prolonged closeups of laurel as he slowly becomes aware of the unfolding disaster reveal his genius for characterization and mime. 1920's morality is represented by patsy o'byrne, playing a hatchet-faced busy-body who takes great joy in alerting l&h's respective spouses (holderness and lyle taho) to their husbands' bad behavior. the ending fizzles, but the movie still has much to recommend it. directed by james parrott.

i had a very hard time sitting through this film. unless you really are very pro-adultery and like to hear people endlessly talking about their sexual exploits, i can't see how you could enjoy this film. geez--most of the main characters behaved like rutting weasels and their bragging about their many infidelities grew tiresome. about the only element of this i appreciated was the disgusting scene where the one character was urinating and blood was splattering everywhere because he'd picked up an std---big surprise!?! hmm.if you want a good film, watch the sequel, barbarian invasions. despite the general unlikable nature of many of the characters, the sequel is very involving and more realistic--well worth your time.

sex is a most noteworthy aspect of existence. it is perhaps the most interesting activity there is between birth and death. le declin de l'empire americain studies human sexuality in a dry and boring manner. actually, worse than being simply boring, seeing nude 40-year-olds is, well, unpleasant.i guess there is some shock value in having adults as old as our parents talk about sex, but after twenty minutes, this stops being interesting. perhaps if the characters were all 20 years younger, the film would be more visually captivating.le declin de l'empire americain is not worth the time.

for the uninitiated, almost any andy milligan film is a shock, but despite the fact that i've seen many of his films, this one still takes the cake for sheer shoddiness.this is, of course, milligan's take on the sweeney todd tale, done with period costumes (but not necessarily period hairstyles, in some cases) and the usual headache-inducing camera-work & grainy quality. as for the gore, well, the version i saw may have been cut some, for there's not a lot, for a film with "bloodthirsty" in the title. the best indication of subversive film-making here is a meat pie consisting only of some poor victim's tit.so, while i will still treasure this piece of, uh, work, on my video shelf, it's definitely somewhat of a letdown as far as content though. recommended for only the foolhardy & morbidly curious. 3 out of 10.

what a terrible movie this was! i made it about 50 minutes into it and started skipping chapters until the end. the plot is nothing special, and the dialog from the movie deviates from the main story so much that your head will explode out of rage. many useless minutes wasted just listening to characters jabber on about something irrelevant to the plot, and/or something that could said in a shorter amount of time. the camera work is shaky, and grainy. it seemed mr. milligan needed to take his finger off of the zoom button! i noticed also that at some points during this movie it seemed that andy was having seizures, and would uncontrollably shake the camera. the splices between scenes were jumpy and didn't flow. the murder scenes were nothing special - incredibly, and laughably fake. barely any gore, as the title suggests. this movie runs about 1 hour 20 minutes and the murder scenes take up about 1 minute total of the whole movie - if that. what a wretched piece of garbage this movie was. andy milligan is in fact probably one of the worst directors to plague mankind with his talentless directing, and camera-work. usually, i can make it through really bad horror movies, and laugh about it later. bloodthirsty butchers, however, i can't. i am just angry i wasted an hour and a half of my life watching this (what i wouldn't do to gain it back). take my suggestion, and do not see this movie unless you plan on falling asleep. terrible.

hip, distinguished doctor james coburn (as peter carey) arrives to accept a position as pathologist at a boston hospital. almost immediately, mr. coburn beds beautiful nutritionist jennifer o'neill (as georgia hightower). while sleeping with ms. o'neill, coburn is awakened by an emergency involving a botched abortion - the fifteen-year-old who bleeds to death happens to be the daughter of the hospital's big donor, dan o'herlihy (as j.d. randall). coburn doesn't believe the man arrested, doctor pal james hong (as david tao), committed the crime; although, mr. hong admits to performing illegal abortions on the side. while trying to clear his friend, coburn wades through a thickening plot **** the carey treatment (3/29/72) blake edwards ~ james coburn, jennifer o'neill, michael blodgett, james hong

i read about this film on-line and after seeing the generally positive reviews it has received, and viewing the trailer, i decided to check it out for myself. what a disappointment! it starts out well enough. the opening scene was actually pretty tense, but from there it's all downhill. i can see that the filmmakers were trying to do something different with this movie, but by doing so, they took all the enjoyment out of watching it. those choices combined with the "c.s.i" editing, use of music and montage, lack of suspense, scares, or humor really drag this film down. there's too much foreshadowing and to many "subtle" clues, so when the first twist arrives early on, you already know how the movie is going to end. i gave the movie three stars because i think the cast did a good job, other than that i can't recommend this movie.

i was only cautiously enthusiast when renting "all the boys love mandy lane", as i instantly remembered hearing & reading a wide variety of opinions  both positive and negative  in the short period of time between its brief cinematic release and the distribution towards videostore shelves. supposedly this was the most ingenious and refreshing new horror film in years, with non-stereotypical teen characters and unpredictable plot twists for a change. okay, the basic concept may perhaps sound reasonably innovative but inevitably the screenplay quickly reverts to the same old and irritating slasher clichés, and once passed that point even the nifty stylistic trademarks can't save the film from dreadful mediocrity. the opening sequences are indeed terrific and literally bath in a moodily melancholic ambiance, which actually makes it all the more painful to witness the film sink towards the "ordinary" level of rudimentary slasher flick. after the sublime intro, showcasing a drunk macho kid miscalculate his jump off a rooftop in order to impress the titular beauty, "all the boys love mandy lane" turns out to be just another textbook and uninspired horror movie about a bunch of idiotic kids getting stoned and horny on a secluded ranch before getting killed off by a not-so-unidentified maniac. the film's entire pretentious set-up collapses faster than a ramshackle house of cards: we never get a proper explanation why mandy herself behaves so frigid and haughty towards all her admirers (because she grew up an orphan, perhaps? oh, boo-hoo), the boys soon enough illustrate they'd settle for sex with any random bimbo and not exclusively with the "divine" mandy and the final twist  albeit undeniably offbeat  is just plain senseless. the middle section of is rather boring and doesn't even offer any genuinely horrific excitement (shotgun killings? please!) or authentic rancid sleaze. my generous rating 4 out of 10 entirely goes to the grainy and unsettling 70's filming style (with faded colors, bizarre but beautiful photographic images) and the surprisingly marvelous soundtrack. director jonathan levine opted for the classic bobby vinton song "sealed with a kiss" to play during the trailer and end-credits, whereas i initially was convinced the film would inevitably feature barry manilow's cheesy love-song "mandy".

all the boys seem to be sexually aroused by mandy lane. all the girls seem to be jealous of mandy lane. but, nothing seems to become of it, and this viewer wonders why? mandy is beautiful and a magnet to every boy she meets, but we never get to know mandy or any of the characters in the film. mandy accepts an invitation, from her student friends, to go to a secluded ranch. three boys and three girls drink and drug. in the film, the teenagers drink booze like its water, and take drugs to experience a psychedelic trip. and, there is absolutely no sex. in the meantime, the teenagers disappear one by one. but, the others are all drunk and high. nobody, including those watching the film, cares or is at all concerned. nobody, including the audience, seems to give a damn. emmet, a fellow student, is the instigator of the entire event. there is a security guard, garth (dashingly and handsomely played by anson mount), who guards and protects the ranch. midway through the film, the killer is revealed, the tension is suddenly released like air let out of a balloon. the events are completely predictable, and the film just completely fizzles out. mandy meets her match, but we don't ever know why--and, at the end of the film, there is still no sex. does mandy hypnotize the boys, or does she simply bore all of the boys and girls to their deaths? this absolutely-confused viewer can only conclude that mandy wishes to get rid of the female and male competition--by killing off the manipulative girls and the nasty boys.is mandy worth all of the attention? the director (jonathan levine) seems to think so, but this viewer does not. the able cinematographer (darren genet) provides some stunning images but, in fact, his focus seems to be on garth, who is quite the stud. not all of the boys love mandy, or do they? if you want to be bored enough to find out how this film winds up, my advice is to sleep midway through film, until you see the temptress mandy and garth's bulging crotch. but, don't wait for anything to happen. yep, you guessed it. mandy remains a virgin, and there's still no sex. i rank this film a 3 out of 10, but not because of mandy. why? because all of the girls love garth, and all voyeuristic eyes seem to be on garth in a compromising position. but unfortunately, girls and boys, this film never seems to get beyond a disappointing and incomplete sexual fantasy. mandy goes to a secluded ranch, and nothing sexual ever happens. the audience is led to horror on a ranch--and cannot help, but wonder why?

how could this get a 6.0 rating? are we as horror fans so used to horror films being so utterly bad these days, that when one comes along that has some, and i repeat 'only some', redeeming quality's, we get much too excited and give a rating that is just a wee bit too high? the director has a certain visual flair. no doubt about that. but in between some decent shots he forgot a good story, mood or scares. it had a very slow first act, lazy killing scene's, annoying and flat characters and a very stupid and very unbelievable twist. and what's with the portrayal of american teenagers in so many of these kinds of films? do they always have to be this stupid, irritating and so godd#mn superficial. i don't remember teens being like this when i grew up here in holland. all things considered, in can't give this film anything more that a 4 out of 10 rating.

this game was terrible. i think they worked too hard on the visuals and didn't do much with the gameplay, which is the most important part. i mean, the visuals look incredible, but is the game really "fun"? no! i mean it's like "hey let's jump off buildings" and all i'm doing is holding up and a/x. the game play just isn't there, and i don't agree with what ubisoft did, because they had this hot girl (the producer of the game, jade raymond), and they were like "ok we've got this hot girl, let's pimp her" and if you go to gaming websites, you're not gonna see gameplay stuff of assassin's creed, you'll see her face with a microphone and it'll be like "we interviewed jade raymond about her favorite cookies!" it's like man, shut the f*@k up who cares?! apparently...a lot of people do, because they bought the game and like it...i mean compare this game with super mario galaxy. a wii game that really doesn't abuse the wii remote, but still is very innovative and delivers in the most important part, gameplay! they were able to do a bit of everything with mario galaxy, the graphics were still stunning, the music in the game was orchestrated and sounded amazing, and that's a game that deserves game of the year. not assassin's creed, man, it doesn't even deserve to even be a nominee for game of the year. the hype around this game where it was like "oh it's the next generation of gaming"....really? i think not! so let me get this straight here, because i think the people liking this game are only liking it because they're jade fans, so i'll tell you guys, jade will not make out with you or anything if you love or defend this game! if you want a real game on the ps3, get uncharted: drake's fortune, if you want a real game for the xbox 360, get call of duty 4 (and a ton of other games too), and if you want a real game just in all the systems? get super mario galaxy! i know this comment will be hated by many, but seriously, pressing two buttons for doing all this cool stuff, is that really a fun game? the only reason why other games make it more complicated is because after it'll end up being more innovative and fun. and this game just isn't it.1.3/10 a living hell!

this is hands down the most annoying and frustrating game i have ever encountered. every time you turn around the game takes control of your character or creates invisible walls that you can't walk through. the cut scenes leave you in control of your character's movements, but only to a slight degree. also, you have to play the game for about 2 hours just to get past the intro/tutorials. it's terrible! i am afraid if i play this game any more i will end up breaking something. this game sucks. the graphics are good, but nothing special, the game play, however, is awful. to say i hate this game would be a huge understatement. i got it on sale, but i want my $20 back. what a waste!

it's 2 stars only because they put a lot of work in making this game look good. i played plenty of good and bad games and i think this game has the dullest story i was ever forced to listen. the best thing they could have done is to let you skip the conversations (but no, you must listen to them talking for 10 minutes) and just continue doing the same things over and over again. climb the building, save the citizen, go kill some dude. it's all the same! ubisoft should really hire someone with some imagination.i'm a huge fan of prince of persia series (first 3). the story was good and you wanted to know what happens next all the time. i don't even hate prince of persia 4. but i think anyone who was in charge of developing the story for assassin's creed should be banned to write another thing for the rest of his life.boring story and same missions over and over again! if just one of these two things was good the game would be worth playing.

the comments already left for this show are way more funny than the show itself and they are all accurate. i feel exactly the same way, that i am very disappointed at how far rick mercer has fallen when he used to do some really great things on this hour has 22 minutes but now he is just clowning around, going places and talking to people. he does some bits in the studio about things going on in the news but they are never funny at all, just really sad and predictable jokes about headlines. most of his show is him going somewhere to talk to people, for example this week he is going to a rodeo and the video pieces are all of him making funny faces and acting scared of the wild horses, etc. he used to be funny but has gotten way less funny since leaving this hour has 22 minutes and that show is also not funny at all any more. now that air farce is off the air (finally thank goodness!) mercer and this hour has 22 minutes have got to be next in line for the axe, just old tired predictable comedy that almost nobody finds funny any more. it's sad really considering rick mercer used to be the funniest man on canadian tv!

remember when rick mercer was funny? 22 minutes was a great show when rick mercer was on it and made in canada was a great show once too. talking to americans was such a funny special too. but like my friend said "rick mercer woke up one day and wasn't funny any more" i think that day was when rick mercer report went on the air. what is the point of this show? rick mercer reads wacky fake headlines, shows pictures of bad sheds that people mail in and then spends about 20 minutes of the 30 minute show going somewhere and just talking to people hoping to say something witty or clever enough to get on tv and maybe even make somebody somewhere laugh. we're supposed to be interested in seeing rick mercer visit a gymnastics team and then try to do some of their moves, and then suck at it on purpose while trying desperately to be "funny". rick mercer got old or just lost interest or just ain't funny any more. even his classic rant bits have lost all their bite and humor. you can say that about cbc comedy in general though because how many years have they been sticking air farce on tv to deliver the same kinds of useless jokes?

this is my first almodavar film. i'll confess we chose it mainly because we knew this had the enticing prospect of antonio banderas in gay sex scenes.unfortunately, that is about all that this film has to recommend it. i consider myself a fairly sophisticated viewer, i like european films, "art" films, and i am generally able to recognize a quality film even if it is not to my particular taste.but this film was a complete blank to me. the plot was ridiculous, the characters lifeless, the box called it a "hilarious comedy" but i didn't laugh once. loosly and awkwardly constructed, with a lot of pointless dialogue. i don't get this at all-- it seems like an amateurish effort. can someone enlighten me?

i have now seen quite a few films by pedro almodóvar, but this would have to be the most disappointing so far. this film seemed to lack the zaniness that is usually everywhere in his films, and the story just never got me interested. many almodóvar regulars appear in this film, so it's not like there was a lack of on-screen talent, but this film just seemed more serious than his other films. if there was a comedic edge to this movie, i certainly couldn't find it, and it made for one surprisingly weak movie.

i liked all the lilo and stitch movies. the tv series weren't that great, but i put my opinions of the series aside when i watched this movie. and i must say... it was bad.one thing i found disappointing was the animation. yes, you heard it. the animation. i found its quality greatly degraded since the first movie. its quality was only as high as the tv series', something which i did not expect at all. if you're looking for eye candy, don't expect anything much here. also, the animation failed to portray any serious moods. even in the supposed sad scenes, i didn't feel anything for the character, another downgrade from the first movie.the next, was the absolutely horrible voice acting. i found it very, very unconvincing, and wondered why, disney, with all its riches and glory, couldn't afford voice actors with real talent. the voice actors' skill were just as annoying as the one in the series. i tolerated the one in the series because, hey, who wouldn't be tired out when made to voice act for so many episodes? heck, i don't even know how many episodes there are (theoretically, there are 624, but i just can't believe that). however, i thought that the voice acting would improve in the movie, and i was put down in the face by the truth, that what they could do in the series was already their best.next, was the horrible script. it was cheesy beyond redemption, and the writers just try too hard. they try to put some jokes in, but i just found them annoying. maybe it wasn't the voice acting, but the cheesy dialogues that ruined the sound section. (on the upside, the soundtrack wasn't too bad, and matched the mood quite well.) fourthly was the problem with the storyline. i predicted everything, and the storyline was what made the characters so unoriginal and unlikeable all of a sudden. you have the aliens get new positions and responsibilities inouter space. after the initial hype, they realize that they actually didn't like it and miss their old life. meanwhile, the evil villain gets broken out of jail after a very 'action packed' action scene and breaks in to jumbaa's lab to steal his experiment. the experiment was then cloned into 100 others and the hamster wants to conquer earth. when the main characters find out, they try to stop the evil hamster but gets confronted in some cheesy final showdown against the experiment and owns him in an extremely lame excuse for trying to make the series to look cool. the characters then give up their new privileges and return to earth to resume their life. seriously, how many other movies has used that ending already? the that storyline was extremely short and formulaic, so don't expect too much from it.so disney has failed in sound, graphics and storyline. the only charm of the series was the original characters, and how they managed to retain the 'feel' of the characters, but even that wasn't able to save the movie. i tried to like it, i really did, but i give it a rating of 4/10. another disney failure.

the story is: a turn-of-the-century troupe of actors, along with producers and theatre-owners, have very complicated relationships. a resident playwright has written a psychological drama. he wants to get a good production on stage, but can't unless he convinces a pariticular reviewer to revisit the production, and give a positive review. if his production does not go on, then the troupe will put on the doll house, recently written by ibsen. many different relationships among the principals are explored; none of them interesting. but the involvement of the characters with one another lead to giving the play by the resident playwrght a second shot.this movie is purely an excuse for the director and his friends to get together and put on a movie. the story lines are incoherent to anyone who isn't a buddy of one of the stars. the only reason i didn't leave the theatre after about a half hour is that a fat lady was resting a full meal atop her stomach at the end of my row.

'illuminata' has expanded the limits of john turturro's mediocrity from second rate actor to third rate director, writer and producer. this film was dreadful. it is disjointed and flits from scene to scene with little flow or meaning relevant to the main story line.we are served with a smorgasbord of fragmented scenes, each a non sequitur to all the others. the only thread that seems to run through them is that they occur in the lives of the members of the same theatre repertory company. the few scenes that do matter to the plot are so convoluted that you frequently can't tell if the dialogue is from the story or the actors running their lines for the play within the story. if this story were a person it would be a schizophrenic with mulitple personality disorder. it couldn't decide if it was a drama, a romance, a comedy, a tragedy, a sex farce, or a parody of theatre. it came closest to being bearable as a sex farce. turturro was lifeless and impassive as tuccio, supposedly a complex and passionate writer whose play gets its big chance when the currently running show needs to be cancelled due to the illness of the lead actor. susan sarandon gave a good performance as the aging actress trying to seduce tuccio for a role. unfortunately, she found it necessary to go topless which only goes to illustrate that the hardware of aging sex symbols is much better left to the imagination. christoher walkin gave a delightful performance as the uppity theatre critic who makes impassioned overtures to a member of the cast. beverly d'angelo and ben gazzara also had minor roles.i gave this film a 2. other than walken's vignette, there is really not much to recommend it except that the puppets used in the opening and closing credits were phenomenally lifelike and beautiful. avoid this movie like the plague that it is.

this movie treads on very familiar ground -- the confusion of art and reality in the life of actors. it does not have anything particularly novel or interesting to say on this subject and is in fact rather dull. the final scene in particular is interminably tedious. seeing the audience crying at the "moving" acting they are seeing on the screen made me ask "who do they think they are kidding?"nevertheless there are some good performances and interesting scenes, particularly from some of the minor characters. ben gazzara plays an old and slightly touched actor, who gets a whole posse of policemen clapping his performance when they come to arrest him.christopher walken again plays an over-the-top wacko. remember his character "the continental" on saturday night live; an aging eurotrash satyr chasing a young woman around the furniture and trying to get her into bed? he does an identical turn in the film, chasing his young (male) prey around an antique table and plying him with champagne.overall this film was both enchanting and irritating, but mostly irritating.

it's partly bad luck for "illuminata" that it comes out after "shakespeare in love" as it deals with virtually the same themes of life as art, art as life and the magic of the theatre and the same archetypal foibles of theater folk, but a whole lot more ponderously.there are scenes that come alive, as a play develops and gets reinterpreted by a writer's life, but there's a whole lot of orson welles-ish ego in this produced by/directed by/lead acted by john torturro as a vehicle for his wife katharine borowitz (with an adorable cameo by their son).each actor gets his/her moment literally in the spotlight, but there's so many "masques" or set pieces that seem like 19th century parlor games. bill irwin talks. susan sarandon gets to be a diva. christopher walken gets to be a different kind of villain - a gay critic. the women have to disrobe unnecessarily because this is an art film.the art and set direction are marvelous, though quite dark. this should get an award as the best use of a jersey city theater as a set ever in a movie. (originally written 8/21/99)

i don't mind the odd artsy film. but when they are larded with arcane symbolism and murky dialogue and when it's obvious they were done for the filmmaker's ego rather than the viewer's benefit, i get upset. i'm not a stupid person yet i simply didn't understand what this film was trying to say. or do. film is a magnificent form of human communication. why do some filmmakers use it instead for obfuscation?

best around the middle, when most characters get horny and go after someone they haven't had before. it is around this point that we get to see susan sarandon's majestic breasts (even if through a veil). strangely enough, beverly d'angelo who isn't shy about nudity doesn't show any at all, while aida turturro  of all people  does. on the other end of the spectrum, the less said about walken playing a homosexual the better. the film itself has little plot; the dialogs from the theater play and the "normal" dialogs cross over often and that's not the sort of thing i'd consider a good idea. life in the theater: who cares? occasionally the dialog has something going for it, but the film drags in stretches.

while i'm normally a big fan of john turturro's work as an actor and director, illuminata is a great disappointment. although the film has some charming moments, overall it falls flat. worst of all, the film is confusing. where is the movie set? italy or an italian troupe in new york? why bother making a historical film if it fails to convey a setting? if you want to see a well-made, inspiring historical film also about theater, go see tim robbins' the cradle will rock. this movie has many pluses, including a fine performance by john turturro.

i went into this film really wanting to like it - it headlined a film festival earlier in the year, and boasted an all-star cast. but (and you could tell there was a "but" coming) it's a failure of a film. outstanding character acting by sarandon and walken is destroyed by editing and the antics of the supporting cast. turturro's performance is lackluster, and most of the comedy is overplayed. the recurring puppet shows are pointless, and a few scenes are completely out of place.that said, there are some wonderful moments sprinkled in the film. a genuinely touching stage moment, several of the seductions, and a few of the comedic color actually work out. unfortunately, they're overshadowed by the diffuse, incoherent script and some bad acting.

r.i.c.c.o. is the stupidest film ever made. i can't believe my father bought this crap. this film should da never got made. if this film was wide known, trust me it will be on the #1 spot for imdb's worst.the acting is horrible it's scary,which it is why it's horror. this piece of s*** had no horror in at at all. it's an urban action,which is funny, because i could of swore it was a comedy. when people got shot i couldn't help but laugh. i am the only person who reviewed this and i hope that i am the last. with this vote only i hope it make it to the #1 spot at the worst!!!!!!!

a movie this dumb should never see the light of day. the acting is lame, the violence is just all over the place, the sneaking ending is just plain stupid.it's all about a lawyer who saw a murder done by the r.i.c.c.o. squad. no one has never seen him, not even the hit men themselves. so he and a beautiful lady are on the run trying to find the leader of this r.i.c.c.o. squad, before they find them.then the movie goes on to a romance, gun shooting, and voodoo. now how in the hell did voodoo come in this. never see this film if your life depends on it. trust me!!!!!!!!

adored by fans for his unusually charming creativity and by hollywood for his softball, user-friendly movie-making techniques, tim burton tipped the scales too far in formula's favor with his new upset of a cinematic legend, sleepy hollow. following the quest of ichabod crane  played by johnny depp, delivering this dreary film's only shining point  to the heart of the mystery surrounding a town's seemingly random and gruesome murders by a fabled headless horseman, the story plays out as if it were purposely trying to be repugnantly predictable. contrived as a children's bedtime story, humdrum character introduction is laced with intended-upon exciting non-engaging chase scenes which, with undeveloped characters fleeing for their lives, produce about as much fright and thrill as the nightmare before christmas.toss in an endless bundle of old trees for ambience and a wide-eyed, big-busted blonde love interest (christina reechi) and burton has himself a movie that takes the age-old legend of sleepy hollow and succeeded in making it like a disney movie without the charm or captivation. dialog was choppy and ridiculous, severed heads were aplenty, and there were enough plot-revealing monologues to embarrass the likes of james bond. even with the backing of emmanuel lubezki, the most sought-after cinematographer in hollywood today, the wonderful acting of depp and burton's astounding name-recognition, sleepy hollow is nothing to lose your head over.

i have in the past loved tim burton. i loved ed wood, edward scissorhands, and even mars attacks. but i hate this movie. the costume drama scenes in the beginning were the sort of poorly done, stodgy things that used to plague historical drama 25 years ago. then there were all the head-cutting scenes, which just left me cold, and that's the sort of thing that ought to mean something, i would think. yes, there were some nice bare trees and foggy evenings and the horseman jumping out of the tree was a nice special effect, but on the whole the movie was just boring and pointless.

this film had a lot of potential - it's a great story and has the potential to be very creepy. but of course tim burton doesn't really do creepy films, he does wacky cartoonish films. and i usually like tim burton's stuff. but i thought this film was really weak. the best thing about the film (and it is actually worth seeing just for this) was the art direction - the film has an amazing intangible quality to it. the script was not good. it was boring in parts and confusing in other parts, and there was no building of characters. i never really cared that people were having their heads lopped off by a headless being. i thought johnny depp had a good thing going with his approach to the character, but given that the script was weak he couldn't go too far with it - and i was very irritated by the attempts at a slight accent on his and christina ricci's parts.anyway, it is sadly not a great film and not worth seeing unless you are interested in the art direction.

several things become apparent after the first few minutes of this film. first, the scenery and special effects are incredible -- the best, and if everything else worked as well, its austere presence might have made it a great film.but as soon as the actors open their mouths, you suddenly realize that you are sitting in your den watching a movie. the story itself is full of cleché and melodrama, and the dialogue is some of the worst i've ever seen. and as if that weren't bad enough, they made a fool out of the protagonist, and in my experience, you don't want to do that unless the film is a comedy.bottom line: i had a hard time getting into it, and i wouldn't recommend it.

surely this film was hacked up by the studio? perhaps not but i feel there were serious flaws in the storytelling that if not attributed to the editing process could only be caused by grievously bad, criminal indeed, writing and directing.i understand the effect burton wished to achieve with the stylised acting similar to the gothic fairytale atmosphere of edward scissorhands, but here unfortunately it falls flat and achieves no mythical depth of tropes but only the offensive tripe of affectation. ie bad acting and shallow characterisation even for a fairytale.finally not that scary, indeed only mildly amusing in its attempts. the use of dialogue as a vehicle for plot background was clumsy and unnecessary. the mystery of who is the headless horseman would suffice, no need for the myth about a german mercenary, although christopher walken did cut a dashing figure but not that menacing - seeing the horsemans head makes him seem far friendlier that a decapitated inhuman nine foot tall spirit as in the original legend.no real rhythm or universal tone was ever established and not a classic in burtons oevure. stilted and clipped as my parting shot...

the original review i had planned for this movie was perhaps a little over-harsh, so i'll preface with the good: sleepy hollow is a perfectly acceptable beer-and-pizza or sleepover movie, the kind you watch with a good group of people when the mood is light and no-one's really focusing on the movie. the visual elements are beautiful, and it is kinda fun, in parts. but horror, my friends, it is not. i made the mistake of watching it expecting something to shiver at with all the lights off. if this is your intention, send me a personal message and i'll offer you a list of alternate recommendations. (that's a serious offer, by the way. true horror fans deserve better.) now my complaints, complete with spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers why bother even making a movie "based" on a classic story if you're not even going to attempt to stay true to the sense, feel, tone, or theme of the original? listen carefully between the lines of ill-written dialogue and you'll hear the slow churn of washington irving rolling over in his grave. i will even accept the big-city detective bit, but... ricci drawing warding-hexes around the bed? come, now. not only is there nothing even vaguely like this in "the legend of sleepy hollow", but it's historical bunk. i don't care what neo-pagan axe you have to grind, but in the 18th century, "witchcraft" meant selling your soul to the devil in exchange for diabolical powers; this whole fluffy white-witch goddess-worship "an'-it-harm-none" approach to witchcraft dates back, historically, about as far as the british invasion. (parties interested in real old-school pagan practices are referred to james frazer's "the golden bough", if you don't believe me.) this creates such a discordant element thrown into the context of the film that the very framework of the sleepy hollow legend is shattered. so we wind up with a totally different story altogether. if that was burton's idea, i wish he'd warned us in advance. also, i wish he'd come up with a better story than the rather pedestrian one witnessed here. and he might as well have dropped the irving pretensions altogether. and, at any rate, the movie isn't scary. not once. not at all. the warped tree came close, but was more than counterbalanced by the laughable effect of the hessian's farce-comedy bellowing. and finally, yes, i too wanted christina ricci for christmas, but god clearly never meant her to be a blonde.

this movie is the worst ever!!! sorry but this was a total waste of good hours. quasi-psychology and b-actors makes a baaaad horror movie. you can say that if you are into bad movies you will adore this one. and the "hot chick" wasn't all that hot. there is absolutely no climax to the movie, and the worst part is the ending song. some homemade thing with these words "its in awful condition the world is a mess. when heads fall of bodies and girls wont stay dressed. the cops they are clueless, eating donuts in their car. newspaperflash next morning: headless body,topless bar." jesus! sorry guys, but milks gone bad with this one.

generally speaking, i'm a an admirer of jess franco's film-making but, for some of this movies, i really have difficulties understanding the motivation behind them or even their reason of existence. like this sick puppy, for example. "sadomania" has absolutely no cinematic value, it's poorly made without any sort of plot and featuring some of the most ill-natured sleaze footage ever captured on film. this is another filthy women-in-prison film where rape, lesbian-action and violent torture games are daily routine. the guards are crazier than the prisoners and the institution is protected by an impotent governor who only gets sexually aroused when he spots a girl having sex with a dog (!). the girls are all very beautiful and naked throughout the entire film, yet you can't really enjoy this sight with all the perversion going on. the dubious highlights include a barbaric hunting game (you can guess what he prey is), a duel-to-death between a guard and a prisoner and the image of a poor girl having a needle injected all the way through her nipple. auch! avoid this sick mess and you'll save yourself the trouble of taking two baths in order to wash the filth off.

i can't help thinking that this is franco's 'hamage' to the marquis de sade's "one thousand days of sodom". people (in this case women) abducted to serve as slaves to a privileged elite? check. kinky sex? check. torture including whipping? check. victims chosen at random to be killed? check.thank goodness franco didn't go the whole hog and introduce cinema audiences to the delights of coprology (and indeed coprophagy), another perversion that crops up repeatedly in de sade's tediously long and disgusting saga.i rather hoped that this film would fall into the 'so bad it's good' category. but even the acres of naked flesh and numerous sexual encounters didn't make up for the dismal dialogue, dreadful acting, elusive plot and - just to put the tin hat on it - dubbing and english sub-titles (a belt and braces approach missing from the women's costumes). the alsation gave a very professional performance though.of course i could be wrong about the de sade angle. after all, i failed to realise that the actor playing the head warden at the 'prison' was a trans-sexual. i must pay more attention to the size of people's hands in future.according to another reviewer, the film was banned in the uk. well it clearly isn't any more, though i fancy that the nipple-needling scene was cut to satisfy the censors. on the dvd i watched, it was only clearly visible on the spanish trailer (which, in case you're wondering, i watched to compare it with the english one).the dvd also features an interview with jess franco, though you'll need better spanish than mine to understand it. unless i'm much mistaken it's neither dubbed nor sub-titled. and it points out that the person sodomising the character played by franco is ajita wilson disguised using a moustache. kind of ironic, given that (s)he had had the requisite appendage surgically removed.

a bare-faced rip-off of se7en and not fit to clean its shoes. the word 'predictable' must have invented for just such an occasion as this. lambert is wooden, as always (his moments of 'emotion' are laughable, as is his accent). the 'climax' is not that at all as we've had so many signals, and by the end we're simply immune to flesh, rotting and otherwise. altogether a real mess.

ok. first said, i just wanted to check whether this movie has an average rating below or exactly -1. but 5,9. this is sicker than any of the killers' proceedings -,- . that made me curious what people wrote here.. which in the end made me set up an account to give my 2cents of truth into this "well of delusion" i find here.how dare you guys even mention this movie in the same sentences as e.g. seven? the only thing they got in common is that they show various crime-scenes. that-is-it. and "best thriller of 1999!" ? have you even watched another movie form that year? or any other movie in your life at all? 1999 is not a year which people are reminded of by resurrection... what's with actual movies like 8mm, eyes wide shut, arlington road, double jeopardy? (theyre actually more a "thriller" than this one could ever be..). resurrection does not even deserve to be dedicated to a second of 1999.really, you guys can't be serious. i watched that movie yesterday with my girlfriend, highly recommended by a friend of her. a "great film with christopher lambert"! ...which i had not yet seen? hmm.. well, first look on the covers: ok, nothing special. at second glimpse you don't need to have supernatural powers to be aware that they simply mirrored lambert's head, clipped his nose 'n this&that, then made a fancy negative pattern on top of it, to get the killers image on the cover. you could even think they had some apprentice eat a gallon of marshmallows just to caption that creepy (booooh! -.- ) mouth.. whatever. turned it around and the plot starts with.. "it's raining in chicago... blabber blabber". come on, a six year old could have made that snippet sound more exciting. now, with this enormous excitement coming from the movies terrific presentation -.- , you absolutely wanna start watching it. because it can't be that bad, it still is christopher lambert. that assumption of mine was proved wrong. with "proven wrong" i mean it was brutally executed by a deadly mix of the worst imaginable acting ever known to mankind (every actor, but the tops are the "i can do 1-liners!" police chief, prudhommes wife __ actually a better detective than prudhomme when she recombines several incidents to a yet absolutely unknown hint in the case!!!! -.- __ and .. yes.. prudhomme himself) featuring a squadron of inhuman fake feelings, logic errors in a 1-minute-cycle, light-years far-fetched conclusions which in my point-of-view represent an insult to any thinking human being and last but not least a camera-man who obviously was a hyperventilating kangaroo. oh well, and if you do not completely shut down your brains (these aren't premises to watch it) then you should know who is who and what is what after max. 30minutes, simply because you know any scene after the first. that is thrilling. thrilling because this movie almost makes you think you can tell the future. the bottom line: this is by far the worst movie i can remember. trust me, i've seen many horrible movies which in some way were at least only bad attempts or bad copies of another movie. resurrection however, is the best example on how to fail in every aspect possible. it was so bad that after being shocked by its unimaginably low quality in e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g, i laughed more often than in any recent comedy, simply because i was fascinated by the crew's brazenness to publish such an -extraordinary- film strip. good thing for lambert he was in highlander:endgame a year later, thus he can be pardoned. ;^oanyhow, i do recommend watching this movie to everyone. in the end, we had great fun watching it :^d. i guarantee you, after you completely watched resurrection (be brave, you can do it!) , you will worship the level of acting in any given daily soap. or just go 'n watch highlander one more time... that's what i'm gonna do.

this film truly was poor. i went to the theatre expecting something exciting, and instead was afforded the opportunity to hone my "guess the next plot twist before it happens" skills. seriously, the plot was written with an extra thick crayon so everyone could see. nothing was truly shocking. in fact, even the gore was met with such complete suspension of belief that it really didn't add up to much.the excessive wise cracking and cops talking shop at the crime scenes made it seem all the more phony. and the scene where lambert's character is struggling with the clues and reaches his "investigative epiphany" goes to great lengths to indicate the level of intellect expected from the audience - little.probably the most annoying aspect of the cinematography was the "x-files" treatment: every building in the film, whether it's the precinct building, or a house at noon, or a hospital, was suffering from a lack of any discernible lighting (not to mention a lack of 'patients' in the case of the hospital). i don't recall a single scene when someone flipped on a light switch. it sure would have been nice.mr. lambert really isn't an oscar-grade actor, so i suppose you have to take this film for what it's worth. in the end, i've reached the conclusion that the only thing that would make this film seem more entertaining is to watch it after watching "the warriors". otherwise, you're left with an effort that is dull and unoriginal, and nowhere near the equal of films of the genre such as "silence of the lambs".

overrated, poorly written, badly acted. did the academy even watch this? i guess not. the political content guaranteed it an oscar nomination -- indo -pak border -- a little boy , terrorism. anything with the word "terrorist" gets attention inthis post 9-11 world. its like holocaust movies that are guaranteed an oscar nomination irrespective of their merits. and please cinematography does not mean shooting landscapes which are pretty in the first place. you have to be a rotten shooter to screw up making the desert pretty. at least this didn't win the oscar. they got that right at least. would have been a travesty.

i survived the first hour of this and came back for the last ten minutes, just to say i saw the end. if you want *real* mythology, flawlessly executed, look for armand assante's "the odyssey." great storytelling doesn't need to be tweaked - the stories are fantastic on their own. i only hope sean astin needed the money. and sophocles and ovid must be whirling in their graves - wherever those may be.at least with sorbo's version, the tongue was poked relentlessly in cheek - we knew it was mostly balderdash, but perhaps enough interest was generated in the backstory to send someone to the library.i'm surprised halmi could turn out something so amusing (the tv series), and follow it with something so devoid of quality.

this is easily the worst adaptation of greek mythology i've ever seen. it utterly fails as an adaptation of the original myth, inventing silly plot twists and reducing the 12 labours to... 3 or 4, i think. it makes up utterly needless things to try to integrate other myths in clumsy ways which bring into question the writers' having ever read the myths, like changing birds to harpies, lions to sphinxes, the oracle of delphi to tiresias, and bulls to a pedantic version of proteus, even integrating aspects, never seen outside of sam raimi's entertaining series, concerning his first marriage, to a woman with the co-opted name of one of the furies so it sounds appropriate to the period.i could accept much of that, but it also fails completely in pure film standards; most painful is the dialogue, leaden, portentous pseudo-shakespearean tripe. it is a poor re-interpretation of the myths, making a sad attempt at the kind of post-modern revisionism that crichton's "the 13th warrior" attempted in regards to the beowulf legend, while still including the strictly mythological elements such as clear interference from the gods and magical super-strength. a sad, sad failure of an entertainment experience, who i'm sure many of the quality actors involved regret deeply.

i don't know how expensive was the creation of this movie but the effects were awful. half of the movie was filmed on stage in front of a movie canvas (that's sure that blue box wouldn't look so artificial). when they traveled on a boat, the background canvas was moved imitating the movement of waves but the characters weren't moving. the cgi effects: terrible (i am not sure but i guess the effect were created with paint and made a gif sequence of them - next time the creators should hire a professional cgi maker team). it looks like the cgi creator would have drawn on the picture strip with shaky hands. awful, that's sure. when i first saw the trailer, i thought it was created in 1983. one of my friend told me the correct date: 2005. my jaw dropped, i was so shocked, i thought he was kidding. people, i recommend you to skip this movie, the story is also twisted, you won't enjoy it.

eh. i watch this movie in class because someone taped it and brought it in. i was expecting some half hearted attempt to portray the herakles myths, and because the commercials for it looked serious, i was expecting something that was halfway decent.ten minutes into the film, i realized that it was utter crap. the only things in the film that are halfway true to the myth are the bare(and i mean bare) minimum. parents, half brother, and labors seemed to be named correctly. other than that, the rest of the film seemed to be one giant inaccuracy. i would say that this was not much better than the disney version of the film. the disney version was made for little kids, therefore wasn't too serious. this movie, with all the sex, violence, and nudity, was clearly intended for an older audience, yet the story presented in this was nearly inaccurate as the disney film.

i thought there might be some level of worth to this movie, and sat through the whole thing. i can summarize by saying it left a bad taste in my mouth.the movie started out ok, i think the initial characterization of herc was true to the myths. both as a child and a young adult he started out pretty strong but not the brightest bulb. but later on he somehow transforms into a charismatic speaker beloved by all. huh? other problem: terrible cgi. the satyr looked ok, but the rest of the critters just looked terrible, especially the hart, the phoniest looking beast in the movie. and how come leelee sobieski's skin was sometimes golden, sometimes normal? the worst part for me--and everyone should cringe at this--was the twelve labors of hercules. because the producers obviously didn't want to cover all of them; maybe they thought us primitive screw-heads watching this garbage couldn't count that high. instead of the twelve labors of hercules, we got the five labors of hercules. yes, the five labors! wtf?!? he did't even finish the last one, so it was really the 4 1/2 labors! just terrible. i'll take hercules: the legendary journeys over this piece of crap any day of the week.

my guess would be this was originally going to be at least two parts, and thus at least a quarter longer, because otherwise how can one explain its confused, abbreviated storyline. i was never completely lost, but i was often partially lost and usually unclear on character motivation. the movie feels as though joining plot points were dropped to squeeze it into its time slot.if it were longer, it might make more sense, but it still wouldn't be much good. the movie's most interesting idea is of the war between zeus and hera as being a war between the male and female, but the movie drops the ball on this, making hera's followers fairly horrible while not being clear on what zeus' followers do or believe. the movie is also interesting because you don't see the gods and there's no real certainty that they exist. so it's got a couple of intriguing ideas, but it doesn't do anything useful with them.bad dialog, cardboard characters, and one interesting scene involving hercules and his three antagonistic sons. not unwatchable but also not worth watching.

originally harped as a sequel to "the slumber party massacre" series, this film falls flat on it's face with a new title. first off, if you are going to include the word "massacre" in your film's title, you better deliver. this one certainly does not. there is no gore, no on screen murders and no chainsaw, as the box art would lead you to believe. instead, we get a paper thin, overdone plot about a group of cheerleaders who get stranded in an abandoned cabin on the way to a football game, only to be offed one by one. again, this film could have been ok if the gore quotient was upped a bit. why directors, especially those doing direct-to-video flicks, are afraid to show any gore is beyond me. now, i am not a huge fan of excessive gore, but come on...why else would anyone rent a movie called "cheerleader massacre??" besides that problem, the film suffers from a shot-on-a-home-video-camera cheapness. it looks cheap, sounds cheap, and the actors aren't all that good. it tries to throw us off track to who the killer may be, but even that fails. the ending ends up being a ridiculous mess. folks, if you run across this film, walk away and go find the original "slumber party massacre." 2 out of 10.

"based on a joke once told by jim wynorski"... that's what i've read at the end of the closing credits. well, mr. wynorski gotta have an awful sense of humour then! this film is terrible, really. i loved the first two chapters of the slumber party massacre series; the third film was quite useless, but completely watchable, compared to this piece of crap! there's not even a driller killer and the plot, the acting, the characters, the locations, the events... everything is boring, absurd and laughable. the only good reason to watch this turkey are the girls: if this film were a porn, i think it would have worked really much better! the film lacks gore too: the first scene (the one in the tent) could be bloodier and the scene with the headless guy knocking at the door lasted one second! some moments of slight thrilling can't save a nonexistent plot. buzzy (lunk johnson) seems to be the only real actor here: i found him the only bearable character in this movie! oh... there's a nonsense part with brinke stevens, who performed "linda" in the first slumber party massacre: the police bother her to know more details about the killer; but what we get is only some footage from the first film! not a dialogue, neither a monologue, or anything from this still-traumatized grown-up girl, who's forced to revive the worst 30 minutes of her life (as she says), giving us no clues at all about the murderer!watch at your own risk.

this movie was one of those movies where it completely fooled me into thinking that it was a cheesy 80's slasher flick, based on the cover, but it wasn't. it was quite possibly one of the worst slasher films that i have ever seen. the picture on the cover did not match any part or scene in the movie; in fact it didn't involve a chainsaw. not even the tag line fit the movie. the film is about a group of cheerleaders and two potheads who escape to a desolate cabin, in the cold woods, for a weekend getaway. however, things get extra chilly when they start to get murdered by an unknown killer. at the same time, the local sheriff's department is hunting down a dangerous killer. i'll name the problems in a list.1. the acting. boy was it cheap and horribly bad. it felt unnatural and it seemed as thought it was very scripted. none of the actors seemed as though they tried to perform with good intentions and therefore they seemed silly and tired. there was bad acting by all the characters in the movie, so i won't point out specific people, but i wills say that the stoners did a horrible job, as well as the police and the cheerleaders, which is not a surprise.2. the plot. this story had set up a perfect storyline for good ol' fashion slasher flick, but instead they peppered it with plot-holes, useless and unnecessary scenes and an overall stupid back-story to the killer's intentions. there were major plot-holes including how the killer killed the last victim so quickly and yet still be there in the group of girls when it happened? the ex-con virtually served no purpose in the movie aside from being a useless plot device. there was random and unnecessary sex and nudity sprinkled throughout it, even for a b-movie or my taste it was a bit too much. as for the killer's intentions, lets just say it was stupid and it makes no sense as to why she / he is killing young girls. plus, there was also some very predictable kills that i saw coming about 30 miles away.3. the technical side. the lighting was okay, it certainly wasn't the worse lighting that i've seen in a movie, but there were points where it was supposed to be dark but it looked more like the afternoon. the house seemed darker with the lights on, then with the lights off. the camera work was average, it didn't have any good establishing shots or amazing pans or zooms, thought it did get the job done is building some suspense with it's framing.overall, this movie, in the sense of plot, character development and performance, was a huge disappointment and a waste of my time. what i thought would have been a great slasher flick turned out to be one of the worse movies that i have ever seen. the acting was really bad and wooden, there was hardly any sense in the plot and there was no emotion to this film. however, the technical aspect of this film saved it for me, because if the camera work or the lighting was bad, then i would have turned off the dvd player and popped in something else. i would recommend this movie to those who enjoy really cheesy b-movies as well as those who follow cult classics, because this movie certainly is. i would partially recommend this film for those who enjoy 80s slasher flicks. but for me, this movie was pitiful and utterly horrible.

like curse of the komodo was for the creature feature genre, jim wynorski's cheerleader massacre is a straight-faced parody of slasher movies, such as slumber party massacre. a psycho, who has escaped from his padded cell,(..he was sent to the loony bin thanks to killing eleven people)is working across the mountainous backwoods countryside of bobcat county attacking anyone within his reach. a van load of cheerleaders, their teacher, two equipment hands, and the driver are on their way to a contest when their vehicle runs out of fuel while taking a supposed short-cut to avoid having to turn back. luckily the group find a cabin up ahead, but fall prey to a killer who attacks each victim one by one. the psycho loose in the county couldn't have killed one girl because she was in the cheerleaders' locker room while he was elsewhere which means someone among their own is the culprit. meanwhile the sheriff of the county and his deputy pursue the whereabouts of their psycho, while also trying to find the location of the missing cheerleader squad.shot cheap on video, wynorski does what he can with the limited budget having to find clever ways to assassinate characters off-screen without the luxury of properly effective special effects. in other words, lots of melons were stabbed, the sound effect used to let us know that certain victims whisked away into the darkness by a black gloved hand died savagely. wynorski incorporates a scene from slumber party massacre regarding brinke stevens' character linda, her being pursued by a killer with a drill(..that killer and linda both wound up dead, but i guess wynorski wanted to connect his film to that one, albeit rather poorly)..still it was nice to see her, even if it was a glorified cameo. tamie sheffield, as ms hendricks the teacher of the students in trouble, has a long bathing scene in the shower soaping her naked body and fake breasts. the girls who make up the cheerleaders are a bit unconvincing, because their obviously in their twenties. aging soft-core porn stars samantha philips(..as a police officer who is attacked by the psychopath she's searching for)and nikki fritz(..a hiker who is victimized while jogging across a dangerous bridge)surprisingly don't have to strip. wynorski vets bill langlois monroe(..as sheriff murdock) and melissa brasselle(..as a detective who assists murdock on his case)contribute to the sub-plot of the search for john colton's serial killer mcpherson. interesting enough, the mcpherson story serves as a mcguffan as, in truth, the meat of the film is devoted to the cheerleading group and their perilous situation. i'm not sure if slasher fans will embrace this movie because it takes too long for the kills to flare up and when they eventually enter the picture, the violence isn't potent or shocking enough to satisfy.

hard to get in-depth with this kind of stuff since there is absolutely no existing shred of even partial reason for watching it, let alone expressing an opinion on it. i don't know anything about this - watched it for a laugh and stayed for the fake breasts. apparently, it's an unofficial sequel to 1982's "slumber party massacre", which i did enjoy as a fun slasher. "cheerleader massacre" looks like a late-nite soft-core cinemax porno! and not surprisingly, chicks like nikki fritz and samantha phillips (prolific t&a actresses) are in this. plenty of nekkid hooters and not much else... a group of 20-something high school cheerleaders, two random guys, and the fat, stupid comic-relief slob become stranded in the country and find a house where they plan to stay the night. the recently escaped "slumber party" killer is in the area and begins killing them off. there's no gore or originality and i wouldn't say the nudity is a real "selling point" since this is just about as boring a slasher movie can be. absolutely terrible...

a movie like this makes me appreciate the work that professional actors do. i think movie-goers, in general, are a little too hard on professional actors and are ready to bash them for the most minuscule reasons. just watch a couple minutes of "cheerlader massacre," and trust me, you'll change your views. a razzie would be almost a compliment for these no-talent actors. but then again, it's a jim wynorski film. wynorski is a popular director of these ultra low-budget b-movies (having worked with roger corman on many an occasion). the problem with this movie is it actually tries to develop a plot. and when you have actors delivering lines like they're reading letters off an eye chart, how am i supposed to care? in wynorski's "bare wench 2," he didn't try to develop a plot. he simply tried to make a softcore porn/goofy takeoff on the "blair witch project." it was fun and it was titillating. "cheerleader masscare" is no fun. there are a couple obligatory female nude scenes, but they are few and far between. so it's not even worth enjoying on an erotic level. i must say, the worst scene is the one where nikki fritz walks across a bridge that's about to collapse. first of all, her character didn't have to walk across that bridge. second of all, as the bridge starts creaking, rather than try her best to run across, she just stands there and acts helpless. and top it off, we don't actually see the bridge collapse because the filmmakers made this for a budget of 2 dollars!!! unlike a lot of b-horror films, this one's actually boring. and that's what makes it the worst of all bad movies. one of the few bright spots was lunk johnson, who's probably the most natural actor in the film (though certainly no more than halfway decent). he was funny in "bare wench 2," and had some funny scenes in this movie too.

i've never expected too much from a film by trashy b-movie director jim wynorski: a silly premise, some cheapo effects and a bit of nudity from some busty babes, and i'm usually fairly happy.well, cheerleader massacre delivers on the former and definitely the latter, but unfortunately is a tad light when it comes to the splatter. and when a film has the word 'massacre' in the title, and scrimps on the gore, then houston, we have a problem.wynorski's movie centres on a group of cheerleaders who, along with their teacher, mini-bus driver and a couple of guys, become stranded in the mountains during a snowstorm. they make their way on foot to a deserted mountain retreat, where they find food and shelter. and a crazy killer who wants them all dead! from the outset, good old jim ensures that his film features plenty of scenes loaded with t&a, and includes the obligatory shower scene, along with numerous other moments in which tasty women get nekkid (including a spot of raunchy softcore sex and a very gratuitous three-babes-in-a-hot-tub scene). none of the women look young enough to be cheerleaders (and are never even seen in their outfits), but who cares about such details when they're all too willing to strip off in the name of art?i do care, however, about the movie's numerous lacklustre deaths. with such an extremely lurid title, i had been hoping for some inventive bloodletting to go with all of the bums, bush, and boobs; instead, practically all of the killings occur off-screen or feature next to no gore. only a silly post-decapitation scene (achieved with cheap-as-chips cgi) comes anywhere near to delivering the goods.still, if you're feeling in the mood for some titillation, or a bit of slasher silliness minus the grue, then, at 82 minutes, at least cheerleader massacre won't be too much of a waste of your time.

cheerleader massacre was supposed to be the fourth installment of the slumber party massacre series; if that's what they were doing (which it is considering one actress from the original returns in a small cameo role), they have failed miserably and made, by far, the worst installment of the 'quadrilogy'. cheerleader massacre seamlessly combines bad acting, a horrible plot, a dumb killer, dull and boring deaths, boring scenery, and hideous camera work to make it one of the worst films ever made. did i already mention how bad it was? don't get me wrong: this cheesy and retarded excuse for a horror film is nowhere near as bad as napoleon dynamite, but it is undeniably a horrible movie.cheerleader massacre is an exact polar opposite of the original slumber party massacre. stay away by all means! this movie is utter garbage!

slasher sequel (fourth slumber part massacre film) concerns a group of nubile cheerleaders stranded in a mountainous cabin in the snow, being offed by a deranged killer. typical slasher elements for hardcore slasher fans, gore, wonderfully gratuitous female nudity, no plot. though it wears out its welcome eventually, even at its short length.original star brinke stevens makes a cameo, which only seems to be there for the sake of including her in the movie.

ouch. this is one ugly movie. not only is it badly acted, but it absolutely destroyed the book as well. horrible. how you could mess up such a classic book is beyond me, but they sure did. don't even think about even renting this.

this movie is one of the poorest adaptations of a fabulous book that i've seen. jean george's novel is a fantastic book that i think is an outstanding read for any child. i can't give the same endorsement to this movie.

i hardly know where to begin.huge continuity issues, bad acting, etc. for example, sam is supposed to be far from any people yet you can see the ski slopes cut into the mountain next to his head.but the most fundamental problem is that the essence of the book, sam's adventurousness paving the way to improve the lot of his entire family, is not even touched upon. instead, in the movie, he gets ticked off at his family and leaves his wealthy parents to be by himself and, when he gets tired of it, he goes home. where is his development? where is the arc?if you have never read the book and can get through the hokey 60isms (double/triple/quadruple visions of the falcon) and terrible production quality (crackling, ahem, fire, winter winds stopping their howling for the dialog and then restarting, etc.) i guess it *might* be ok for an 8 year old. but compared to the sophistication of the book it is a terrible disappointment. read the book instead.

the movie isn't too bad, up until...the main problem is with the ending, so it's a pretty major spoiler...for the time it was made, it's a beautiful movie, and does get a lot of it right.however...in the book, sam succeeds and lives his dream, whereas in the movie, he gives up and goes back to the city, completely destroying the "you can do what you put your mind to" theme of the book.this movie is a desecration, and instead of remaking classics that don't need redone, the hollywood types who haven't any better ideas should do this one, right this time.

role-reversal remake of 1942's "the major and the minor" has jerry lewis stepping into the part originally played by ginger rogers, but unfortunately this anemic outing is missing a lot more than just ginger. lewis attempts to pass for a child when boarding a train; he's successful, but the deception leads to a string of comic and romantic confusions. sidney sheldon adapted the screenplay, tossing in musical moments for dean martin (playing yet another in his stable of second-bananas) and a jewel-robbery subplot (which is dire). diana lynn, who played the wily teenager in the original film, plays lewis' love-interest here. she's cute; jerry isn't. *1/2 from ****

with al jolson at the height of his popularity and warner brothers's the jazz singer having been the highest grossing film of 1927, it was inevitable that the other studios would churn out a few vehicles for their own jolson-esquire characters. but while the jazz singer was a sensation for its being the first part-talkie, the matinée idol lacks the singing voice of its star (the now obscure johnnie walker), and has to make do with just his visual antics.the matinée idol was an early directorial assignment for the renowned frank capra. capra's first couple of full-length features for harry langdon reveal a very showy, excessive style, which made langdon's already mediocre slapstick almost unwatchable. a couple of pictures later and capra has learnt to ease off a bit, with some fairly regular and decent camera-work. however he still shows no aptitude for shooting physical comedy. the longest comic routine - the stage performance - seems to have a few good gags, but it's all cut up into lots of different camera angles, and there is no chance for the comedy to flow naturally from the performances. theoretically, a good portion of the jokes are in the intertitles, but there are far too many of these and none of them is especially funny.of course, capra would eventually mature into a fine dramatic and romantic director, and you can see him beginning to develop in this respect. he cuts down the line, closing in on walker and bessie love in the scene where she first lays eyes on him in his don wilson get up, neatly establishing the wordless connection between them. then there is some beautiful and tender framing of the couple in their scene together at the masquerade, which is all very reminiscent of the love scenes in capra's early 30s output.johnnie walker, columbia's answer to al jolson, is not an exceptional talent. his comic timing is good but there is nothing to make him stand out. bessie love on the other hand is a pretty good actress too, with a very expressive face. kudos to her for getting involved with the physical comedy and losing her dignity with the boys. there's also a good role for lionel belmore, that rotund and jolly character actor who seems to turn up in absolutely everything in the late 20s and early 30s.the matinée idol is one of those pictures that has gained more than its fair share of attention thanks to its director later having made a handful of masterpieces. in and of itself it is a very uninteresting piece, and like most of capra's work before he met robert riskin, a disappointment.

royal rumble 1988 bored me pretty damn good. the rumble itself is pretty uneventful, filled with mid carders, and a winner that really had no point in winning, and why on earth did the young stallions vs the islanders main event? half the crowd left. jessie ventura sounds bored, through half the thing, and you can tell when he mentions he finds the development of hogan vs andre more interesting. mcmahon and ventura don't have the chemistry of gorilla and jessie.ricky steamboat vs ravishing rick rude. heavily disappointing match, with too many rest holds, and too much of a sluggish pace, sink this one. when it picks up like crazy in the last 5 minutes, it's too little, too late. steamboat wins by dq.2 1/2 /5next is up dino bravo attempting to set a new bench press record, with ventura spotting him. horrendous segment, with no entertainment value what so ever. ventura is not nearly enough to carry this segment, and even mcmahon admitted it was boring. controversy or not, i wasted enough time on this crap.0/5wwf woman's tag team championship.2 out of 3 falls.the glamour girls|c|/w jimmy hart. vs the jumping bomb angels. this is the best match of the night, no i'm not kidding!. very exciting stuff for woman's wrestling, and you'll be hard pressed to find stuff this good, now a days. the jumping bomb angels were way over, and the crowd went ape sh*t for their title win.3/5contract signing between hulk hogan and andre the giant. hogan gets a decent pop, but there a few noticeable boo's for him, probably because its in canada. a bit too drawn out for my liking, but it was necessary for the storyline. it got it's point across, and had some effective moments, but a lot of the times, i kept saying "get on with it". both sign, and andre slams hogan's head on the table, and pushes the table on him.2 1/2 /5royal rumble match. very weak royal rumble, probably due to awkward pacing, and the true lack of star power. i think vince was testing the waters with this one, and it showed. ventura seems uninterested, and i don't blame him. crowd clearly wanted roberts to win, yelling ddt almost every 5 minutes he was in there, and while duggan got a good pop, i don't believe he was the winner they wanted, and where did this take his career? nowhere. bret's 1st ever royal rumble, and he made an impressive showing. it wasn't terrible, but it was quite lackluster, and it didn't have enough to make the show, considering this was what the show was based on.2 1/2 /5hogan has an interview with craig degeorge. standard hulkster interview, but not with the same craziness, and outrageous remarks he usually pulls.2/5ted and andre get interviewed. andre claims he will deliver the championship to mr. dibiase. short, but effective.3/52 out of 3 falls.the islanders vs the young stallions. crowd is completely dead for this, and half of them bolted for the exit's. it's quite dull, and had no business being in the main event. jessie and vince seem bored, and argue about other things while the match is taking place. islanders win, due to taking advantage of roma's injury.2/5bottom line. historically important i suppose, but there is really nothing to see here. this was just a starting cue for great things to come for the royal rumble, and while you can see glimpses of potential here, there is nothing on here, going out of your way to see. i usually recommend everything once for die hard wrestling fans, and considering it's the 1st royal rumble event, i suppose i have too, but prepare to be bored a lot of the time.3/10

i bought this 'film' from a gas station in the 3.99 bin for one reason: billy drago, who is one of my favorite actors. he is terrifically creepy and good, but that's where it stops. the movie itself is a dirt cheap, gratingly awful attempt at a horror western, and manages neither, never mind a successful merging of the two genres. the acting besides drago's is so bad i wanted to put the couch cushions over my ears, the production values are nonexistent and the script , i don't even know where to start.avoid at all costs unless you are a die hard drago fan like me.terrible, shameful unforgivable.

an interesting premise, and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nut-bag (side note: i'd love to see drago, stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together; talk about raging cheekbones!). the soundtrack wasn't terrible, either.but the acting--even that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochon--was terrible, the directing worse (perhaps contributory to the former), the dialog chimp-like, and the camera work, barely tolerable. still, it was the sets that got a big "10" on my "oy-vey" scale. i don't know where this was filmed, but were i to hazard a guess, it would be either an open-air museum, or one of those re-enactment villages, where everything is just a bit too well-kept to do more than suggest the "real old west". okay, so it was shot on a college kid's budget. that said, i could have forgiven one or two of the aforementioned faults. but taken all together, and being generous, i could not see giving it more than three stars.

alleged "scream queen" debbie rochon and her group of frontier prostitutes travel west to the title location and encounter grisly killings that turn out to be the work of a cult of ex-confederate psychopaths attempting to resurrect the south through pointless massacre.action and suspense take a backseat to loads of boring dialog and uninteresting character development.billy drago is good in the thankless (not to mention pointless) role of the town mortician but everything else about this wannabe slasher western is extremely poor, including the town and the fort, both of which look like modern made western tourist traps and costumes that look like they were bought at party city.do yourself a big favor and watch ravenous instead.

this movie is about a group of women (perhaps not of the highest repute) who are heading to a small fort to take over a recently departed uncles property where they plan to set up shop. upon arrival in a nearby city they find no one will go there (even though its only 15 miles away), so they walk. when they get there they find there are no soldiers but a good amount of people who have taken over use of the fort and built up a small city nearby. they soon find that something isn't right here and fort mcmillan (ft. doom as the locals call it) is in some serious trouble. rather than go into the plot line i will make some comments about things i noticed about the movie. first off the acting is very flat, only a few of the people seem to be real enough to believe in. my first though was poor acting, but at the end i watched some of the outtakes and these same people became alive. so my only thought left is this is how the director wanted it. on top of the bad acting i have a great problem where the people don't react right to a given set of circumstances. take for example no one would take them to ft mcmillan for any price even though its only 15 miles away. yet when we arrive at the fort we find it is well maintained by a decent population of people, all of whom must get supplies from some one, not to mention mail etc. it is supposed to take place in 1867, yet we can see the railroad car has electric lights (they aren't on at least) and a locomotive engine that is at least 30 years later, not one of the general style of locomotives so popular at that time. there are also places where you can see paved blacktop, (and maybe a car at one point, didn't want to bother to go back and look) and other anachronistic items. if they had followed the rules of the "world" they made and let the actors be actors it might have gotten a 4 from me instead of the 2 i gave it, and they rewritten it about 4 more times it might have done even better.

the real plot...a group of post-civil war prostitutes seek alternative housing in fort boom. lacy everett and a close-knit family of call girls have been eating date expired sausages for days and plan to move into the former fort mcmillian. locals warn the women of eating more of the dated sausage. because there is a vicious pyromaniac loose in the area and he refuse to shuttle them out to the property. when they finally arrive at their destination, they discover their stomach is full of gass after all the bad sausage. it is not long before they learn why their new home is called fort boom.

charlie (george "norm" wendt) and rhonda ("just say" julie brown) are a pair of cheerful, murderous aliens who become stranded on earth and stumble upon a tiny western town. they become deputy sheriffs and dish out a deadly form of justice to speeders, murderers and others, while getting on the bad side of some of locals (led by wayne grace). meanwhile, their sexy alien daughter (anastasia sakelaris) arrives in a skimpy/shiny outfit with her black human husband (christopher m. brown) to find them and tv reporters and government agents turn up to fill up time.from what i can tell, this is a deliberate attempt to cover every possible genre (comedy, sci-fi, horror, western...) in one movie, and what a stupid, unfunny mess it is, despite energetic acting from the two stars. the script is downright atrocious.

one of the worst films of it's genre.the only bright spots were lee merriwether showing some of the sparkle she would later bring to the time tunnel and batman.a young patty duke also outshone the more established actors.

robert lansing plays a scientist experimenting with passing objects through solid matter, but he goes too far one night and unintentionally makes himself four-dimensional! atomic-age fantasy is rather charming in a very cheesy way. perhaps it was considered a thoughtful sci-fi in its time (with psychological overtones), yet seen today the film is mildly overbaked and naive; it's a camp-fest tailor-made for tv's late-late show. wooden performances by lansing and lee meriwether barely rate as one-dimensional, though patty duke (playing a cute brat pre-"miracle worker") gets a colorful, memorable exit. ** from ****

this is a very mediocre jackie chan film and one of his absolute worst james glickenhaus ruined it!. all the characters are decent i guess, but the story is so so, however jackie chan is still amazing in this even if he did look bored. jackie and danny aiello had zero chemistry together, and it was very boring a lot of times, however the finale was above average and managed to be fairly entertaining, and had some good stunts!. i have not yet seen the hong kong version, however i'm sure it's better then this dud, plus the twist is very predictable!. it's really lifeless and bland, and i don't blame jackie for not looking happy in this, and if he didn't star in this it would have been unbearable and completely unwatchable. the opening is supposed to be memorable, but it's nothing i haven't seen before and done better at that, and i thought the whole film was rather lazy and could have been an awesome film if jackie had control of it!, plus i really didn't root for any of the characters. this is a very mediocre jackie chan film, and one of his absolute worst james glickenhaus ruined it!, not recommended even for die hard jackie chan fans. the direction is terrible!. james glickenhaus does a terrible job here, with extremely bland camera work, bad angles, and keeping the film boring for the most part throughout. the acting is so so. jackie chan is amazing as always, however he is not his usual energetic self, and looks bored and ps*ed off throughout the film, had zero chemistry with danny aiello, and i really don't blame him either! (jackie rules!!!!!). danny aiello is ok here, as jackie's partner, but his character is a bit of an ass, and he had zero chemistry with jackie, he did ok i guess. roy chiao is decent as the main villain, but was just going through the motions and wasn't all that menacing, he still is damn cool though. rest of the cast are average at best. overall not worth your time or money. *1/2 out of 5

the protector. you hear the name. you think, "ah, it's a crappy hong kong movie." guess what - it's not hong kong. and yes, it is crappy. this amazingly stupid jackie chan film, ruined by us, yes us, the americans (i'm boiling with anger, ooh, i think i'll jump out that window!), has chan as a new york cop hunting down a gang, avenging the death of his buddy. sounds cool...but it's not. don't waste your money renting it. to prove he could make a better cop film, chan made the amazing police story (1985).

this movie suffers from the fact that for years hollywood had no clue as to how to package jackie chan for the masses. his low-budget hong kong movies were all fast-paced kinetic thrillers that highlight his amazing gymnastic skills and talent for light comedy. his early hollywood films stuck him in the same movies that were being packaged for stallone or chuck norris. there is nothing about chan's character in this movie that requires the character to be asian except for his being the star. in his hong kong films chan is never dull, with the movies being one rapid-fire martial arts sequence after another, but "the protector" is lifeless throughout. danny aiello isn't given much to work with either and the lacking chemistry between the two probably is more a result of the script and direction than how the two actors got on together. both have been better in worse movies. the best thing about the movie is the hong kong settings. the worst part is the appalling way that jackie chan comes off so colorless and drab. it wouldn't be until the made-in-canada "rumble in the bronx" that the west would finally figure out how to make a good jackie chan movie.

most critics have written devastating about that michalkov-movie, but i wanted it to see myself. and, unfortunately, they are right. the film had the greatest budget ever in russian movie history, two international stars, colorful mass scenes, apparently shot quite close to the kremlin - but in the end it appears to be a nice, sweet nothing. you would not believe, that this director earlier has made masterpieces like urga and burnt by the sun. the characters in the storyline are not convincing, neither jane nor mccracken nor andrej. only general radlov worth being mentioned. it remains on the surface all the time. politically it is to me a glorification of the army, and especially the russian one with values like honor and duty. and, having lived at least half a year in siberia: my russia is much more than the one that is depicted in michalkovs movie. regarding "burnt by the sun" by the same director as a no-question-10-points-movie, one of the best i ever seen in my entire life, i was totally disappointed by that one. sorry. nevertheless, michalkovs unique talent in delivering amazingly beautiful pictures is still there.

i saw this ego-centric "effort" at achieving a film of "epic" status in the company of several native russian family members. five people gave 5 different reactions, from mikhalkov worship to my cynicism.i saw a movie that looked like mikhalkov took a lot of "canal +" money, put some of it in his (and other's) pockets and turned the project over to a bunch of film students. i counted at least 4 different "styles" in the movie. there is no way that the same director is responsible for these different scenes. contrast these for yourself:·cadets polishing shoes with a dog.·train station scene (saying goodbye to andrei).·outdoor panorama shots.·ormond talking through the keyhole.·initial attempt on the grand duke and later chase scenes to get andrei back to sing in figaro.·fencing sequencejulia ormond is faster than superman. learning about his transfer belatedly, she gets all the way across moscow in one minute to say goodbye to andrei.the russian natives felt that the impression given of russian life was "caricature" and not history. they called it "tourist postcard" russia.they were all proud that a russian director/producer/fixer has managed to break into the "big time" and be able to waste over 30 million dollars of other people's money while maybe putting a little into local pockets during filming.if you want to "think" you have seen russia go see this movie. drink some coffee before you go.

this movie had the biggest advertising campaign any movie ever had in russia. "epic movie about russian culture", "great saga of russian spirit", endless articles and interviews. for me this movie was the biggest disappointment. the main character played by oleg menshikov is a stupid immature boy ready to set up his comrades because of a woman who doesn't even look like a lady. what is there to admire? in the first part of the movie the story doesn't develop at all. people's festival scenes look like boasting about russian audacity.i respect mr. mikhalkov for his previous works both as actor and director, but this movie just demonstrates his ambitions to be considered the "tzar" of russian cinema.

set in a post apocalyptic future, the new highlander is an effeminate little twerp named quentin macleod, who is being mentored by a new ramirez while his little sister tags along on their quest to thwart an evil immortal overlord. to do so, quentin must absorb all the knowledge of other immortals before this overlord, korton, does.in short, this is pure crap, much like the highlander sequels. quentin is a fairly stupid character, constantly whining and moaning and bitching in a "woe is me for i am a reluctant hero" kind of way, and he never catches on to the fact that he's an immortal and can't be killed, at least not easily. ramirez would have done better to ditch him and thwart korton himself.

if you are planning to schedule your program for a film festival, do not be misled by what it says in the booklet. this is a complete waste of time and energy. i have watched bunuel, i have seen dali, and admired them; but this isn't surrealism, this is not supposed to be at all. didn't they ever think about the reputation of human race while taking this picture? after we become extinct by global warming, these will be the remainings of our civilization. what if the aliens sample this as an example of our intellectual capital? with all due respect to the effort put in this, maybe it would be a good idea to terminate all the copies of this film - or whatever it is.

avida is a game of words mingling life and eagerness, but i personally think this movie was overblown by its ambition and does not make justice to its title. it gathers a set of awkward characters united by unbelievable links. furthermore, the way everything is connected at the end is, in my opinion, a bit pathetic. what remains of it was a set of images... an interesting one, but not enough to make this a good movie. i believe this film is supposed to be a comedy, but i surely didn't noticed! the nonsense and caricatural nature of the movie is actually the only good thing about it, but when it drags on an on and on it becomes no longer bearable. i have to say i fought hard to continue seeing it until the end, and i am still not sure it was worth it...

let me say at the outset that i'm not a very artistic person and that i don't "get" new art. that being said, this film is absolutely crazy, and in my opinion not crazy in a good way. filmed entirely in black and white with a series of very loosely connected stories, avida is a film for those who can look at modern art and say "wow, i feel the energy and passion of this painting." the only reason i give this film a 3 out of 10 is because i actually did manage to laugh at some parts, though mainly laughing at the sheer insanity of the film. two of the characters throwing chairs on a lawn, as to do what these characters were doing, i have no idea. i wouldn't recommend this film to anybody.

the abc gears up it's repertory company for another unrealistic representation of rural australia. yes folks, it's all there baca bourke (jeremy sims,an actor of little talent) fire hero , lill (libby tanner plays bronwyn craig in the bush), fifi (nadia townsend) town slut, preggers by baca's brother joe (i think). then there's uncle geoff the, big daddy of lost springs. uncle geoff's scenes are like tennessee williams on speed. only saving grace is russian actress natalia novikova as baca's loony missus. she is great. i can't understand why john waters took the gig as lilly's psychologist husband. must have needed the money i expect! still, he won't last long as lill and baca will be having it off toute suit. just watch this lemon to see how bad an aussie show can be. frankly, i'm ashamed.

i decided to hire out this movie along with a few other old horror movies.this was the worst,some of the killings were good and theres a bit of humour but i couldnt stand this,everytime a killing happened they would show scenes of all these old movies that the killer used to be in,i give this 2/10.

okay, so this was made way back in 1993. directed loosely by robert iscove and written loosely by john miglis, it's supposed to be based on a true story. hard to believe anyone could be so stupid and blind to the truth. for certainly it was obvious from the beginning that this dame was after all she could get.tim matheson, looking somewhat older than i remember him, played the empty headed man who was looking for romance in his somewhat dull and empty life. well, it came to him in the likes of tracy pollan, a somewhat vacant looking girl with kinky sex as her means of conquering her guys.come on, phone sex, even in the 90s was old hat. can't believe someone would fall for that old line. but mr. matheson seemed to buy it. and it cost him plenty. the hardest scene to take was when he finally threw the dame out of his apartment, putting all her junk in the hallway (in front of his apartment) and then had the stupidity not to change the locks. that's when i had enough of this trite movie. it made me want to wish the dame had tried it on me so i could have the satisfaction of telling her to take a hike.i give this chestnut a 1 out of 100. that's how bad i thought it was. i guess you can't blame the actors. but they were awful. did they actually try to play this with a straight face?

although a well produced made for television movie, dying to love you reeks with low grade melodramatic splendor.the film opens up to roger paulson (tim matheson, looking much older than i remember him to be), who is a struggling businessman that leads an empty, lonely life after his wife ruthie (who looks suspiciously like roseanne arnold) leaves him with the quickness. now all roger has is his cats....and his ad in the newspaper. once his ad is answered, he calls johnnie-elaine-lisa-oh it doesn't matter i'm whoever you want me to be-lawrence. then...they have phone sex.i'm not sure where you're from or when you were born, but i remember that phone-sex bit was played out by the late '80's. i'm sorry but that was trashy.soon roger and the broad hook up and have a whirlwind romance. they fall in love, visit the zoo to see gorillas, and then have some kinky sex with roger's son in the other room. she ties him to the bed and seduces him.roger is just so stupid that he does not realize that johnnie-eliane is just a bimbo that loves to sleep around. god forbid women only sleep with one man. soon enough, strange phone calls begin to occur, johnny girl wants roger to marry her with absolute quickness, and she keeps ranting and raving about her ex-husband who used to beat her. it's funny to see roger believe her through all this stuff. that's until a frumpy co-worker tells him to go snooping through her belongings like a nosy housewife. he takes her crappy advice and lo and behold, he finds a suitcase crawling with fake id cards and wigs and guns and a crossbow. he immediately takes the suitcase to the police and has her arrested. even though all this jazz, he still loves the dumb broad. she tells so much lies, it seems her tongue will catch fire if she tells the truth once.roger goes on with his life and meets an ugly woman named angela who looks like something off of gremlins 2. she has a child as well and roger takes quite a liking to her. but something inside roger's subconscious keeps him connected to lisa rohn (if that's even her real name) and he keeps going back to see her.now lisa is the "ex that won't go away" as she "earns" herself a get out of jail free card and shows up at roger's doorstep and his son matt is so busy trying to check her out, he pours juice all over the floor. il' rog is so stupid, he throws lisa out and doesn't even change the locks. boy, if all people were that stupid, i wouldn't even be writing this review. the ending of this movie is so corny, you won't believe.tim matheson is a made-for-tv-movie king. he just looks like such a dawm mummy in this movie. he's a little wooden and stiff. the dazzling tracy pollan works well with her role and her trampiness rings true. she is extremely beautiful and i do see what michael j. fox sees in her. this movie is great to watch when you're on that late night tip, but then again, you might fall asleep, considering how dull and bland it is.

this (allegedly) based-on-a-true story tv movie concerns a woman on the run from the fbi and a *seriously* stupid guy.first, we have roger paulson (tim matheson), a "regular guy" type with a mind-numbing job, an ex-wife, a kid he hardly ever gets to see and some cats.next, there is "elaine-lisa-you name it" (tracy pollan), a smart, sexy, good looking woman whose tongue would burst into flame if she ever told the truth.roger and lisa meet when she answers a lonely-hearts ad. roger is one of these poor saps who can't seem to handle living alone, so after his wife dumped him, he places his ad.it doesn't take long for roger to figure out that lisa is *not* a good person, but he has no idea how to get rid of her. he doesn't even have enough sense to change the locks on his apartment door after he throws her out.go ahead and watch this if you don't have anything else to do.

let's get one thing straight; this was bad! so putrid that it doesn't even qualify to be imprinted on anyone's memories.the ever repeating storyline (who's constant recycling of not only jokes but story lines and character appearances.) a typical storyline goes as follows; sue (the mother) opens the episode quoting on how she loves her baby son but smells awful (as if that doesn't get old! har-de-bloody-har!), some australian quasi-nationalist "bogan" -look it up- appears to say how she thinks she's awesome because she's an ozzie while everything/everyone else that isn't sucks before disappearing for the rest of the episode. (a small mercy)the rest of the plot revolves around the father (gary) getting in some kind of disagreement with sue and him talking to members of his band for advice on how to sort it out.the phrase "words fail me" is an old one but this is where it is the most truthful thing to say. it is so incredibly bad! so horrible, that i would like every trace of it's existence sent to the lowest depths of the north sea and life can go on.it saddens me though, to see someone as good as sally bretton (good actress, i like her) make a prat out of herself, ardal o hanlon (my hero aside) has the ability to be pretty funny - but not here - and ben elton, distinguished for so much good stuff somehow manages to come up with this...thing then comedy is in very serious trouble!

....and now i'm up to episode #7. i really was hoping it'd be over by now (not to mention canceled, once everything connected with the show -including the actors - had been dumped along with some toxic waste in the middle of the ocean somewhere, never to be seen again), because this series really is dire. to have this program listed under the genre of 'comedy' is at best misleading! it's so hard to believe ben elton could write something this bad, maybe this points to a lot of input from the other writers in everything he's been connected with before. in some episodes i haven't even laughed once!oh, and i can't believe ardal o'hanlon actually stopped doing 'my hero' & started doing this instead, his decision making skills were obviously impaired that day - perhaps he simply can't read, and didn't realise just how poor the scripts for 'blessed' were. don't get me wrong, 'my hero' is not masterpiece, but it's a million times better than this piece of junk.and just to annoy me even more i bet this gets a dvd release as well, when there are so many great tv series' that aren't getting released!

you might suspect that the plot of this movie was written in the process of filming. it begins as a "punks versus vigilante" movie, but in the middle of the film, the plot changes abruptly when the vigilante turns to be an honest man with his honest girl and his honest gym and has to fight the corrupt "businessmen" who want to turn the gym down at any cost to build a mall or something. then, the plot changes again, and we forget about the corrupt guys. the villain now is the friend of the leading man, who thinks he is a ninja. the guy becomes "crazy evil" and wants at any cost to win a martial arts contest. seeing this movie is like having a nightmare with the television on.

this is based on michael's life from 1983/4 till 2004. flex alexander did a good performance but looked nothing like michael. i feel michael was portrayed as a stupid person which i don't believe he was (even though he trusted the wrong people at times). i thought flex alexander looked chinese when they made michael look white. i think latoya should of been portrayed in this, she was always pictured with her brother in the 80's. i never thought any of the supporting cast looked like their counterparts. there were some things that were inaccurate lisa-marie presley's son looked about 4 in the wedding scene even though he was not yet 2 when lisa and michael got married. also when michael says to his mother katherine he thinks he and debbie should marry if she is carrying his child, it was katherine's idea for the two to get married.

where the hell did vh1 find the scriptwriter for this movie??? out of high school? this movie tries so hard to be sympathetic to michael jackson, but instead, turns him into a horrible, tacky caricature. all the lines are filled with clichés but surprisingly the acting wasn't bad. as usual, this is a bad movie with pretty good actors. the actor that plays michael jackson, jeez, i feel sorry for him! i think he did the best he could with the weak script. i didn't mind that flex did not look like michael jackson, i thought he did the best he could, but later on when he had all that white make-up on, oh man, did he look yucky! the other actors that played debbie rowe, priscilla presley and elizabeth taylor were pretty good. except that the actress that plays liz taylor looked too young and healthy to be playing liz. the actress that plays diana ross didn't look at all like her and i couldn't figure out who this woman was until much later on in the movie.this movie does a disservice to everyone who is on the side of michael jackson, or against michael jackson. it doesn't do anything to change anyone's opinion. as a matter of fact, the only opinion anyone will have after watching this movie is, oh god, this movie really, really sucks! and where the hell is michael jackson's wonderful music and songs? there are none to be found in this movie. i love the soundtrack to this movie anyway and i'll probably purchase it if i could.on the lighter side though, this is a very funny, campy movie! it's a great time waster if you want to watch something light that won't trouble your brain too much. i'll probably watch it again, because it just is so entertainingly bad!

this is absolutely the worst movie i have ever seen. i hope the real family and other portrayed characters have lawyers suing the hell out of vh1 for there portrayal. the acting is horrible, the writing is worse and the portrayal of characters is scary. its supposed to be a drama, but it was a comedy to me, you have no choice but to laugh at the bad acting. i usually like flex alexanders acting but this time he has completely missed the mark.you could argue he took this role for a couple of laughs himself, because it was so horrible. if you really want a dramatic movie for the night, do not choose this one. but if you are in for some laughs over bad acting and stupid writing, tune in. other than that, don't waste your time.

this should not have been made into a movie. everything about it was idiotic and i don't think i laughed even once. there were bits and pieces that were okay i guess but that's about it. a lot of parts were strikingly similar to a lot of other movies which did them a hell of a lot better. there were some famous actors/actresses in this but no one did a good job, they must've just not cared. this is one of those movies that tries to have a "cute" ending but it was so idiotic that it literally had no redeeming values. carrot top is probably the worst comedian out there right now. do yourself a favor and steer clear of this one!final decisions:movies : nooooo!purchase dvd : absolutely not!rental : only if you've seen everything else and have a free coupon but even then it's still not worth your while.

bad movie! bad! go stand in a discount bin. carrot top should really stick to low lit comedy clubs. it's movies like this that make old jerry lewis films look like shakespeare and john agar like john barrymore. coutney thorne-smith (a fine talent)is absolutely wasted. her purpose seems mainly to look pretty and oblivious. the only enjoyable things about the movie is seeing raquel welch doing an alexis carrington type role, and estelle harris as a harridan of a landlady. the only way i can imagine someone thinking it would be a good idea to make this (beyond sophomoric) film, is if the producers' fourth grade child was allowed to pick the script. well, maybe his third grader. what this film really needs is to be rubbed in the noses of its creators.

first and foremost this movie has the stupidest plot of any movie i have ever seen, and unfortunately i had to see this one. i was flipping through channels one day and stumbled upon this lousy excuse for a movie, and it confirmed what i have been saying for a long time. carrot top is not an actor, and is not funny in the slightest sense. he acts like he's a great comedian and thinks he commands the audiences attention. frankly he has the acting ability of a 10 year old class clown, scratch that less than a 10 year old's ability to compare them to carrot top would be a grave insult upon their good name. this movie tries to be funny using dull one liners which all seem to have been lifted from 50's cartoons. by the end i would have done anything to erase my memory of this movie, but sadly the memories stay with me. the only thing i can do is to warn others to never to watch this movie. however it proves the rumors true carrot top can't act worth a damn.

yes, the votes are in. this film may very well be the plan 9 from outer space for our generation. but whereas ed wood's film, for all its flaws, retains a certain charm despite it all, this film defines the word "charmless" to the nth degree. in fact, i'd suggest to the editors of the oxford english dictionary to cite this movie as a key example defining the that word in the next update to the dictionary.carrot top is a performer of such abysmal ability that normally rational people that i know once they hear his name become homicidal maniacs dedicated to wanting to kill mr. top as soon as possible. indeed, if one goes to amazon.com and look at customer reviews for carrot top's movie and other performance dvd, one will find several that could be construed as death threats to mr. top.one other curious fact about this film, i recall that mike nelson, the head writer for mst 3000, in his book mike's mega cheese about movies, good and bad, said he saw this film and shortly afterwords couldn't recall a thing about it, including the title. obviously mike was suffering a classic reaction to trauma. viewing this atrocity was so soul numbing, mike nelson had to block it from his mind. (evidently, in a later chapter in his book, mike nelson had recovered his memeory of this film. from the review he offers, mike nelson was definitely not grateful for the recovered memory.)the only comment i offer about the film, and it is not a spoiler, it's simply god's honest truth, it's not funny. none of it is, not even a nanosecond of it is funny.

this is without a doubt the most poorly thought out movie in history. the invention gags by carrot top are some of the most awful attempts to be funny in recorded history. i am not familiar with his other work, but if it is half as bad as this then i am just going to cry. i give this movie 1 out of 30 billion stars, and may god have mercy on the souls of those responsible.

masterpiece. carrot top blows the screen away. never has one movie captured the essence of the human spirit quite like "chairman of the board." 10/10... don't miss this instant classic.

"chairman of the board" is a ridiculously stupid film from the popular comic carrot top (also seen on the 1-800-collect commercials). he plays a surfing inventor who comes upon a man who has a flat tire. top helps him out and a few days later discovers the guy's died and has given his company to the comedian. even if someone else was in carrot top's role, it still would have been bad. the jokes (which are constantly rigged throughout) are terrible and the idea of a romantic "plot twist" should have been discarded. do not watch!!!

the humor is non-existent in this loser of a movie. carrot top plays a surfer dude inventor who consistently blows the rent money on his goofy, useless inventions. then he helps an old guy broken down by the side of the road, and voila, he's inherited a major corporation. and on and on and on past the jealous relatives, humanizing the corporation, hostile takeovers, the obligatory love interest.. aargh...let's just say this movie is virtually unwatchable. what carrot top has accomplished is to convince me never to go to his stage shows.

so i turned on hbo which i just got thinking that it would have some quality movies and i saw this. carrot top is so unfunny it's nauseating to watch. i've seen unfunny movies before but i think i find this one so impossible to watch because carrot top seems to think he's hilarious. watching this movie is really like watching a movie designed for 5 year olds with crazy, over the top overreactions replete with ultra stupid jokes that only a 4 year old would appreciate.what is amazing is how some other talented actors actually signed on for this project, such as larry miller and m emmet walsh. if you've ever seen carrot top's absolutely horrible mci commercials (or whatever they were) then this is more of the same, just worse. it's a slapstick fest that is a waste of a high budget that could have done something, saved homeless people... anything but this. i'm not sure it's in the bottom 50 of all time but for the $10 million spent it's a disgrace.

this movie is stupid. there's no getting around it. but so is dumb and dumber. mind you, dumb and dumber is significantly more funny than this. however, i for one love seeing stupid movies (tail sting) and laughing with a group of good friends over how bad it is. call me callous, but see this movie, and you'll find that the only way you can laugh at it is if you laugh at it instead of with it.

there are many mysteries in life. for example: why did any of the people other than carrot top agree to appear in this movie? why did anyone distribute this movie? why did anyone pay money to see it? i guess none of these questions will ever be answered, but one thing i know for sure, this movie is one of the worst ever made with a budget this big. it would already be bad, but the addition of carrot top's "humor" makes it even worse. the only entertainment one could possibly get from this movie is to burn it, smash it, or otherwise destroy it in an amusing fashion. if you were to rank it against every movie ever made, it would be right between "problem child" and "biodome". nuff said.

i think this movie was made backwards, first they shoot a whole lot of scenes and action, and explosions, and then the story-writers got to work trying to find a story to tie all scenes up together. this movie is without any doubt the worst movie i have ever seen, your average porn movie comes with a much better written and much more coherent script. the movie makes no sense. seriously, even if you are a segal fan there's no reason you should ever want to see this movie, except if you're one of those folks that like to stare at accidents, because this is a horrible accident, and should never have been released upon this world.boran.

lord have mercy! why was this film made? why did seagal and rising star max ryan agree to be in it? the foreigner is so excruciatingly bad in every conceivable way that it boggles the mind.the film has an ultra-cheap look to it. like a budget of a couple of bucks was far out of their reach. what's worse is that the makers know this and try to make it look slick to compensate. the result is a film that just don't look right. the fight scenes are so dull and edited 'discretely' to hide the fact that steven seagal is not in good shape anymore. none of them are engaging or exciting. the plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it. the eastern-europe locations (a sly move by the producers to keep the budget down, or non-existent) look unpleasant and should not be serving as the backdrop for an 'action' film (what action?).and what is the deal with the title? as far as i could tell everyone in the movie was foreign. which one does the title refer to?the dvd is in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen and in dolby 5.1 sound. neither are remarkable enough to warrant even a single rent. the foreigner is not worth one second of your time. gotta love that tagline tho! 'if they think they can stop him, they're dead wrong.' sheesh!

this movie simply does not work. the action scenes were shot to look stylish but just come out looking sloppy. seagal barely fights and a lot of his scenes are shot from the back ( if you look in some of the scenes it is not even him, but a 100 lb lighter stunt double) the movie is just all around bad!

three words: what a pile..... two words: don't bother! one word: sucked! there are zero reasons to see this movie. even those seagal groupies should shy away from this movie. the martial arts, the typical aikido, are horrible. the martial arts moves themselves are fine but the cinematography is pathetic. the movie actually goes into slow motion whenever seagal give his "kill move" to his victims. worse yet, is shows the same move three times in rapid succession from three slightly different angles. how stupid. seagal's acting was plain stupid, but i still give this movie a "6" for acting because of the supporting cast whose "villain" roles were actually quite entertaining.the plot is just dumb. seagal plays a federal express agent with a license to kill. his character also has that dedicated work ethic which means all of his packages get delivered to the correct people on time - at no extra charge - and nothing stands in his way. not assassins, political leaders, explosions, or even death.i expect a certain level of violence in a martial arts film, but there are several scenes in this movie of random and horrible acts of violence that lend itself in no way to the advancement of the movie or its story. there is a reason this movie went directly to video and there are tons of reasons to avoid it. no one should bother with this tripe.

there are films that are not released in theaters but on video. this one should be allowed to age and disintegrate the way old nitrate film stock does. no story, inept violence, over acted, badly written and the sorry thing is that the star was not the only bad part in the film. and i did like and enjoyed some of siegel's other movies.

seagal needs to get back to basics breaking bones and kicking butt. no more of this slow motion crap like foreigner and in the shadows fighting like half past dead. exit wounds showed more of his fighting skills with some wires which was ok but then he went back to b movie directors.

i am a fan of his ... this movie sucked really bad. even worse than ticker! & that movie was bad. it was kind of like they popped it out in a week. looked to be very low budget. only like 3 or 4 buildings used, a couple of locations maybe, & poor hummh! everything! it just blew.

i usually really enjoy steven seagal movies. they are usually highly entertaining and being somewhat of an adept of aikido, i usually like the way steven incorporates these martial art techniques in the fight sequences.however this film is a really bad movie making effort and it seems obvious to me that the blame lies with the director and the producers who obviously have no idea how to make an action movie, let alone direct someone like steven seagal and to take advantage of his knowledge and competence.i never saw the end of this movie. i walked out before the end simply because i couldn't stand watching anymore of this bad movie. i am sure that many people also share my feelings.

bad acting? yes, but it was not a surprise. stupid story? yes, so what?but why, tell me, mr director, why all that slow motion crap? fight scenes were bad, really bad, because of slow motion and bad cutting. not because of seagal."what if i just speed this up for 2 seconds and then slow down those next 5 seconds and then... maybe i need to flip the coin to decide?" what were you thinking, mr director???

one of the worst movies i have ever seen. seagal has been acting in several entertaining action movies, but this time this movie really sucks. just stupid killing and really stupid storyline. in addition, seagul looks fat and old.

first: i like s segal! but in this movie, he has hit rock bottom and started to dig!the plot what plot? very strange and unbeliveable plot.the actions way below segals standards!the good parts mr segal is a pro. and shows it. that's it.summary i could write (and have done so) a better script for mr segal. in case you read this stephen, mail me, i'll give you a better script to do a better movie! the only realistic part is the one where... (see spoiler part).spoiler part (stop reading here if you plan to see the movie!) - - - gas leak? wow. disecting a 'black-box'-recorder in a hotel room? i work in the industry, laughable! the bad guy 'get's away', that much is true in life!

imagine this...whenever two people meet in this movie, one of them is shot. the plot just does not exist - it appears that someone shot some action sequences and then tried to put them together to make a movie out of it. if you decide to watch it, you will regret it.

steven seagal's films of late have not exactly been good, but this is by far the worst since the patriot. the plot makes no sense what so ever; it is never clear in what the relationships between the characters are, who works for who or who is double crossing who. the film is completely disjointed, each scene seems to confuse the story further rather than carry it forward. even the action sequences are uninspired and hard to follow. most of the blame must lie at the director's feet for not even understanding the basics of film making, but seagal does not get off lightly, as one of the producers of this film, he must also share the blame. oh, and i haven't even mentioned how awful the acting is, even by seagal standards. even as straight to video fodder, this is not worth a view even for seagal fans. give it a wide berth!

i have to say that i really liked under siege and hard to kill.watching seagal doing his funny martial arts on people. i havebeen always looking forward to seagal-movies and, unfortunately, i was first disappointed by glimmer man, which i found really bad. the foreigner is probably one of the worst seagal has everacted in. horribly boring, badly edited, wrongest soundtrack and so on! dear reader, do yourself a favor an stay away from this!honestly: stay away!

i like steven seagal but i have not a clue what this movie was about. i am not easily lost with movies but i had no idea who was on who's side.hopefully some of his future movies will be a little better. my wife still thinks he looks good in black jeans, however. :p

can they possibly get any worse than this? probably. but after all steven seagal gets to do what he does. well kind of; this time instead of mortally wounding the bad guys he just wounds them. by reputation of being a bad ass agent seagal is hired to deliver a special package from france to america. but it is not an easy task with so many people trying to intercept and foul up the mission. the fights just don't have enough bite and the big bangs are just big and that's all. anna-louis plowman seems to be the only cast member not to appear wooden. also in the cast are: jeffery pierce, max ryan and harry van gorkum. don't put all the blame on seagal for this clunker.

they actually make a big deal out of a scene in which steven hurdles a 3 foot fence. the plot is...barely there, the acting (so to speak) is distressing and the action is catastrophically lame. this is the worst seagal film ever, and that is saying something.

since i'm from norway (one of the top ten (or so) richest countries in the world), it was much fun to watch how we use trucks from the 50ies and live in cottages from the medieval times. and since we have very strict laws when it comes to handguns, it was fun to see how much guns there actually were in norway during the five minutes of the shooting there. mr. direct-to-video even managed to bring his silencer on short notice, so he must have powerful friends in the customs.please do at least _some_ research before going to an "exotic" country, dudes -- you may hurt the feelings of old fans.sverre -- old fan with hurt feelings.

if i could have given this film 0/10 i would, and this is the first film i have wanted to rate so low. its worse than awful. if i went to see it in the cinema i would want the cinema to pay me for watching it (at least minimum wage). some of the camera shots were quite effective, but a lot were rubbish eg. villains reflection in a mirror that separates his head and shoulders side-ways from his body (seeing is believing). several totally pointless killings of innocent civilians. 2 murders that made me laugh out loud due to the victims actions/facial expressions when they were shot. i only watched it to the end (fast forwarding about 10 mins of the boring pointless dialogue) hoping to see seagal in some decent hand to hand combat, but there was almost none of that (should have known that when at the beginning he threw someone while going down an elevator and it was shown in slow motion with music - end of 'action' scene). in one scene we see seagal hand chop someones neck in slow motion which makes it obvious that his hand never even made contact). the chief villain keeps coming back to life. he gets shot in the chest on 2 separate occasions. the 1st time its with a shotgun which blows him out the 2nd/3rd floor onto the street. to sum up, this film is a total waste of time and a total joke. it looks very low budget (even for seagal). the colour is dull and grey. i could go on and on....just like this film, but i wont. watch this film if you've got insomnia. its guaranteed to put you to sleep.

i saw that "the foreigner" was ranked in the "bottom 100" movie listings here on imdb, so i wasn't expecting much when i tuned into it on the usa channel a week back, but i did have hopes. "belly of the beast" (which aired a month ago) was a mess, but it had great scenery and photography and some pretty cool moments scattered throughout, so i thought that this movie might have some of the same. alas, this movie fails the standards of basic watch-ability in almost every way. the screenplay comes off as the bastard offspring of a john lecarre novel and a richard ludlum movie, but done by people with none of those worthy writers' talent for plot and characterization. instead what we got is a glum, mean-spirited, nihilistic, cryptic mare's nest of muddled motives, tangled alliances and back-shootings. and chest shootings. and bombings. and eviscerations. this carries over to the directorial style, which relies on hackneyed 'grainy shot/slow motion' shots every 10 seconds, along with wire work and hyperactive jump cuts. these filmic devices that were stale 10 years ago when mtv directors used them for whitesnake videos, and the director works them like a punch press, hoping to inject some weird art-house techno thriller coolness into the proceedings. segal himself is just awful in this. he spends the entire film talking in a hoarse, throaty half-whisper and alternating between two expressions: looking like he is sucking on a lemon while someone waves a small turd under his nose, or looking constipated. and he's so chunky (and vain about it) that he never actually takes off his knee length duster on camera. i understand that it's hard to keep the girth under control as a male actor ages (although denzel washington and paul newman never seemed to have that problem). but you deal with it by being honest about it, and by growing as an actor, not by hiding it with carefully chosen camera angles and floor length robes. so i can't really tell what's going on, and the movie doesn't give me a reason to care about what's going on, and the protagonist is completely one dimensional and visually unappealing. not a recipe for a good movie experience. oddly, most of the set designs and scenery are atmospheric and striking; in fact, if you were to freeze the film on almost any given scene that wasn't a close-up of seagal, you would be struck by the care and professionalism of the lighting,colors, and composition and by how beautiful the eastern european settings are. but dressing up a rotten egg as a faberge egg can't make it edible. and the proceedings are rotten at heart. there are 'cool' movies (like "versus"), and there are visually striking but emotionally cold movies (like "underworld") and there are paranoia conspiracy thrillers (like "the bourne identity" and its remake with matt damon). and then there is this thing, which can't make up its mind what it wants to be, pretends to be all these things, and fails because it has no guts or soul. this is a movie made by professionals with an actual budget, so you can't really put it in the same class as "manos", "killer shrews" or "hobgoblins". but i'd rather watch all three of those movies back-to-back several times than watch "the foreigner" again even once.

don wilson stars as a cop who enjoys the occasional virtual reality fighting game, however things go wrong when the people behind the game decide to take virtual reality to a new level by making real people from the video game, okay actually they make the cybersex models as prototype but the main bad guy from the video game awakens and starts killing people and now the only man who can beat the guy is don wilson, who in the mean time falls in love with the cybersex model. actually with all things considered my biggest confusion was trying to understand if the people brought over from virtual reality land, were robots, human, cyborgs or just some type of unidentified computer program. it doesn't matter since this is all just an excuse to watch one of the worst actors ever butcher dialog as if he were running a deli. don wilson's complete lack of charisma is the film's biggest flaw since one just doesn't like the guy, he's too goody-goody, his voice is too high pitched and doesn't look very impressive in the action sequences. what saves this bore-fest from my lowest rating is athenia massey who looks super hot in high cut outfits and who gets occasionally naked. also on-board is loren avedon (a good martial artist), stella stevens and michael dorn as the main voice of the bad guy but their efforts are in vain as they are all concealed by the very bad acting of wilson. another flaw which is the film's biggest mistake is a lack of action, as we are asked to watch the story unfold but aside from massey's nudity and maybe some unintentional amusements due to laughably unconvincing acting, there really is nothing of interest. this also extends to the action sequences in which are flatly choreographed, badly directed and completely drained of all possible excitement. making this virtually unwatchable.* out of 4-(bad)

this movie has got to be the worse movie i have ever seen. i only watched about a half an hour and i just shut it off. the cars in this movie look like two geo metro's front ends smashed together. this movie isn't even good for laughs. the only time i laughed was when dante kept saying in funny voice, "nobody can beat dante, muhwa hwaa." i said holy god and shut it off. bad, bad movie. 2/10

this movie starts out with kids telling each other urban legends such as the poodle in the microwave and getting something extra at a chicken place. unfortunately, it then turns to your basic anthology movie. the first being about a janitor with a bit of a secret. this one is okay at best. then it gets worse as the next story about this kid obsessed with dead flies is on and it goes on and on and on. it is way to long and not all that interesting to begin with. after that you get the typical shock scene and it ends. you need more than this in an anthology movie. you need at least three stories and one shouldn't be so long it becomes dreadfully uninteresting especially considering you can see how it is going to end a mile away.

you gotta be a fan of the little man but i found burlesque on carmen dull, unimaginative and totally not funny.chaplin is retelling the story of carmen and plays a big role himself as don jose. it's a story about men and the women they love, although it's unclear why one would love such a woman as carmen, as she is playing the men against each other.as i said i didn't think much of it. chaplin made dozens and dozens of better movies so you can leave this one on the shelve.oh and i'm curious what the difference is between this movie and the 1915 version... or is it just an imdb mistake?on the whole: 3/10.

this is a awful re-make of a very good movie called "up in the air" starring frankie darrow, mantan moreland and marjorie reynolds. i was only able to get through about 20 minutes before turning it off. almost all the lines are identical, i have no idea why they would re-do the movie. i totally disagree with a previous post that dislikes the songs ( there the same also), in the original the singing is first rate, i'm not sure if marjorie reynolds actually did her own singing, it's hard to tell since the vocals were usually added later, and the songs are very good, surprising in a "b" movie. if you get the chance see the original it's available on dvd. you'll be pleasantly surprised.

this is a bottom of the barrel type of b-film from one of the poverty row studios, monogram, in the mid-'40s, the kind that filled out a double bill.only reason i watched was to see what jackie moran was like in a leading role as a page boy at a radio station who attempts to solve a murder. he played phil meade in gone with the wind only two years earlier and this was one of his last teen-aged roles. he's no mickey rooney.the script is as hapless as the production values and is full of cliché ridden situations with a cast of uniformly untalented individuals. wanda mckay is the switchboard girl who is "discovered" by a radio producer and sidney miller is the nerdy friend of the hero who's afraid of his own shadow.mercifully, it's over in an hour when the murder is solved after a round-up of all the suspects. terribly overacted, the only quiet performance of any interest is given by jon gilbreath as tex, the cowboy, but he bites the dust after too brief an appearance.there are several songs, but all of them are forgettable, as are the lame jokes and dialog.

i'll admit that this isn't a great film. it practically screams "low-budget" yet oddly i still found myself liking the film because although it lacked quality it abounded with energy. it was like the little engine that could and a movie merged into one! the film takes place at a radio network and concerns some of their low-level employees--two page boys (one very pushy and brash and the other one a wuss) as well as a new receptionist. all three have visions of radio stardom but must for now content themselves with their lowly jobs.into this story appears a murder that seems somewhat out of the blue. i didn't know that this was a murder mystery film and was taken a bit by surprise. however, like most b-mysteries, the cops are lamebrains and it's up to our pushy hero (moran) to try to save the day. throughout all this, i had a hard time deciding if moran was obnoxious or endearing. i'm still not sure!! there is a moment in the film that is high on the 'cringe factor' and that is when the two pages try out for the roles of radio comedians. they show up in black-face and do a 3rd or 4th rate imitation of amos n' andy. apart from being very insensitive, it also wasn't funny. fortunately the producer of the show they were trying out for seemed to feel the same way.overall. it's easy to skip this film and i wouldn't blame you if you do. however, the weird and frenetic pace of the film actually seemed to make up for the artistic deficiencies of the film and i am glad i saw it. a good film? no. but one that is still worth a peek for fans of old bs.by the way, perhaps i just don't have very good taste, but i thought both female singing divas really had poor voices despite how everyone in the film is captivated by their warblings. listen for yourself and let me know what you think. i just couldn't believe either was allowed to sing on film--even if it was just for lowly monogram studios.

two page boys working at a radio network go from trying to solve murders to performing in black-face in between work shifts. jack moran and sidney miller star in this whodunnit from 1945. lots of fast talking, everybody yells at everybody, and the two page boys call the police detective "marty" (played by ralph sanford). it's a real "shortie" at 59 minutes, and it has the feel of being adapted from a play, since it mostly takes place in a radio station soundstage. we don't really care about any of the characters, which is probably why its hardly ever shown. no big deal. this was phil karlson's second film as director. we're not given any clues as to who might be knocking people off, so we just kind of follow the police detective and the page boys as they all try to solve the mystery first. i'll say no more so as not to give away any spoilers.

yes. it takes a norwegian to ruin and slaughter two great books and a concept that would work well on film - this film truly is the worst swedish film of all time. i hated it so badly that i even considered walking out on it, something i have never done. but it was so awful i was almost compelling. i just had to sit through to the end. much like some early-80's stallone action reel, this one really takes swedish action back to the stone-age. so full of logical errors and stupid mistakes it is almost amusing - but who could ever see anything good in the terrible acting, mark hamill's surviving a mine-field or the dumb-ass, useless and irrational action?let me ask you: aren't we through with clocks ticking down to zero, the hero escaping in the nick of time and two friends become enemies reuniting by the end? stupid!!!!and one more thing: the product placement in this film is unbelievable. while other countries have understood that it shouldn't be so obvious, the swedish film industry apparently hasn't understood at all: just look at the credit card hamilton uses to open a window? or or or.... this film really makes me mad.

this is without doubt the worst film in the hamilton saga and the worst actor to do carl hamilton.peter stormare just cant pull it off,with his psychotic looks and no style at all.he may be good to do killers and psychotic maniacs like in "fargo" or "8mm" but in this type of roles,he is just useless.lena olin's presence did no use for this film.she couldnt save it from being what it is:an americanized copy of big budget action movies like "goldeneye","die hard 3","broken arrow" etc.this film has nothing swedish in it but the actors.its clear that some norweagian upstart director with mctiernan as model director has made this.mark hamill's presence is only laughable. 2 out of 10

this film just doesn't work. no two ways about it. i saw it for the first time back in '98 when it was released and i didn't like it. i just bought it on sale a couple of days ago, 'cause i thought "whatta hell, i'll give it a try". i don't regret for the money i put out for hamilton, but the fact remained the same.. this movie is pointless, dull and uninteresting.stormare is usually a delight, but that's when he's making films in the us. back home he doesn't do the trick. sure the movie is well made (if you forget the odd stock footage here'n'there), but in the end the only thing that really lifts hamilton above one star garbage, is hamill's turn as the bad guy hawkins. he seriously has fun with the character and is also responsible for the only two good moments in the movie.. "swedish intelligence, huh? now there's a contradiction in terms" and when he allows hamilton to have a word or two with his wife over the phone towards the end of the flick. and that's really pretty much it.** / *****

finally, i can connect the dots between return of the jedi and phantom menace. we see here where lucas lost touch with what made the original star wars films great and began to descend into the plot less tripe that ruined episodes 1-3. this film is more like one of those cheesy low-budget 80s swords and sorcerer films than anything worthy of being associated with the star wars saga. as with the jar-jar character, this seems targeted at children (and the toy market). the battle scenes are particularly bad. it was depressing to see sian phillips' incredible talent go to such a waste, after her classic performance in i, claudius.

i decided to watch this ultra-low budget film from the "poverty row" studio, prc, because it co-starred the exciting character actor, lionel atwillplus i really liked the title. even though atwill often played in these cheap movies, his excellent style of acting always made the films seem a lot better, as his screen persona was great (his real life is also quite interestingsort of like a bizarre soap opera). the reason i use the term "poverty row" is that this was a nickname given to the very cheapest and worst production companies of the era. many of these weren't even real studios, but production companies that rented space and sets from the major studios at night! yes, there is a good chance this was filmed after normal working hoursa common thing for such studios.the story begins with lionel atwill telling his friends a story about something that he was involved with years ago. a doctor falls in love with a lady but he's afraid to tell her about himself. that's because his job is putting people to death on death rownot exactly a glamor job! the doc asks his friend (atwill) for advice on how to break it to her, but regardless she won't have the man. later, you realize it's because her own parents were criminals.later, a man is killed and the lady is implicatedthough it's obvious to anyone with a brain that her sister was involved (and is a bit of a nut) and the evidence against the lady was poor. but, apparently the jury was filled with brainless people and she was convicted and sent to death row. even more brainless is that her old boyfriend was the man who was responsible for her execution. don't you think someone else might just be able to handle this case?! until this fateful hour, her friend (atwill) spends much of the film trying to prove her innocenceand prove that the flaky sister knows far more about the case than she'll admit.overall, the movie is only mildly interesting and a bit silly. while it is watchable and atwill is good (as usual), the rest of the film never really rises above the mundane and some of the acting is pretty shabby. it's sub-par and about what you'd expect from such a low-budget flickand nothing more despite the cool title.

lord, this sucked. there's a particular sort of sexual revolution flick from the 60s that manages to confuse sexual assault with sexual liberation. this film is an example. i lost track of how many times women are slapped, hit, whipped, or spanked in the film. and then there are all the times that women in the film fantasize about being slapped, hit, whipped or spanked (you know they want it, right?). sometimes it is ostensibly part of safe fetish play-acting. other times it plainly isn't, but you will wait in vain to see the heroine report to authorities that she has just been raped. instead we get to hear her being lectured by her rapist about her inability to "let go".every scene of this film reeks of misogyny (speaking as a straight, white, married man in his late 30's, not a teenage lesbian women's studies major with a chip on her shoulder, lest you get the wrong idea).perhaps the one good thing about this film is that it provides a stark reminder of just how bad things really were for women only a few short decades ago.

flipping through the tv and saw that the secret life of was on; gave george duran a shot at being the host. i know that jim o'connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him, but george was well dull. he really didn't seem to want to be hosting; his voice-overs were monotonous, didn't get involved with the guests. it seemed like he was interviewing guests for unwrapped, and he just happened to be in the shot. i don't know if george is going to get "better" hosting this show, i doubt it because he has hosted his own show now. the show did seem to pack more info in, but only because we saw less of the host. the formula of this show was very delicate, and i fear it has now been disrupted for good.

i saw the film many times, and every time i am more and more disappointed,which is shame because the films from ex yu are usually very good. the shame here is, that holiwood tried to make film about the place and people it has no idea. my self coming from the balkans(macedonia) found this film disappointing.simply that the bosnian characters are not really understood and not truly portrayed. to understand the mentality of a person from ex yu, you need to know their background, way of live, what makes them cry and laugh.and the director of the film didn't took that as guideline. when we(ex yu) make films, lots of symbolism is build in it, which makes the characters recognisable and likable, and mostly portraying the truth(if it is based on true story) the films like "pritty village, pretty flame", "tito and me', "underground',"no mans land', "before the rain","black cat, white cat","otac na sluzbenom putu",(when father was away on business),"ko to tamo peva"(who sings over there?)rare the masterpiece of the balkan cinematography,and nothing can compare to it. not the half baked story of and holiwood studio. as somebody from the panel mentioned the story jumps from one end of town to the other with no real connection. i am sorry but when the film is made is not only for the american armchair variety of viewers but for the rest of the world too, and some of them live on the balkans and sarajevo too. and to add insult to the injury, half of the things are shoot in bitola ,macedonia where i come from. imagen my shock when i saw the broad st. of bitola in the opening scene of the film, when the bride is shoot from the sniper.and what was that inserting real footage of the news covering in the film? anyway very disappointing, as the truth is far away from the film. shame that nobody consulted the real people how is to live in sarajevo under fire, before they shoot the film. book is one thing and real life is other, and this film lets down both.

how living the dream managed to get into the laemmle 5 in west hollywood is beyond me, as it is the worst film i have ever seen in my life. i should have known when the first scene opened in-gasp, eugene, oregon-,that this dud of a film with characters that you want to like and feel sorry for from their exclusion days from high school,but can't, as they are such losers, is so wooden and atrocious with dialog that is beyond bad.then, cliché, the three high school losers end up in la, and here is where the film could have been realistic if it had shown them trying to find a career in acting. but no, one works as a used car salesman, the other is a true loser in a garage call center selling magazines. even the bastard that runs the place has more audience appeal than that dreadful actor with the horrible foreign accent. and, they fraudulently get money from an insurance scam to set up an executive recruitment firm with no experience, just showing "the supposed good life" in la night spots with a cast of actors that are so wooden and bad, they better not have sag cards...i could go on and on about this bad film, but i ended up walking out of the theater, which had at the start six people, and when i left four men were the only ones in the audience. i wanted to like this film, but i couldn't find one merit in the story, characters, writing, dialog, nor the actors. whoever cast this film should retire. amen...enough...

this movie is a real low budget production, yet i will not say anything more on that as it already has been covered. i give this movie a low rating for the story alone, but i met the director the night i saw the film and he gave me an additional reason to dislike the movie. he asked me how i enjoyed it and i told him that it was not easy to like. my main objection was the lack of foundation for the relationship between the two main characters, i was never convinced that they were close. i also told him that the scene where the main characters were presented as children becoming friends was too late in the film.he told me that the flashback scenes were not in the original script. that they were added because he felt like i did that the two main characters did not appear close. he went on to explain that these scenes were not filmed to his satisfaction as they were out of money. i agree that they did not do much for the film.another fact about the movie, that i was not aware of, is the actor who had the lead wrote the script based on his own personal experience. this is usually a bad move as some writers do not take into consideration the emotional reaction the viewer. the story is so close to home that the writer make too many assumption as to the audience's reaction to his own tragedy. and the story is tragic. however, it did not work for me as i never cared for any of the characters, least of all the lead. what was presented were two evil people out to make a buck by any means, regardless who gets hurt. when ms. young's character decides to give up he evil ways, it appears that she does so because she is ineffective, not because she knows she is doing wrong. if the movie has a message then i suspect that only the writer is aware of it.

jeez, this was immensely boring. the leading man (christian schoyen) has got to be the worst actor i have ever seen. and another thing, if the character in the movie moved to america when he was ten or something and had been living here for over 20 years, he would speak a lot better english than what he pulls of here. or to say it in my own language "skikkelig gebrokkent". but it is cool to see norwegian dudes in a movie made in hollywood. it was just a damn shame they were talentless hacks. the storyline itself is below mediocre. i have a suspicion that christian schoyen did this movie just to live the dream, as he clearly does in the film by humping one beautiful babe after another.

there have been many movies, on living the american dream. and this is one of them.first of all, on the technical side, there is a lot wrong. the audio is bad, i had trouble understanding the dialogs here and there, and the camera positions could have been better.they really tried to come up with a good movie, but for example the part where they show, how jonathan is loosing himself in the dream,with girls, drugs and alcohol, is done very badly. the acting is very poor as well from all the characters in the movie.i had a hard time watching it from the beginning till end, and couldn't wait for the movie to be over.if your expectations are low, and you're bored on a sunday with bad weather, watch it. if you in for a deep story with action, then this is not your movie.normally i would not have give a score of 1, but of 4.5 for this movie. but the reason i gave it a 1 is because of the bad audio, and camera uses, not to mention the bad cut scenes with cheesy effects.

the first question is: how many talentless idiots it takes to screw a movie up? answer: one is more than enough, if he writes the screenplay and directs it. the second question is: did anyone teach the actors to handle guns properly? answer: hell no. i wonder if kristy swanson got hit across the face with hot brass - because it damn seemed so! the third question is: how many times we did the "super secret government agency conspiracy gets uncovered from inside" plot? answer: a good couple too many! the fourth question is: are michael madsen and ron perlman overrated? answer: in this movie, sadly, yes. the fifth question is: can a pair of boobs save this movie? answer: even three (kristy swanson's pair and the director/writer) didn't.god... if i see the (most probably) assassin getting her guns ready for a hit, and then the morons from prop department give her a completely different set the first bloody thing in the goddamn movie, the "suck" meter hits the peak. time from beginning of the movie to me switching the tv off: fifteen minutes. just a little bit more than it took me in case of "alone in the dark".

please give this one a miss.kristy swanson and the rest of the cast rendered terrible performances. the show is flat, flat, flat.i don't know how michael madison could have allowed this one on his plate. he almost seemed to know this wasn't going to work out and his performance was quite lacklustre, so all you madison fans give this a miss.

i was a still photographer working in europe the summer that jim salter shot the movie three.i did some swell pictures for him, one of which i was told became the poster for the movie. i didn't see the film until years later. i thought it was bad. a pity, because the elements that went into it were compelling. robie porter's girlfriend was almast as beautiful as rampling herself. salter asked if i would stick around and be an extra cameraman so they wouldn't have to shoot everything twice. i said sure, but i had to return to ny, promising i'd be back. alas, i never did get back. one of life's unsung melodies.i wish i could post the pictures i made somewhere.rowland scherman

shirley temple's films for twentieth century fox aren't negligible because they're poorly-made (darryl f. zanuck supervised most of them, after all); they don't retain much of a "classic" stature among cinema aficionados mainly because they're weighed down with the syrupy optimism of depression-era hollywood. 1930s audiences were placated by the delight of seeing a dimply, often orphaned sunshine girl making the grown-ups look foolish by comparison (they fretted and wrung their hands while she danced her troubles away). seen these many years later, temple's vehicles barely get by on story (aided always by musical sequences to bolster the content), and her timing (always too-perfect) and exaggerated reactions might leave most modern viewers rolling their eyes. no one could possibly be blamed for their exasperation over temple's performance here (shouting lines at the top of her lungs) or the perverseness of her dance steps, sashaying with a crowd of sailors to "at the codfish ball". still, the fantasy aspect of this particular story, previously filmed in 1924 from the book by laura e. richard, is enough to captivate those in the proper saccharine spirit. seems shirl was pulled from a shipwreck by a government-appointed lighthouse keeper, but when a truant officer from the state board finds out the tyke isn't in school, she threatens to take the kid away. it doesn't really matter if the prune-faced officer has a point that temple isn't being raised properly (the woman is turned into the proverbial villainess almost immediately); one can see right away that temple can hold her own, taking care of herself and her elderly guardian in the bargain (as well as the local widow who has her hooks in for the captain). temple isn't the only one overly-rehearsed; guy kibbee's january is cued for wide-eyed reactions so often you wonder if maybe if he didn't film them all in one day. the dialogue is steeped in waterfront metaphors ("you can't rush a trout!" ... "well, don't give up the ship!), and something about the whole enterprise seems strangely pixilated. ** from ****

in my opinion, this movie is not good. i hardly find a good thing to say about it, but still i would like to explain, before i conclude it is just another bad movie.i decided to watch it because costas mandylor is starring in it, and that was the main reason i watched it till the end. i like action movies, and i understand that such movies are built on the action rather than the story. i know they don't go into details when it comes to the credibility of the story and the events, but even that does not explain why some scenes, just because they lack the sense of reality, look ridiculous.at the beginning, the movie looks quite promising: a tough, good looking specialist and his not so tough but smart and funny partner must do a job, which turns out a bit different than they expected. the story takes place on a cruise ship. a disaster happens, the ship is turned over, and only a few are left alive. during their struggle to survive they have to escape a shark, a professional killer and the rising water.furthermore, the movie is quite violent. the main weapon (beside the disaster which already took out most of the passengers) is the gun, which is successfully used in many cases. i personally missed a good man to man (or woman to woman if you prefer) fight. family fun? i don't think so.all in all, i think this movie was shot in a hurry, without a real vision what it is trying to say. made of the usual action movie tricks, with a bit of something called love, and without a real meaning, it just results in a bad movie.

this is by far the worst british comedy ever, how it made it past the first episode let alone the pilot is beyond me. the acting is weak from the main character played by ben miller to sarah alexander (from the fantastic coupling)right through the cast. the plot/story lines were unfunny and very very predictable using many worn out ideas. a very painful series to endure but sadly put in a slot between two excellent shows. describing it as britain's answer to ' meet the parents' does a disservice to 'meet the parents' and is as about as fresh as an old shoe that has a run around with the family dog. britain should have learned that rip offs from other countries never work from looking at america's sad attempts at doing so.

trekkies is really not a movie about star trek fandom. it's a freak show about those star trek fans who have no sense of reality. as a freak show, it's fine. but it is a mistake to think that this movie gives you an insight into star trek fans. most star trek fans cringe at what this movie shows.

this owes a great deal to the plot of captains courageous. although he is quite grown up, it is partly the story of a wealthy lad who is shanghaied as a crew member aboard a cargo vessel and becomes a man in the process. moran of the title is a boyish young woman also brought up on a vessel owned by her father. when the cargo burns, she and crew members are evacuated to our lad's ship. however, the captain has smuggling on his mind and his intentions are not honorable where moran is concerned. the inevitable ensues - our lad falls for the mannish moran and she for him. in the end evil is subdued and the lovers are united. some interesting dialogue points out that moran belongs to no man -"and no woman." (a nod to sappho here). dorothy dalton is appropriately sexless as moran and not too attractive either. valentino does well in a romantic, action role. his sexy build and physique are shown off to advantage and the role is quite a masculine one. he is very appealing. this is no great film but it passes the time. what it really showcases is valentino's beauty and sexiness.

this movie was nothing like the book. everything was mixed up or changed. most of the movie was things that weren't even in the book.this movie never should have been viewed. it was a great disappointment to me when i enjoyed the book so much and then to watch how this movie trashed the entire thing.i would never recommend this movie to anyone that is a fan of nora roberts or j.d. robb.honestly this movie is not worth watching with how off from the book is really is.

'carolina moon' is an adequate made-for-tv movie about a girl with psychic powers who returns to the town whereshe grew up in and where her childhood best friend was murdered. turns out that every year on the same date anotheryoung girl is murdered and tori, played by claire forlani, must solve the mystery before she ends up dead. claire forlani (meet joe black, csi new york) is the female lead and does a pretty good job of it, ably supported by the rather delicious oliver hudsom and a still luminous jacqueline bisset. the script, adapted from a nora roberts novel, is bog-standard and the plotis tediously predictable. that, however, is offset again by, like i said, the rather delicious oliver hudson.

i don't leave imdb comments about films but this.... this film was bad. very bad. i fast forwarded through most of it, stopping where i hoped the acting had improved since the last scene, only to continue with the fast forwards. formula plot -- once the obvious murderers were discounted, there was only the one left. and that was in the first five minutes. scene by scene it felt as though i'd already read the script before because there were no surprises, no mystery. the tori character... bad bad acting. a true waste of time on dvd and a definite 'let's go to bed early' option if it's the only thing on television. if you watch this film, you will find yourself realising you'll never be able to get back the time you've just wasted.

a total and absolute waste of time. bad acting. bad story. predictable. simple. pathetic. after a while i was only watching to see what happens, since i'd already invested my time into it. totally surprised mrs forlani played in a weak movie as this. honestly - just don't bother. a total and absolute waste of time. bad acting. bad story. predictable. simple. pathetic. after a while i was only watching to see what happens, since i'd already invested my time into it. totally surprised mrs forlani played in a weak movie as this. honestly - just don't bother. a total and absolute waste of time. bad acting. bad story. predictable. simple. pathetic. after a while i was only watching to see what happens, since i'd already invested my time into it. totally surprised mrs forlani played in a weak movie as this. honestly - just don't bother.

the story is about a psychic woman, tory, who returns to her hometown and begins reliving her traumatic childhood past (the death of her childhood friend and abusive father). tory discovers that her friend was just the first in a string of murders that are still occurring. can her psychic powers help solve the crimes and stop the continuing murders? you really don't need to find out because, oh my god! this was so so so so bad! i know all the nora roberts fans will flock to this movie and give it tons of 10's. then the rest of us will see an imdb score of 6 and actually think this movie is worth watching. but do not be fooled. the ending was predictable, the acting terrible (don't even get me started about the southern accents *y'all*) and the story was trite. just remember....you were warned!

first, let me state that i have no idea who nora roberts is. so the book may have been great, but the movie isn't.i have spent my entire life living in the peidmont region of nc. i have never heard southern accents as ridiculous as the ones in this movie. i have lived in two small nc towns and charlotte and raleigh. on occasion, you will meet people with a strong southern accent, but i have never encountered a town where everyone talks like a bad imitation of gone with the wind.in response to gore_won from the atheist community. your comments reveal more about your warped psyche than it does about the movie. if we were to stretch our imaginations and pretend that there is anything realistic in this movie - which there isn't - then the truth is that bad people such as tory's father will always find some justification for their actions. the author chose religion as a counter to tory's supernatural abilities. your supposition that "the true character of the gospels" directs a man to beat his daughter is about the most perverse and misinformed interpretation i have ever heard. before you start spouting off about the gospels, maybe you should read them first.back to the movie. the dialog is flat, unnatural, and unbelievable most of the time. in particular, many of the things that kade said to tory are inappropriate and do not match the mood, context, or way they are said.the "exciting twist" at the end of the movie is lame, predictable, and lacks any credibility. some have also claimed that jacqueline bisset does a wonderful job in this movie, but the truth is that the bitter mother character is also a stale, predictable, one-dimensional character. is that bisset's fault? i don't know.if you have a choice between watching this movie and a twenty year old rerun of the muppet show, i recommend the muppet show.

i watched this movie for the hot guy--and even he sucked! he was the worst one--well, okay, i have to give props to that freaky police officer rapist guy too, he was even worse. the guy wasn't that cute in the end, he had the most terrible accent, and he was the most definite definition of hicksville idiot that can't stand up to his mom for the one he "loves" there's ever been. overall, and if this makes any sense to you, when i go to pick up movies at the video store, i think to myself as i read the back of a movie that looks so/so, "well, at least it can't be worse than carolina moon." the most terrible movie, and the most terrible writing, acting, plot--everything in it made my gag reflexes want to do back flips. it was the most horrid movie i will ever see, with gabriela way up there too. i hated it, and trust me, if there was any number under 1 imdb had for rating, i'd choose that in a heartbeat.

i read a lot of high hopes from readers of the book that this would be a faithful adaptation of nora roberts' story. not having read the book, i don't know if this adaptation was faithful but i do know it wasn't good. actually, the screenplay was the best part of the movie so kudos to nora roberts.i planned ahead and watched carolina moon because of claire forlani. i've never been sure if she's a good actress. she's been decent in some movies, average in others and really bad in this one. but, forlani wasn't alone. the performances were all over the place. oliver hudson was wooden and boring. josie davis was hammy. then, amidst all this b-rate acting, there's jacqueline bisset! she didn't have a lot to do other than portray bitterness but, even sleepwalking through that, she was miles ahead of the others.still, forlani remains one of the most breathtaking women in movies and i was not disappointed in that capacity here. i believe forlani can be more than eye-candy but, until she turns in a good performance in a good movie, she continues to excel at that. and, i'll continue to faithfully watch everything she participates in. fandom is fun that way.this movie though, carolina moon, was pretty bad. in addition to the bad acting (fake southern accents are really distracting) the direction was pedestrian. it wasn't horrible. it was just the boring made-for-tv caliber you're used to seeing on lifetime.if you're a fan of any of the stars you can probably enjoy carolina moon for that reason, as i did. if you're a fan of the book you might enjoy seeing the story on the screen, albeit in a lackluster form. otherwise, this movie is unremarkable.

this fantasy was utter garbage. i thought michael moore cornered the market on ridiculous anti-government movies, but this one was far worse than anything he ever did. no wonder critics of the british media complain it's driven by tabloid journalism. this movie is a left-wing loony's greatest fantasy come to life on the big screen. anyone even slightly to the right of such rabid bush-bashers should be appalled it ever got funding to be made. i'm sure it will do well in syria, iran, pakistan, and north korea, though. it's hard to believe that in these days of insane muslims blowing up innocent commuters there is anyone in the u.k. who thinks britain should surrender in the war on terrorism. i guess it's no longer the country i admired for standing alone against the nazis nearly 70 years ago. all hail neville chamberlain and the pathetic policy of appeasement!

the film begins in latvia just after wwi. being a history teacher, i knew that multinational troops occupied much of russia during this time. there was serious concern about the spread of bolshevism and the troops were there ostensibly to protect their nations' interests. however, some times they flew missions or had armed conflicts with the communist army, as the nations involved really wanted to see the so-called "whites" win. however, the whites were deeply factionalized--some wanting the return of a czar, some wanting a republic and some wanting something in between. because of these mixed goals and a lack of a real commitment by the foreign armies, the whole expedition was doomed and left the ussr after only a year or two. however, what i did not know was that german troops were also involved. this surprised me, as they had just lost wwi and weren't in the best shape to be mounting such an expedition.this is the backdrop for the film, but it's also about a pro-communist rich lady and her ill-fated love for a childhood friend who is among the german troops. she throws herself at him repeatedly but in each case he rebuffs her. so, she then sublimates these desires by various affairs. while none of this sex is all that graphic, this and the underlying reason the man isn't interested make this a rather adult film and one i wouldn't show to younger audiences.while the setting for this film is interesting, the overall film is as gray and lifeless as any i have seen. i don't recommend it unless you are an amazingly patient person or you are really into overrated german films. i especially warn away anyone who suffers with depression, as it will no doubt make it worse. the simple fact is that there are so many better german films out there waiting to be seen--such as mostly martha, das boot, mother kusters goes to heaven, wings of desire or ali, fear eats the soul (among others).

leonard can write lyrics, but he sure can't sing. nor has he had an original idea in his life, just a floater. from the looks of this nasty little puff piece (note that his publishers, mcclelland and stewart were involved in the production), he didn't know how to live, either. the woman he loves is only mentioned in passing and no woman is allowed to speak in this nonsensical advertisement. while irving layton was given a credit, the other poet interviewed, earle birney, was to remain nameless. i come from the generation just after cohen, where all the boys seemed to idolize him. his lack of commitment was probably just calling to them. i hadn't realized what a disappointing poseur he was back then. i was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt because of his age.whiny, little rich prince, and not one memorable line in his oeuvre. no dedication to social change, outside of the sexual arena.you don't speak for my generation, lennie, and not for my gender. go back to the monastery and stay off the screen.as for my local public broadcaster, i will let them know what i think of them wasting my time on this guy. not a has-been, a never was...

naach would have won an razzie for the worst film in 2004 (may be overall too) if it were global. when it comes acting badly (aka showing attitude/yawning/over (not) acting) halle berry is no match for antra malli. while the catwoman had storeline, supposedly hot actress in microscopic costume, and some action sequences, naach had nothing at all.one of those movies which makes me wonder why imdb does allow one to rate a movie as 0/10. yet again, i think that movie does not even deserve a 0. it has to be something negative or minus infinity.ok what about the plot outline? it is a funda-giving, arrogant, full of attitude choreographer meet an useless, skill-less, loafer who aspires to be an actor tale. the story is so short that if just another sentence, imdb might ban me for writing a spoiler. about the story-telling? its like a bunch (sorry 2 people for the most part) of people moving in super slow motion. don't try this movie if you have bought new dvd-player. you would end up believing that either dvd is in bad shape or dvd-player is struck. not its fault at all.at the end of it all, you end up giving some credits to the director. at least he realized that both antra malli and abhishek bachan (at least at that time) can't speak dialogues convincingly, so there are not too many dialogues in this movie. so, you can at least sleep your way through the movie, with some annoying noises from those antra-malli song sequences.do watch this movie if you are new to bollywood cinema. once you have tolerated this movie, you would be able to see any bollywood movie and enjoy it.there can't be worse 3 hour torture than this!

ram gopal verma usually makes so-so cookie cutter formula fare, lifted from some hollywood flick. his every film after shiva is in the cookie-cutter genre. occasionally, he makes a truly horrible movie like this one. for the first 55 minutes, we are introduced to the only 2 characters, a struggling gymnast masquerading as a skilled dancer (go figure!) and a wannabe actor trying to strike it rich in bollywood. they fall in love, zero becomes hero, dancer/gymnast gets no break, gymnastics, angst, the usual heartbreak, more gymnastics, angst, song, dance, angst, some more gymnastics, more ridiculous gymnastics and before you know it, you're fast asleep. and this despite the hot sexy hot hot sexy hot bod of the leading lady-cum-gymnast-cum-dancer.but hey, you're not alone!! the editor, director, photographer, in fact the whole cast and crew are asleep thru-out the entire production. only difference being they got paid to snooze while you paid money for this crap, so you lose. ha, joke's on you. don't feel sorry for yourself but for our poor broke gal as she tones up daily in her high-rise penthouse in the sexiest of leotards and exercise-wear. puh-leese, when will the poor thang get a break, she's starr-vinnng?!antara mali cannot act. rgv's lost his marbles. abhishek tried hard but failed. no plot. no story. nothing. she must've paid rgv handsomely to make this all-nonsense stuff in addition to free gymnastics lessons on his casting couch. what a super deal. no need for an acting career.such absolute rubbish can only be "made in bollywood" of course!

in most parts a lethally dull venture, naach is about this dancer/choreographer (antara mali) who regards herself as some kind of auteur, beyond the petty commercial compromises that people around her, including her actor beau (abhishek bachchan) build their careers on. nice idea, only it turns out that she has the most howlariously bad concepts about costumes and dance movements, stuff rotten enough to make even the forces behind those ultra-cheap south indian potboilers squirm in severe embarrassment.the story follows a yawn-inducing predictable pattern...dancer and beau meet and have an affair (yes, sex included)...beau gets success, but she spurns his attempts to help her...beau throws attitude and they walk out on each other...dancer meets a most unlikely director who wants her 'to do what she wants'...incongruous effort bags even more incongruous popularity...beau's attempts to reach out are rebuffed until a climax where he bursts out about how he can't live without her...d-uh end.actually i didn't really expect this film to be much good. so why did i watch it? because i have an antara mali fetish. she's an actress with imo sufficient talent to reach grand heights provided she has the opportunity. alas, her role in the film looks far better on paper than in actual execution, ironic for a film that's supposed to be about an uncompromising character. to give her credit she puts in a game effort, shining well in the few scenes that actually ask of her as an actress. i just wish the movie had been more worthy of her. abhishek bachchan also throws in a few good punches, the last scene salvaged somewhat by a simmering turn which pleasantly reminds you of his father.only recommended if you can sit through humongous piles of dogcrap for the return of a few grains of good moments courtesy the lead actors.

naach a more detailed review can be obtained anywhere else in the web. this one is a good portrayal, although i do not agree with it entirely. taran is a commercial guy and hence views from his angle only.ram gopal varma (rgv, seems like a political party) has created a marvel in rangeela, so this one seems like a pale reflection of that one in some parts... i'm not even going to compare urmila and anthara.. both are good! the former has better acting talent, although the latter is catching up nicely.anyways, i like anthara's character. she is true to her art, not touched by any unnecessary emotion and definitely not too practical. she is a dance scientist, actually she is so sure of her theories that even comparing her to a scientist would offend her. hey.. donald trump.. maybe you gotta ditch melania, here is anthara and you've already built a taj mahal... ain't this easy? abhishek on the other hand is a practical fellow, who wants money, power, fame, etc. hence these two albeit were struggling to get a break into the film industry, cannot get along, given their different styles and approach to life. this is very typical, but what i like about the movie is that it says what an abhimaan would say in its total runtime, in one scene! what's new? this movie takes a different angle to the film industry and how different people get into it. there is always something different about rgv's movies, this one is different too, it is way too slow for his standards. in parts, it drags one almost to sleep.noticeable it is tough to notice anything other than anthara in the first half of the movie. i think this skin show was necessary for the dance sequences involved :-) also, looks like anthara is a pro in yoga, she is way too flexible, almost like a prabhu devi. aby baby is improving as an actor with every movie. i am sure his filmstar blood is paying off rich dividends. the title song was really good, the music overall was above average.

mount godwin-austin (otherwise known as k2) is the world's second highest mountain, and if the evidence presented in this film is to be believed is the hardest mountain to climb successfully without getting yourself killed. "k2" is basically a buddy flick set in the breathtakingly dangerous world of mountaineering. while the outdoor photography takes in some truly awesome scenery, the characters standing in front of all those glorious landscapes are a crashing bore - and therein lies the fault with the whole film.cocksure lawyer taylor brooks (michael biehn) and his quiet married friend harold jamieson (matt craven) spend their free time rock climbing. during one of their trips, they meet up with another bunch of climbers funded by wealthy mountain enthusiast philip claibourne (raymond j. barry). claibourne's team are in training for a forthcoming shot at the infamous k2, a mountain that taylor and harold would both love to tackle but could never afford to do so. during their training run, however, two of claibourne's team get themselves killed in an avalanche. taylor and harold put themselves forward as potential replacements. despite initial reluctance, claibourne gives them the nod of approval and the pair find themselves joining his team in the himalayas. harold's wife cindy (julia nickson-soul) is distraught that her husband is going to take on such a dangerous climb, especially since he has recently become a father. tensions in the climbing team mount as taylor repeatedly clashes with another member of the group, the equally brash and arrogant dallas woolf (luca bercovici). meanwhile, claibourne himself grows increasingly ill as altitude sickness takes its toll on his body. will the guys reach the peak of k2, or is their quest destined to end in disappointment, or even death?"k2" spends an inordinately long time introducing its somewhat dislikeable characters. biehn as a foul-mouthed, pushy, adventurous type is especially hard to like, as is barry as the hard-nosed mountaineering millionaire. but on the other side of the coin, craven is so dull that it becomes difficult to believe his wife could possibly give a damn about him going off to climb k2 - heck, she'd be better off if he never came back!! rounding off the main characters is bercovici, whose characterisation as dallas woolf is as campy and over-the-top as every other role he's ever played. the story itself is totally tame and disposable  just a straightforward yarn about guys trying to reach the top of a mountain. there's a bit of male bonding thrown in, but the whole subplot about harold and his wife amounts to nil, and the personality clashes between taylor and dallas ring totally false. "k2" scores its few merits solely from the stunning cinematography by gabriel berastain  during the himalayan sequences, the scale and awe of the mountains is quite nicely captured. i'm completely with critic kim newman on this one, who hilariously stated in empire magazine: "on this evidence, climbing k2 can't be any harder than sitting through it!" quite true, kim, quite true!

i can't believe the amount of reviewers who praise this as realistic. i'm a million miles from being an expert, and i'm never going to climb a mountain; but even the very basic knowledge attained from reading into thin air, and watching everest beyond the limit and a few other everest docs meant that this film just got more and more ridiculous as it went on. there is some good climbing footage at the start; and when the billionaire mission leader asks early in the film "how much experience above 8000 metres do you have?", i was encouraged to hope that this might be a gritty and accurate man-vs-nature odyssey. instead you have a bunch of climbers zooming up a mountain with no acclimatisation; climbing with goggles off in full sun, and they are barely ever out of breath performing miraculous feats of endurance. only near the summit is a little fatigue suggested, to dramatically accentuate the physical feat of climbing such a monstrous peak, almost as an afterthought. if you have no knowledge of mountaineering, give it a look: be prepared for some clichéd heroics (although no more clichéd than a hundred other passably diverting flicks), and a clichéd outcome. i've been developing a minor fascination with high mountains and was looking forward to watching k2; but other than some amazingly beautiful scenery, it was a let down because it was so far removed from reality. i can imagine some experts being employed in the making of this movie, but then being conveniently ignored in the pursuit of the heroic, and sadly fantastical storyline. also, you would sound like a bit of a tit if you said "welcome to the death zone" at 200000 feet.

seems like a pretty innocent choice at first- the name "employee of the month" might ring bells with "office space," and the show "office clerk." i think not. this isn't even a dark comedy. the director of this movie, whoever the guy's name, was a complete jerk, and has a sick, perverse mind. there is no pleasure in being lured into feeling sorry for a complete loser who cheats on his wife, steals from his top-notch job, and lies through his teeth 24/7. the second i walk in to the room when my family are watching it (and believe me, they were only watching it more because they were praying that there would be at least some relief, perhaps even some fable in the end, sending a warm message of good justice done and when the good guys look good). all the good guys were killed so long ago that they had no time to look good. no memorial was made.this movie has borderline insanity. it disrespects the elderly, the dead and women- and the director tries to make people to like it.i gave this movie a two only because the soundtrack was good. but not even that was all that memorable. if you were lucky enough to not see this in theaters, definitaly my friends- do not do this at home.

this is a crummy film, a pretender to a genre of surprise ending movies. and a genre that has been done so much better before. the plot limps along, with a predictable ending. (yawn) the characters are unlikeable, and some are so unlikeable they are almost unwatchable. matt dillon, a fine, intense actor is totally miscast here and is stiff and mannered. the others are forgettable. much of the dialog is sophomoric, again a pretender trying to be witty. i wouldn't hire the screenwriter to write my grocery list. yes, it's that bad, veering from misogynistic to just plain gross, as in beyond frat-house gross. with so much real talent out there, i'm really surprised this movie ever got made. it shows the total lack of imagination of the office suits...

this is the worst exercise in middle class pretentiousness yet to hit our television screens. i unfortunately did not see it when it was first shown but paid for the joy of watching six hours of excruciating drivel - and i'm still waiting for the laughs to arrive. i love tasmin greig having been a big fan of both black books and green wing and therefore know that she is capable of the very best of comedy parts. however, she played this part as well as she was able considering the lack of any decent comedy material provided. please broadcasters bear in mind that the trades descriptions act may well be invoked if you continue to bill as comedy material which is at best pseudo psychological romanticism and at worst a drama which poses as a quirky comedy to hide the fact that is neither fish nor fowl.

if you live in the suburbs, are relatively well off financially, and do not really have much contact with the city life of england, then this is the comedy for you. not something a mass audience would go for, but if you're like these characters they show you'll love it to pieces. overall this is a comedy that the snobs at the bbc will sit back and laugh at for their pleasure and only a select few of the publics. comparing it to bbc comedys like only fools and horses, fawlty towers, black adder, and other classics, this series tends to drift away from the bbc's regular product to the audience and deliver to somewhat of a folk culture.

... why watch a tv drama (billed as a comedy) in which none of the characters are likable or even interesting people ? i can sort of see what the writer david renwick was trying to achieve: the misdirections and bad-taste surprises that he put into "one foot in the grave", etc. i admit that the script made a bit more of an effort than most on british tv at the moment. but really ... who cares about these people ? they are cold bores.another poster mentioned the scene in which the woman sits down to watch a video of herself and her deceased ex-boyfriend shagging. that was the moment when i switched off this programme, never to return.p.s. it's interesting to note that the posters who didn't like this series are all british, whereas those who praise it are mostly in other countries. this reflects the fact that when the bbc broadcast this series it was ignored by viewers and sank like a stone.p.p.s. good news for those who liked it ! there will be a second series in autumn 2007 - though without the male lead. it sounds like the bbc have decided to turn it into a more conventional 30 minute sitcom.

this film tries to skewer the studio era in hollywood and the morals of the 1950s. guy stone is intended to be a rock hudson type, but both the script and actor matt letscher end up channeling a smarmy, cruel, baritone-voiced version of george hamilton instead, which makes for an unpleasant character.guy stone is such a reprehensible human being that the audience has trouble liking this waste of human skin. unlike hudson, who was sweetly promiscuous, stone is a hateful person who knowingly uses and then throws away the sweet, handsome young men who share his bed every few hours.veronica cartwright is jerry, stone's celibate lesbian manager. cartwright is very good, but the director doesn't quite know what to do with her. the fault lies in the dialogue, which is a bit clumsy, and the film suffers for it.carrie preston's sally owes more to ellen greene in "the little shop of horrors". as written, preston's sally is good for a laugh but little else. newcomer adam greer is lost in this movie. he cannot act, and seems to have been cast for his hot body and good looks.like many recent films, "straight-jacket" is a "dramedy" -- a comedy film which switches messily to a drama about two-thirds of the way through the film. and, like almost all dramedies, "straight-jacket" fails miserably.despite the expensive services of skywalker sound, the sound quality of the film leaves a lot of be desired. the over-use of the musical soundtrack creates a distracting amount of cues as well.the film really doesn't managed to satirize anything about the 1950s. unlike "singin' in the rain," which perfectly captures hollywood's ambivalence about the advent of sound as well as the studio mentality about formula films, "straight-jacket" doesn't manage to depict hollywood in the 1950s at all well. the dialogue, sets and behavior of the key characters are nondescript rather than dead-on stereotypes of the 1950s hollywood. the same can be said for the lampooning of the general mores, social trends and fads of the 1950s as a whole. compare the transformation of guy's home to the dead-on satire of the 1950s home in "little shop of horrors". there is no comparison; "little shop" hits the nail on the head, while "straight-jacket" doesn't even know there is a nail.motivations, too, seem haphazard. rick foster is supposed to be a principled liberal, yet he falls almost immediately for a materialistic schmuck like guy stone. rick is fine with guy's closeted status for many months. but when it comes time to go to italy, he becomes conflicted for reasons that are completely unclear. and even though sally appears to fall in love with freddie during the party, this plot point simply disappears a few minutes later without comment. rick comes off like a gay man from the 1990s, not a gay author of the 1950s. indeed, modern morality suffuses this film -- which it shouldn't, if it were really a satirical look at homophobia in 1950s hollywood.plot holes in this ragtag film also abound. saul repeatedly says that he's going to turn freddie stevens over to the feds, but never does so -- allowing freddie to out guy. jerry and saul's plot to "in" guy never makes any sense, nor does sally's sudden decision to take the blame. and although guy has admitted he is a homosexual, apparently it doesn't matter and he ends up a famous star and playwright anyway.unfortunately, none of the production values manage to save this film. the cinematography by michael pinkey is pedestrian. at times, the film almost looks like a filmed play rather than a motion picture (especially the scenes in saul's office). everything is restricted to medium shots, and the film has an incredibly static. the editing by chris conlee doesn't do the film any help, either. long scenes which would benefit from the insertion of close-ups or shifts in point of view remain uncut. whether this is due to lack of coverage or bad editing is not clear, but the overall effect is to create a sense of lethargy.the film relies heavily on cgi effects of guy's home, created by visual effect designer thomas dickens. but the cgi looks clumsy and hokey, and it is very noticeably amateurish.my overall impression of this film is that the jokes are cheap and easy, the plot muddled, the characterizations wildly inconsistent and way off the mark, the satire nonexistent, the performances overbroad and off the mark, and the comic timing off. it's almost an amateurish film. it is as if someone took a high school production and threw $10 million at it.

director and playwright richard day adapted his own stage material for the screen, clearly inspired by rock hudson's real-life dilemma from the 1950s: what to do with a screen idol who is secretly homosexual? marry him off to an unsuspecting woman in order to quell the gossips (and keep him working). wispy-thin idea given some energy by the good cast and retro production design which amusingly resembles a greeting card by shag. the dialogue isn't very clever, and there's some slapstick goofing around near the beginning which fails to work (spitting out food, etc.). still, when a serious tone comes over the final act, it is handled with great taste--and is far more welcomed by the viewer than all the klutzy silliness. matt letscher does good work as movie hero/male whore guy stone, but are his experiences here enough to strengthen his character, or would he be right back at the bar the next night? the movie seems not to know--or care. day wants to get off a few one-liners and one carefully written pro-gay speech--a plea for tolerance--but he has no other agenda. for audiences who invest their time and interest in these people, the sentimental bow on this thing can look like nothing more than a prank. *1/2 from ****

when king kong stripped her of her top in the 1976 remake, i was breathless. i don't know how many times i went back to see that movies hoping to see more. jessica lange was not a great actress then (she became one), but she was so hot! i went to see "sweet dreams" when it came out because, by that time, ms. lange had become a great actress. it looked like a wonderful story. and she's always exciting to see.i never walked out of a movie faster. my wife concurred.when we got into the car, i turned to her, and said, "if you had told me i would get bored watching jessica lange take her clothes off, i would have said your crazy. i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off!" how bad is that?

a potentially good idea gets completely let down by a weak script which throws all credibility out the window leaving the actors very little to work with. roth covers it up as best he can by being all mouth; hurt has about as much menace as a fluffy bunny and stamp can't seem to decide whether he's playing an ex-london crook or some toff straight off the playing fields at eton. as for poor laura del sol she does what she can but her character is no more than every northern european's idea of the stereotypical latino woman who's all pouts and hot temperament. if you're a fan of any of the main actors don't disappoint yourself or fool yourself (as i suspect many of the other reviewer's here have done). watch it by all means but stay critical; you know these guys can do better.

this film holds 7.0 rating on imdb, so even i sensed something rotten in it's synopsis i decided to try it out. what a waste of 100 minutes. first of all, the 80's were not a good decade for crime and thriller genre. most of these, in those days were badly done with silly plot (if they had any), so there are very few that can stand out, and even if they were good they are still not very good. the hit, however suffers from everything that made silly crime pictures silly. it has poor character development, improbable plot and wasn't written or directed in a decent manner, and when you have such shortcomings the acting doesn't help. stephen frears often tried to emulate french new wave in english style film making and the two don't match.first of all terence stamp is 10 years in hiding because he testified against some of his former partners in crime. he hides in spain, of all places. he is finally caught up with, and than first kidnapped by a group of silly looking spanish thugs, just do be driven away some distance to the two hit man that are supposed to deal with him. these two are john hurt, who is supposed to be hard boiled, stone cold killer, and tim roth (in his first role) as the devil's apprentice. they don't kill stamp right away, they first dispose of the "three amigos", they shouldn't have hired in the first place, and then, they are driving stamp to paris, because one of the buddies he testified against wants to confront him. ok that's possible. but even with stamp being such a dangerous figure that they had to hire four guys to overpower him, they don't tie him down, don't incapacitate him in any way, and drive around with him, like he's one of the buddies. stamp doesn't object and is happily going to paris to be shot, not using any of a half a dozen chances, these "professionals" offer for him to escape. than it appears that tim roth is just a school boy bully, making the idea of big crime boss teaming him up with a hard core hit man like john hurt, even more improbable, especially on an important job like that. but than john hurt is not so hard core himself, he spends twenty minutes of the movie, killing or not killing the totally surplus australian, played by bill hunter, whose only purpose in this film is to introduce the lovely laura del sol, his mistress (who he says is 15, but she looks more like 25), and whose role in the story and acting capabilities suggest that she was offered the role, solely on the basis of being the director's or producer's mistress at the time. after much deliberation, hurt kills the australian but takes along his mistress for no apparent reason. than he wants to kill her but roth with his "subtle ways" convince him not to, so even she kicks him, bites him and scratches him through the entire movie, he stays true to that deeply buried human side of him.than you have plain idiotic scenes, like when hurt and roth lock the car from the outside, trying to prevent the people inside from getting out?!?! anyway the movie drags on. tim roth falls asleep, guarding terence stamp with his gun on his chest, and stamp just waits there watching the waterfall. than the whole shamble of a plot comes to the point where everything we've seen in the last hour and 20 minutes just goes out through the window. let's recapitulate, the whole point in not killing stamp right away (except for having a movie) is to take him to paris, so his former partner is to have a last word with him. and the whole point in him not running away is that he is prepared to die, saying "it's just a moment. we're here. then we're not here. we're somewhere else... maybe. and it's as natural as breathing. why should we be scared?" but my friends, here is where the plot twists, hurt kills the man while still in spain, and we ask why bother and drive around for days, he could have done it in the first 15 minutes, and than contrary to his philosophy stamp is very afraid of being killed, so we ask again why didn't he run, and he had plenty chance. roth gets killed too, but he shouldn't be in the movie at all, and del sol, well she's promised a role in this film purely for romantic (read sexual) reasons, so she stays alive again, even she attacked hurt for the 15th time in the movie. he killed all the others, but not her, she must have maximum screen appearance. the movie was made on a shoe string budget and it shows, but when you have no story and card board characterizations, it shows even more.and yes fernando ray appears and goes through the movie as the guest star, having a single audible line of dialog. awful

laughed my ass off but probably because i was stoned. that aside ... this is in no way a horror movie, there is no horror whatsoever in this entire movie and the plot holes are so huge that even a below average iq person would think it was stupid. on top of that, i am living in denmark and have been for all my life and can assure you that denmark is way too small a country that you need gpss and maps to find your way back if you got lost. i would estimate that unless you really put an effort into it you could never be farther away from town or other people than maximum 3 hours on foot. secondly i don't think any part of the movie, apart from two shots from copenhagen where none of the actors were in, were actually taped in denmark. the bog woman is talking swedish not danish. the helmet on the first bog body is brand new. the girl they find in the forest is hiding under a type of rock that does not exist in denmark. this is just stupid.

********spoiler alert************** wasted 85 minutes of my life watching this "film". first of all, we think it is hilarious that the producer cameoed in the film as the autopsy doctor with a horrible unbelieveably unbelievable accent -- what the hell was that anyway, romanian? and how is it that in denmark no one speaks danish except the bog creatures? (note, the scottish camp director...). ? and who does the shopping for the bog creatures? their pants looked like they were purchased at banana republic. very nicely dressed for being 1200 years old. this one was worse than scarecrow slayer (we didn't think that was even possible). we basically fast forwarded through 75% of the movie looking for any gore/death/scary moments. none found. do rent the dvd just to watch the 2 hour "behind the scenes of bog creatures" featurette. who are these people? are they serious? and the filmmakers are like 60 years old. i think this is their holy grail and that's pathetic enough in and of itself.best line from the movie, hands down: "not bad for a girl who never even went to graduate school...." my blind grandma who has alzheimers could make a better movie.

i saw this movie yesterday on a public service channel. they had advertised it as an awful movie, and so i was drawn to see it, and i was not let down.a group of 18-19 year old go to an excavation site at an old viking castle in denmark, to try to uncover the myth of the berserker vikings. strange things happens: something is in the forest, and people start disappearing.the main thing about this movie that really bothers me, is that the story is supposed to take place in denmark, where i happen to live. there were so many places in the movie where the hollywood-style overlapped danish reality. it really made the acting and drama look ridiculous in my eyes.you never see the characters interact with any of their surroundings. its feels like a mini-hollywood in denmark, and it takes away the credibility of the movie. when at one point you hear someone speak "old danish", it sounds exactly like modern day swedish. really bad research, considering the director is from denmark.the characters in the movie used gps and maps, and that's really funny, since denmark is about the size of your backyard. nomatter where you are, there is never more than 50 km to the sea, and 500 meters to civilization. and if you are at a castle, there are going to be tourists everywhere. we see a lot of overviews of forests in the movie, and sometimes, we see what appears to be north american vegetation(?) the story did not exactly appeal to me, maybe because the acting was so bad. when the characters see the bog creatures for the first time, they are not even scared. i guess their acting skills were insufficient to display realistic emotions. at the end, there is an unexpected twist, but it didn't impress me, since i didn't really care.the bog creatures are cheap, but they had the potential to be scary. unfortunately, they fail, since we get a good look at them standing in the forest when the characters arrive at the castle. also, there are no really scary scenes, since the bog creatures are mostly just standing around.anyway, conclusion: disregarding the facts, the movie is your typical b-horror flick. i guess people from other countries can enjoy it more. as long as you are unaware of reality, it doesn't matter. just like i think of usa as one big action movie set, everyone else can think of denmark as a forest with a castle.. and some living-dead people in a bog..

bog creatures shows exactly what can happen when very enthusiastic people get together with a little cash, some knowledge of movie making, a mixed bag of aspiring actors, and a lot of determination, yet all without the necessary knowledge and skills to pull off anything more than a fairly poor looking after school special (in a bad way, not a nostalgic good way). i mean this is so-so quality home movie / student film stuff if you want to pass it around to family and friends for free. thankfully, i found it in a discount bin somewhere. sure, there may be some sort of market out there for this kind of thing, but it is a market that seems to only exist by default because there are so many poor b movies out there. even more so now in this day and age.the only people i would recommend this move to is aspiring guerrilla filmmakers. first, i would recommend that they watch the special feature making of thing included on the disc. see the film crews enthusiasm, their hard work, joy, and very high opinions of their own product. then watch the movie. within a few frames you will hopefully understand what went wrong. bored, i went through the whole thing and clearly the director and cinematographer tried, but just don't know enough about what they are doing. they knew enough to have fun, but in the long run, without necessary skills, this interprets to: they knew enough to be dangerous. this is like a bad nickelodeon movie (as apposed to a more decent one i guess). a couple of the actors did ok, and the cool stoner looking dude with the tattoo (real or fake tattoo i know not) was probably the best and most natural and i hope he makes it. but their natural acting talent was what was coming through despite the bad movie, bad script, and so-so directing principles. if the director had spent more time helping these aspiring actors to develop their characters, studying successfully proven camera techniques and lighting principles to direct his crew better, and if the script had been actually worked on instead of written in a week or so (according to the very indulgent documentary) then maybe this could have been more of a film. instead, it's a film that has a feeling of some potential, and has a few moments in it (due more to the genre than the film itself), but ends up showing nearly every frame, what not to do. if you want to see what a decent low budget horror movie can really look like, watch phantasm or even laserblast. if you want a glorified home movie (no joke), get bog creatures.

although many billie dove fans are delighted with her work here, i have to pass. as a socially prominent member of the british smart set, her british accent is basically non-existent and her line readings sound just like, well, line readings and her emoting seems trance-like and ponderous. basil rathbone, usually a fine actor, seems off-kilter throughout and also speaks with a weird sort-of-accent - in his case something like italian, though we cannot be sure. the script manages to keep his precise ethnicity a secret. he is further hampered by the script which gives him one of those old movie diseases, something to do with nerves, which requires surgery. the only real entertainment is provided by the illustrious kay francis sporting a lacquered bob with side curls in her role as a depraved countess who shamelessly devours men, including rathbone, and then spits them out. she pulls it off with her unique aplomb. she is the only living thing in this dead sea of a film.

an unintentionally hilarious early talkie melodrama with kay francis as the countess balakireff chasing everything in pants. at the beginning of the film she "throws back" the stableboy for being too young before setting off for the chauffeur! the high-toned english set she moves in is such a clichéd bunch of harummpf-ers that it's ridiculous. but the topper is basil rathbone as an italian violinist with a chico marx accent! "my violeen! how weel i ever play eet again!" "patreecia, my meelk is cold!" it's campy beyond belief.

all right, let me start by saying i love the original rs for the 64. the graphics were new, the ships were really fast and cool. the missions were a challenge, but you had a strategy to come up with. the computer didn't tell you every step of your mission, you could wander and explore. that's the first thing that's wrong with rl, everything you do is under a timetable and controlled by other people. i mean, shouldn't you, as the leader, be telling people how to handle each and every mission? and speaking of missions, why do they intersperse the original trilogy with completely made up crap? never mind.i was so waiting for this game when i heard they were going to allow you fly through the asteroid field from empire strikes back. i think anyone who is a fan of the films wanted to do this. so, they give it to you. it's the stupidest level in the game. you start by flying through the asteroid field with ties chasing after you, and your whole objective is to get farther into the field while shooting the ties. you have to kill them all to get ahead. hey, remember how many han killed when he was in the field? none, they all had poor piloting skills compared to him. i just wanted to be able to dodge the asteroids as they came at me, but instead i have to use my automatic aim guns to kill ties behind me.that was the biggest disappointment, you have no control over your flying, everything is sluggish. all except for the a-wing, probably the fastest and most maneuverable ship in the entire fleet. but, oh yeah, didn't han say the falcon was? anyway...you finally get to the battle of endor. here is the ultimate level, you get to destroy the death star, everyone's first instinct is to pick the falcon and be the leader. but, of course, you get there and have to do stupid pre-chosen strategies like finding (not to mention deciphering the difference between) the tie-bombers. this is impossible in the falcon, by the time you have spotted one group the frigate gets destroyed. the only way to get passed this part is to pick the a-wing. after this you have to attack the star destroyers and that's a real stupid chore. this game makes you feel like you're the only one defending the rebel alliance.after you frustratingly get through that 'fun' fight, you get to the death star. and here, you might think 'yay! i get to destroy the death star', and again, like in the asteroid field, you have to do some tedious thing while narrowly getting passed the tunnels of impending doom. your mission is to protect the ship in front of you, remember that from the return of the jedi? it's so moronic because if you pick the falcon, you'll die because you're not maneuverable enough, but if you pick the x-wing, you have to keep locking and unlocking your s-foils. so it's a choice to either kill the bad guys, or try to catch up to lando, who apparently doesn't know how to maneuver. thus dying in the process.the bonus stages aren't even worth aiming for as each level just gets more and more frustrating. it makes me feel the way i did when i saw the new three films, upset and in need of killing something. lucky for me, smash bros melee exists.i hope with the wii they come up with something a lot better and have the original trilogy levels to full capacity. i'm going to sell this game the first chance i get.

i am a lover of bad movies. i own "r.o.t.o.r." and "boa vs. python" and am working to build up my collection to such great titles as "troll 2" and "what's up superdoc?" but "storm trooper" is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies. it's just lame. the guy who said he's had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right. everything about this movie is stupid. when the robot guy runs into the car it seems almost as if he knew it was going to blow up, there was just no reason he would ever run in that direction. "judge, jury, and executioner," "the perfect cop...but they went too far," i mean, come on, why do people bother making these movies anymore? r.o.t.o.r. makes it because it is hysterically awful, but storm trooper is just a waste of cinema because it isn't even bad enough to be so bad it's worth watching. this belongs in someone's home movies collection, something they can be sort of proud of, but that is all. i am p*ssed off it was on an hbo channel (with only 1-star, which is why i watched it) because it didn't belong there. even if you love bad movies, do not watch this movie. it is shameful.

anyone who thinks kool moe dee, carol alt, and corey feldman comprise a list of good actors must be smoking something i'd love to try sometime. where to begin: lousy soundtrack, hammy acting, "action" in places. this is the typical amateurishly written hack fodder that washed-up has-been and never-was's love to star in. i actually felt embarrassed for the "stars" in this "film". the only thespian missing to top this turd was gary coleman, who if he would have been in the movie, would have made it at least somewhat howlingly bad, rather than just plain bad.there was one part in the film where carol alt screamed, "do you think i'm an idiot?!?" yes, carol, i do, your agent does, and please for the love of all that is decent and holy... go away and stop degrading yourself like this! this film is something anna nicole smith would take part in.i would tell you what the plot was, but that would be one more sentence fragment to this article, plus my mind drifted many times during the movie anyway, so i barely paid attention.

i think this is the worst movie i have seen since "mortal kombat 2". the action (including the effects) is like in a cheap glen a. larson tv show, the acting is terrible and the dialogs are even more stupid than in mk2. avoid at all cost.

normally for movie reviews, i try to be constructive and objective, but there is only one word for this, uh, "film" : sucks!!!!!!! the dialogue, acting, special effects, plot, set, and characters all seem as if they were made up by, well, my potted plants. don't see this, for the sake of all that is good and right in this world! :)

alright! a sci-fi/horror/action b-hybrid directed by jim wynorski and in the final scenes we get to see a cyborg with a defleshed metal head killing off multiple people! as with any wynorski-flick, he throws in a whole bunch of crazy ideas and subplots that mostly don't lead to anywhere. but "storm trooper" is more like a two-movies-for-the-price-of-one kind of deal. on the one hand we got the drama/thriller part (as such the film opens) with carol alt killing her incredibly annoying & ungrateful husband (a plot that simply leads to nowhere). and on the other hand we got the 'escaped cyborg on a rampage' part, "night of the living dead"-style. with carol and the cyborg being the ones trapped inside the house and a bunch of special ops/bounty hunters playing the role of the zombies, trying to break into the house. needless to say this flick is not up there with the greatest. zach galligan (of "gremlins"-fame) especially is painfully bad and corey feldman (in a small supporting roll) is once again completely wasted on this movie. wynorski even rips off one of his own movies here, since i am 99% sure he used some stock footage of his previous film "976 evil ii" (the scene with the exploding truck and the motorcycle). yes, it's so not good and so much fun. this is strictly for wynorski-fans only. and i am one of them, in case you didn't know already.

wow, this movie sucked.this movie was a embarrassment to the original sandlot.everything about this movie was awful.the acting was horrendous. every part except the part of the 'mexican' sandlot manager was terrible.luke perry, though only bit parts was absolutely awful. this was is worst role ever. even the kid actor playing him as a kid was someone you'd want to punch, even in the end, lol.this movie reminded me of those kid movies that go that extra mile making a part goofy way beyond the funny stage. the humor was for 6 year olds.if your over 12 and want something worthwhile to watch, skip this movie and watch a sitcom instead.

the calu-what now? yeah, i thought it was a stupid name as well. chris carter remains blissfully unaware of the scum in his writing staff. starting off with the usual cheery x-files teaser (a baby getting run over by a train) this episode... well i can't really say it goes downhill because to be honest it was never going uphill. poorly written, with us feeling no pathos for any of the characters (except maybe that baby at the start) the writer makes us hate characters before brutally killing them off, it's the worst technique ever. are we supposed to feel sorry for the characters of hate them? don't ask me. not only is it boring and un-scary, but it's like watching a really bad omen sequel with overblown and disgusting death sequences and rotten special effects (although to be brutally honest, that's the least of my worries). sara b. charno began her x-files career with a whimper and thankfully ended it with one as well.verdict: in the words of my maths teacher mr. laverack: "horrible, awful..."

i admit - i was lured to this one from the hype - and i didn't stop to consider the sources. "one of the best indie exploitation flicks of the year (1999)", shocking", and " a must have ".well - i wasted my money. but not all was bad in this movie. they at least got the gore right, as well as some of the most unique methods of murder seen in a long time. there is even a storyline (kinda) and that is about it.but for an exploitation film there is a surprising amount of content - but no exploiting. we get gay sex - sorta. we have 3 inter-racial babes - maybe. we have a psychotic vietnamese hooker - nice back, oral sex (ok that made me wince) and some female version of gene simmons (i don't get that part). we have an honest to goodness capone - rates among the best of the actors in this film - that is not a compliment. and finally we have a government conspiracy thrown in to - i don't know - try to connect the vengeance/random/theme killing by jimmy boy to make the vietnamese psycho seem sane??????? if nothing else this movie proves that the italians and the americans do not have a lock on this type of movie. the latinos can make crap as well as the rest of them. kudos goes to anyone involved in this accomplishment that overcame it and made a career for themselves.

i don't think it really matters too much what the plot of this movie is about, the main thing you'll notice is the extreme amateurishness of the entire production. the acting is what you'd get if you chose people at random off the street. the sound is really annoying - a medicine cabinet closes with all the gusto of a gunshot going off in your ear, while at the same time the dialog is perhaps one-fifth as loud. miscellaneous on-set noises dominate the soundtrack to a huge degree, with dialog taking a distant back seat. the theme music sounds as if it was about a quarter done when the movie was released, as large portions of the film don't have any music at all. camera-work can best be described as a gnarled mess, with close-up shots where a medium angle would be much better, cameramen walking around and jostling the camera every which way, absolutely no attention paid to framing any scene, they just shot everything from whatever position it was most convenient for the cameraman to stand. if the cameraman was a foot taller than the actors and you end up looking at the tops of everyone's heads, well, so be it. editing is just a butcher job; everything is tossed together in the most abrupt manner possible, nothing flows or transitions in any sense of the word. i don't know if this was shot on video or perhaps a rented camcorder, i tend to think it was the latter. i only made it about three-quarters of the way through this thing before i turned it off, i just got so annoyed at the low quality of the production i couldn't take it anymore. it's like a ninth grade audio-visual class project.

we picked this up as a part of a brentwood set, under the title "the broken skull." shot directly onto video, with widely varying sound and lighting quality, this movie winds up with a hyperactive quality that may inspire the viewer to feelings of nervousness, confusion and irritability - and not in a good, "evil dead" kind of way.without going into spoilers, what appears at first to be a simple revenge ghost story becomes increasingly convoluted and bizarre. while there are some interesting ideas here, the overall effect is likely to leave you scratching your head and saying "hunh?"this is a very, very gory movie. the gore effects range all the way from full bloody head appliances to a silly video toaster effect that has to be freeze-framed to be (dis)believed. the "fangoria" level of gross-out effects in this film is really amazing and should likely please the gore-hounds while making anyone with a weak constitution feel a bit on the queasy side.the broken skull is also an extremely noisy movie. it features not only ambient noises (captured by mikes and not replaced in post), but there is a lot of shrieking. no, no, i mean a lot. a lot, a lot! characters scream, wail, howl and yell, chitter and laugh maniacally. turn down the volume if you value your eardrums and your nerves! but you can't fault the cast for their enthusiasm, they really eat up the scenery and sometimes the effect is rather entertaining. in particular, the actress playing a certain vietnamese immigrant delivers all of the above with a remarkable amount of gusto.in fact, very few of the actors were wooden. some of them may have overacted a bit (oh, just a wee smidgen!), but most of them are certainly fun to watch go off. the cast is ethnically diverse and kudos to the filmmakers for that. the two middle-aged white women, however, are two of the most spiteful, exasperated characters since the shopkeeper in the mst3k classic "the brute man." just watch them seethe at all the other characters, it's fun!in closing, the headcrusher may not become a horror icon on a par with jason voorhees, michael myers or freddy kruger (or even the leprechaun), but we can definitely say this ... this was a movie.

i got this for my birthday in a box set under the name broke skull. well, after watching one on the dvd and being pleasantly surprised, i popped this sucker in. it was worse than i had expected, and i didn't expect much. this movie is basically a convoluted story about a guy who dies and comes back to life with the mob, and other bull crap. there was some interesting ideas in this that were never followed up on. now everybody has been saying there was a lot of gore, can somebody tell me were? i saw a bad effect of a head being crushed, brain tissue (or something...), and blood coming from the penis area two times. i have to say the the part were the guy gets his man hood bitten off made me squirm, that was the only good thing about this movie. and that gay sex scene was just thrown in there for no reason. the acting in this was atrocious, really, it blew. that asian chick was annoying, then the annoying mexican boyfriend who comes in to just be killed. i say if you get this in a box set, that is fine, but don't spend any money on it, at all.

if you thought day after tomorrow was implausible, wait till you see this.okay so the premise of most disaster films is usually a 1 in billion event occurring, compounded by other circumstances. in this case, the even is the joining of two huge storm systems. fair enough so far. oh but hold up, no, the "event" is the sabotage and subsequent destruction of the power grid.next throw in loads of human interest elements - in this case a cheating husband, a psychotic gun-wielding boyfriend, a rebellious daughter, a hacker with a point to prove, a senator trying to push an agenda, a reporter trying to stand up against "the man", and a pregnant women stuck in an elevator.finally add a handful of taster events to add excitement.jeez if the director tried to fit in any more meaningless plot lines, there would have been no time less for the actual disaster, which, given the pitiful state of the computer graphics, was almost certainly the intention.jeez, if you can't even model a truck convincingly, you really should not be taking on twisters, exploding power stations, las vegas getting ripped apart, or destroyed oil stations.in case you didn't already gather how appalling this movie is, let me just add that all three bad guys get killed in separate, and wholly ungratifying, implausible manners, that stunk more of moralising that good film-making.i'm have no problem with first month film students writing jaded, hackneyed, cliché-soaked scripts, but for god's sake, that doesn't mean anyone has to make them into movies!it manages to make the abysmally implausible 10.0 apocalypse look not quite so dreadful. avoid them both.

a wasted effort. on the surface it's a typical disaster movie: we're involved in the lives of a few people who get caught up in the big event. however, the script is so awful and there's so much explaining of the characters' background within the dialogue that we feel we're being treated like morons. even sesame street didn't explain the origins of mr snuffleupagus or how mr hooper died: we can work it out. someone thought that entering 'enron' into the script would give it currency when discussing power companies. the acting is by and large bland, with the exception of the older performers (randy quaid, brian dennehy), and after the first hour, i couldn't care less about who the storms took out.but maybe there are the special effects to watch. sadly, no. even on a 20-year-old tv set i could see one tractor and trailer were computer-generatedbadly. maybe there are budgetary limitations, so i can forgive that one. footage of a plane trying to land looked pretty real, but i kept telling myself i had seen that before. this site confirms it: it was from an earlier film, nowhere to land.so in summary, the only good bits are from another film, and when you see the best action sequences compressed into a 30-second network promo, it makes category 6 look quite good. my advice: rely on your network to do some good 30-second clips, watch them, and save yourself two nights.

i hope that matt dorff's original script for this was much better (there are signs of it - dialogue that should happen well before big f/x scenes (to introduce characters) that would make sense much earlier, is jammed in later in the time-line; perhaps the original script was for a longer running-time. but maybe not -- in any case, this reeks. every character is uninteresting, and *everybody* speaks expository passages as if they are speaking the word of god. there are characters that are entirely expository -- dianne wiest's "secretary abbot" is just awful, explaining things to her assistant (and incidentally us), in endless speeches that no one would say to anyone, ever, in real life (when she isn't explaining things to her assistant that she already knows, her assistant explains things to her that she already knows._ there are characters who are entirely one-dimensional -- the evil power company guy; the pilot who will just not shut up about his personal life and concentrate on his job. the "well-meaning" power-company superdooperuber hacker-guy who can crash*everything* in chicago (including the phones) -- and then gives the oh-no-what-have-i- done speech (but not leave himself a back door?). the crusading reporter who abandons her principles at the drop of a hat? the power-company shift supervisor who abandons his post in the middle of the worst crisis in chicago since the fire -- with no consequences? hospitals abandoned by the doctors and nurses during the crisis (i'm not kidding, that's in the movie.) oh yeah, and it's filled with hollywood morality clichés -- generally women are good, men are evil, unless influenced by a woman (the ultimate is the punk with the gun -- deprived of a woman's influence, he literally goes insane); an evil stupid act (like what the reporter did with hacker-bozo) is all right, so long as you 'mean well'. evil men die, capitalist evil men die as horribly as possible, everybody else lives (well, except randy quaid). and did i hear someone say that the nuclear electrical power generating stations had to shut down because there wasn't electricity to run the safety systems (think about that one)?there is one ray of sunshine (if you'll pardon the expression) -- randy quaid basically plays his character from "independence day" (you know -- "hello boys - i'm baaaack!") -- this time as a storm chaser with an infinite-range suv and superdooper batteries for his camcorders. nevertheless, they kill him -- mostly, it seems, so that the audience will appreciate that tornados are pretty dangerous things (kinda shallow, that.)give this one a pass.

i was sitting at home and flipping channels when i ran across what potentially sounded like an interesting film. i like destruction type movies and decided to watch it. i don't know why but i ended up watching it the whole 2 hours. we have seen this type of movie i don't know how many times.back in 1998 - 2000 there were dozen of films that dealt with global destruction of some sort. the best one on my list so far is deep impact which was more believable than this one. here are my problems with this film: 1) cheap special effects, like something out of the old computer. 2) no background information or explanation on weather patterns. if you are going to make a movie about weather, at least have some decency to entertain the viewer with technical details. 3) how come only 2 or 3 people figure out that the storm is converging on chicago... no more experts left in the field? 4) where are some interesting characters? i truly don't care for anyone except maybe the pregnant woman. i felt that there was no character development. 5) no thought provoking moment what so ever and factually incorrect theme. and this is only the first part of the film. i bet the conclusion will show us few destruction scenes and a search and rescue operation just like it has been done many times before. and judging by the special effects in the first part of the movie, i can only imagine what we are to expect. of course, at the end, the main characters will survive and life will go on... how original

without doubt, one of the worst films ever made. sluggish and without structure, tension or story, the film coasts on the thin premise of "putting together a show". conflicts are resolved within two or three seconds of their inception and dialogue is random and incidental. everything is put together in a slapdash order and often "stepping out" feels more like a deleted scenes reel than an actual movie. the film seems to exist merely as a showcase for gaudy and totally random liza musical numbers. shelly winters can be seen in the far superior octo-epic "tentacles", and the real liza can be found in the showtime release of "queer duck: the movie".

a coming-of-age story about a teenager rebelling against the church and her minister father in a small norwegian village. the countryside setting is picturesque but the story is rather pretentious and plodding, with much of the film devoted to quoting scriptures. it's like watching a religious propaganda movie. theisen, who has made only one other movie, is pretty good as the sensitive young protagonist, as are sundquist as her strict father and riise as a woman that theisen is fascinated with. the film aims to be fresh and charming but feels rather stale and tired. director and co-writer nesheim, who has worked mostly in tv, is not up to the task.

"the james dean story" is introduced as "a different kind of motion picture," explaining, "the presence of the leading character in this film has been made possible by the use of existing motion picture material, tape recordings of his voice and by means of a new technique - dynamic exploration of the still photograph." the only "tape recordings of his voice" noteworthy is one short recording mr. dean make while visiting his family in indiana; he wanted to record any family recollections of his great-grandfather cal dean, intrigued because he played a similarly named "cal" in "east of eden". dean asks if cal dean was interested in art, and learns the relative was an auctioneer. james dean was interested in art and had warm relationship with his family, obviously. that's the only 100% accurate revelation in this documentary. james dean was interested in art and had warm relationship with his family.an amazing "screen test"/"outtake" from "east of eden" appears near the film's end. it's a black and white scene between dean (as cal trask) and co-star richard davalos (as aron trask). dean is at his mesmerizing best. if this scene appeared only here, and no "east of eden" film was completed, this documentary would be an essential, high rated film. but the scene, a perfect "10" in isolation, should be considered an "east of eden" extra. dean's "traffic safety film" is also worth seeing.there are the expected interviews with family and friends. my favorites were the guy (lew bracker) going through a box of stuff dean left with him, and dean's family. there wasn't enough from aunt ortense and the letter from dean to his little cousin was very nice. more reading of dean's letters would have been welcome. dean's unidentified writer friend seemed to have a better thesis for the film; filmmakers might have considered developing it as a main focus.robert altman's direction of martin gabel's reading of stewart stern's script is dreadful. what were they thinking? perhaps, filmmakers can be forgiven due to the closeness of dean's passing. don't expect "the james dean story" at all. this movie is more about dean's effect on people (both the fans and filmmakers) than the man. it is very clearly an early piece of the james dean myth-making "legend". tommy sands sings "let me be loved". the narrative refers to dean as "he" with a god-like air. the shots of dean's family seeming to "know" the moment he dies are truly wretched.** the james dean story (8/13/57) robert altman ~ james dean, martin gabel, richard davalos

this was a sordid and dreary mess. i needed a shower when it was over. it goes something like this- some socialites are murdered and a woman homicide detective is assigned to the case. she discovers that the victims belonged to an underground lesbian society, and she befriends an associate of the group who may have relevant information. since the detective is an attractive woman, of course she is horny and intrigued (which reveals much about hollywood and its psychosis about women). what's surprising is that none of this is very sexy or interesting, just depressing and yucky. ellen barkin gives a respectable performance as the lead detective, and julian sands provides unintentional laughs as a cross-dressing psychiatrist, which is why it escapes a one-star rating.

let's get right to the heart of the matter...this is a terrible movie. the story is confusing, the supporting cast is laughable and the lead actors look like they were forced to be in it. the story asks us to believe there is a underground lesbian sex cult where members are being murdered by their psychiatrist who just happens to be a transvestite. ellen barkin investigates the crimes and develops a crush on peta wilson whose job it seems is to be the cult recruiter. the sex scenes are equivalent to bad porn and when barkin and wilson kiss, poor ellen looks like she's in pain. barkin's talent is totally wasted in this b-grade sexploitation piece of junk and i hope she gave her agent the pink slip after landing her in this film.
