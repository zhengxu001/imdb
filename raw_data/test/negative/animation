once again mr. costner has dragged out a movie for far longer than necessary. aside from the terrific sea rescue sequences, of which there are very few i just did not care about any of the characters. most of us have ghosts in the closet, and costner's character are realized early on, and then forgotten until much later, by which time i did not care. the character we should really care about is a very cocky, overconfident ashton kutcher. the problem is he comes off as kid who thinks he's better than anyone else around him and shows no signs of a cluttered closet. his only obstacle appears to be winning over costner. finally when we are well past the half way point of this stinker, costner tells us all about kutcher's ghosts. we are told why kutcher is driven to be the best with no prior inkling or foreshadowing. no magic here, it was all i could do to keep from turning it off an hour in.

this is a pale imitation of 'officer and a gentleman.' there is no chemistry between kutcher and the unknown woman who plays his love interest. the dialog is wooden, the situations hackneyed. it's too long and the climax is anti-climactic(!). i love the uscg, its men and women are fearless and tough. the action scenes are awesome, but this movie doesn't do much for recruiting, i fear. the script is formulaic, but confusing. kutcher's character is trying to redeem himself for an accident that wasn't his fault? costner's is raging against the dying of the light, but why? his 'conflict' with his wife is about as deep as a mud puddle. i saw this sneak preview for free and certainly felt i got my money's worth.

three businessmen are involved in a bar fight with three mysterious men. the three businessmen take revenge, which escalates to a murder after another. supposedly the story is about the violence that could happen to ordinary people.the plot has too many holes. the details were ignored in order to move the story forward. the acting was uneven. the color balance was awful even though i watched this movie in dvd. the small budget and tight schedule were apparent. the whole thing seems to be an excuse to shoot the final gun fight, and the ending was just unbelievable.

i would put death wish 3 in the same box as stallone's cobra and commando. the box that i would sell for $2 at a garage sale with all the videos inside. the story is about the main character coming back from the previous movies' success to ruin it all with this load of trash. why did the makers want to destroy the reputation of the past 2 films with this cheap junk. the story is so lame that had to be a outrageous sequel. i mentioned cobra earlier because it has the same mood, that one man can kill 20 or 30 gang members without a scratch. both this movie and cobra were bent on showing the hero firing his guns at hip level and the enemy falling in large numbers. police officers spend hours at the shooting range so why did they get gunned down by gang members firing aimlessly from their hips? this movie was so bad i thought for a minute it was death wish 4.

eric roberts "stars" in this tommy lee thomas debut prison film. he plays the leader of a corrupt ring of guards. though evil by most people's standards, his character is the kind of guy who is nice enough to give you supporting wires while you hang chained to the ceiling as he tortures you with "lethal weapon" electric prods.the movie has an intricate plot about prison corruption that makes absolutely no sense. thomas has clint eastwood's squinter eyes, dolph lundgren's one-liners, the acting abilities of jcvd and the body of the tiniest guy you knew in school who took steroids after graduation.martin "cobra kai" kove's career shares this low point with roberts, in the film it is difficult to tell if kove's character is supposed to be drunk for the entire movie or if kove just came that way. i couldn't blame him if he did.fortunately for all involved, this movie has a "so bad that it's good" quality that can be fun if you have absolutely nothing better to do.

2001 wasn't perhaps eric roberts best year. both raptor and this came out. watched raptor a while ago and really thought it sucked and being erics worst. but that had it´s share moment of fun and d-standard. this one doesn't have a thing.tommy lee thomas is the name of the probably worst actor in these days. the story lacks any punch and the whole thing feels even slower than a snail breaking in curves.the two thing that stands out are martin kove and eric roberts. you could argue about their effort being good or what but compared to the rest they are above all criticism.i say thank you roberts see you next time (and hopefully a better one).

enjoy the opening credits. they're the best thing about this second-rate but inoffensive time-killer which features passable performances from the likes of eric roberts and martin kove. the main part, however, goes to newcomer tommy lee thomas who looks a bit diminutive for this kind of action but who, nevertheless, occasionally manages to project a banty-rooster kind of belligerence. the first time we see him he's bare-chested, sweaty, and engaged in that favorite "beefcake" activity -- chopping wood. after this he has seven more scenes without his shirt including one in which he's hanged by his wrists and zapped with electricity a la mel gibson in "lethal weapon." he could use a better script, however, since the manner in which he exposes the truth about corruption and violence inside the prison is never very convincing. there's also talk about millions of dollars which apparently is tied in with this investigation but which is never explained. there are a few pluses, though. sending "john woodrow" undercover as "john wilson" is an amusing play on a presidential name, and co-star jody (ross) nolan shows promise as an inmate who, early in the proceedings, is shown hanged by his wrists and getting punched by a burly guard. one final note: the movie's low budget is painfully responsible for the lack of "extras." despite the impressive size of the prison, it only seems to hold about 12 inmates! (note: the cast credits at the end aren't too helpful. for the record, the burly, bald-headed guard who uses jody nolan as a punching bag is played by bill fishback, and the young, fair-haired guard who administers electric shocks to tommy lee thomas is played by marc chenail.)

when the legends die is a powerful, moving story of an orphaned ute indian who goes on to become tom black bull, a champion bronc rider. raised in the old ways, tom is given a white man's name and must adopt the language and ways of the white man to live in that world. bitter about the role he has been forced into, tom finds fulfillment doing one thing, busting horses, riding them to death, in the rodeo. the movie has richard widmark in the role of red, the man who befriends tom and acts as his manager. red is a drunk who eventually dies in the story, which is about where the movie ends. the real story is completely ignored, the dark side of tom black bull who develops a reputation as a killer of horses in the rodeo arenas. oh well, you should read the book, this movie doesn't come close to doing the story justice.

the first half of this film held some promise as it seemed like the film was going to be a low-key character psychodrama like the minus man but then the whole thing collapses into cliche and the viewer slowly loses all interest. there's a decent cast here but the film is lifeless and the talent completely wasted.

like a lot of the comments above me, also i though this was the average scifi movie, but unfortunately it was not. i found it rather patronizing, and indeed, preaching.but that is not the only comment. the scenes are very 'artificial' (not as in scifi, as i will explain a in a few moments). (the next sentence is a small spoiler.) the movie more or less represents a discussion between two groups. the physical setting of a discussion typically involves two or three men standing next to each other, the middle one typically speaking. in the worst case, the other party is represented by one person.also the interviews the reporters have are very artificial, sometimes even unprofessional. for example sometimes the discussion is between the reporters (i mean, from a point of the interviewed, 'akward'). moreover the interview persons always stay calm, they say everything without normal emotions. i.e. you cannot tell whether they lie or not, are mad or not. they show almost nothing.this is also very unprofessional, the 'christian' reporters always believe everything they are told by the people they interview.bottom line:all conversations contain:- facts- pro/con argumentsthere are no lies. nobody lies. (the next sentence is a spoiler, ignore if you still plan to see the movie) the only lie happening is to demonstrate how 'bad' non-believers are.this makes me conclude that the movie is a b-movie. it is very similar to 'plan 9 from outer space' (from the 50's), but this movie also has an annoying, wrong set discussion about aliens and christian belief.note: i have no intention to insult christians, people who believe in aliens or whomever else. this is a thought i have about the movie, not about people.moreover i would like to note that i don't know whether the actors are bad or were just given terrible scripts.

this movie was the biggest piece of garbage i've seen in a long time.it's marketed as as sci-fi when in fact it's nothing more than a christian recruiting tool.it tells you quite a bit about the state of the christian church, when they have to resort to deception just to get you to listen to their sales pitch. but then again what do you expect from an organization that would go through such great lengths to help protect such an enormous amount of child molesters in their organization.religion is full of nothing but sexual deviants, hypocrites, and war mongers. let's not forget, our bumbling former president actually came out and said that "god told him" to invade iraq. and nobody questioned if he was hearing voices, or seeing things? anyway, going of the subject here. no this movie has nothing to do with ufos whatsoever, it's nothing more than a religious production.

as you can read the only good comment about this movie is made by someone who actually watch it at his church ! anyway, movie had a good b movie sci-fi beginning, everything was there to make a good entertaining , easy to watch movie, then everything felt in this religious jesus-will-save-everyone brainwashing mode.story start with 2 main characters, 2 reporters but it fast give the first role to that jesus freak who is there to save everyone's soul with this con-descendant attitude.in a few words: this movie goes from entertaining to brainwashing in about 30 minuteswaste of time, waste of money... avoid it

ok, this movie, was the worst display i have seen in years. the actors weren't to bad (i figured it was a b-movie so they were doing b-movie acting). anyways, i watched this movie, thinking, oh cool a ufo sci-fi movie. wrong. it was just an excuse for radical christians to push a message onto people. the last scene was extremely messed up. that is a horrible thing to do to a person to make them believe in something. what someone believe in is a matter of opinion. this movie just shows how corrupted religion is, especially christianity.if you want to watch a b-movie, this ain't. if you want to watch a movie that is trying to brainwash the masses. well this is the pick of the litter. go right for it. if you are going to convey a message, do it, don't force it. ridiculous, that people would abuse the media to such a degree. especially, christians.

i watched gomeda on movie theater at my city. my friend took away me and i was really curious what would be it looked like. well, i must say this movie was not a horror,may be we can say that is 'fantsastic experimentation'...ok here i go anyway... but there was a lot of shooting,acting,dramatic,theatrical and storytelling problems.i can understand because of director is very young and gomeda is his first feature film.ok directing of this film was not pretty bad,i see.unfortunately, due to the restraints placed on the film by its extremely low budget, the visuals are often as murky as the storyline.and there is no powerful gothic scenes.as a horror movie it really fails, no scares at all and it is quite muddled and boring. some people say 'gomeda' is an art movie, but i could not see a laughable,terrible and breoken off art movie like that.so, how can we say it is an art movie!just funny!

this movie changed my life! hogan's performance was nothing short of incredible, and i still haven't recovered from his exclusion from the 1990 oscar nominations. and as brightly as the hulkster shines in this movie, you can't discount the brilliant writing and direction that vaults this masterpiece in to the highest strata of achievement in film. if you haven't seen this movie, drop what your doing right now and get yourself a copy. i guarantee it will blow your mind. and if you don't like it, then i just have one question for you.... watcha gonna do when the 24 inch pythons and hulkamania runs wild on you!!!!

... in search of the cheesiest "so bad it's good" movie, i've repeatedly laughed at the first fifteen minutes of various films, only to be left disappointed and bored at the end. not this time!!! my eyes teared up, my belly and my cheeks ached from laughing so hard throughout the movie. sure, hulk hogan is a subpar actor and the plot is utterly predictable, but everyone dives into this movie knowing all this - all anyone wants to see when renting this is hogan breaking out a can of whoopass, with a bunch of "yeah brother"s and "whatchugonnado"s flying from his infamously goateed mouth. and while the hulkster on the screen pales a bit in comparison to the hulkster in the ring, seekers of the ultimate cheese will certainly not be disappointed by this backhand gem of a flick. a laugh riot.

hulk hogan and zeus are horrible wrestlers and horrible actors. hogan for some reason was popular enough to get a movie deal i'll never know why. if not for vince mcmahon's money this stupid film would have never been made. maybe someday someone will make a good movie about pro wrestling. no holds barred is not that movie.

hulk hogan plays rip a professional wrestler who has a big heart but is pushed to the limit when his girlfriend(joan severence) is kidnapped by thugs who are forcing him to take on another wrestler(tiny lister jr.)bottom of the barrel actioner is such a failure that even hogan looks ashamed to be in it, and with the evidence portrayed, he should be.

sammi cheng & andy lau are coupled yet again in their 3rd film -- yesterday once more -- directed by hk's actioneer johnnie to...fans of to's action films will be disappointed to find not a single gun was used in the filming...furthermore, fans of cheng & lau's previous films, needing you & love on a diet, will also be disappointed to find that yesterday is no where near as funny or endearing...mr. & mrs. to (lau & cheng) are a divorced couple...both affluent hk citizens...both incredibly mischievous...both just happened to be professional thieves -- 'two birds of the same feather'....a couple years earlier, they divorced over an inability to find middle ground on splitting the loot...now she's remarrying...to the son of a rich heiress -- a total momma's boy (carl ng) through & through...the soon-to-be mother-in-law (jenny woo) is suspicious of mrs. to's past & thinks she's only marrying her son for the family jewels -- the heiress' priceless ruby necklace...the necklace is stolen...is it mrs. to's materialistic eye that gets the best of her?... or is it her ex-husband, mr. to's way of sabotaging the marriage to steal the jewels for himself?...this is not a movie about two pple falling in love or rekindling a love...its about two pple who have always been in love but have somehow been to foolish to realize it...they let pride & greed overwhelm them...overall: yesterday is one part caper/heist film & one part homage to classic hollywood glamour from its golden years -- i.e. cary grant & grace kelly's to catch a thief...johnnie to is riding too heavily on cheng/lau's chemistry from their previous films...hoping cheng/lau's immense popularity & fan base will be enough justification for this third film....i think sammi cheng is one of the most likable/charming entertainers working t'day...& lau is definitely the tom cruise of asian cinema...i really enjoyed their first two films & consider the cheng/lau pairing comparable to those classic hollywood couples of the 40's & 50's...but yesterday falls very short of expectations...terrible writing, ridiculous situations, product placements galore, & all the subplots & supporting characters were unnecessary...come to think of it...this film was unnecessary...unless you just love celebrity watching...

i've seen several stage and film adaptations of alice in wonderland and this one has to take the cake as the absolute worst. my family bought the dvd unsuspectingly and couldn't even make it through the first half. i later went back and forced myself to watch the whole thing (it had been a christmas gift to me) and was just appalled.the only redeeming factor (and it's hardly redeeming enough to save the whole show) is mark lin-baker playing the mock turtle with a yiddish accent. it's one of the few moments in the piece that has some real charm and can be taken somewhat seriously. other than that, the songs are half-songs, the melodies are half-melodies and even meryl streep cannot make this direction look good.

how can anybody give this anything higher than a '1'?i thought "manos, the hands of fate" would forever be the worst movie ever to impinge itself upon my optic nerve. indeed, i didn't think anything could be worse.i was wrong. "galaxina" is that rare movie where every single element of it is achingly, agonizingly, blindingly bad. how often have you watched a movie and commented, "who the hell lit this thing?" from lighting to soundtrack to effects to script to acting to cinematography to . . . well, everything, this movie is absolutely unendurable. it's so bad, i couldn't even tell for some time if it was the worst comedy or the worst drama i'd ever seen.it's too bad even to be laughable. i'd sooner eat a platefull of broken glass than sit through it again.

if ever there was a film that can be considered a missed opportunity then that film is galaxina. what could possibly be wrong in basing a sci-fi film around a sexy statuesque female android? surely such a film could never be a complete waste of time? well, sadly this movie is pretty close to useless. there are a number of faults with this production it has to be said, however, there are two basic problems that entirely destroy the whole enterprise. firstly, this is a comedy with no funny bits at all, or at the very least a film where the potentially amusing aspects are presented in an incredibly unamusing way. secondly, the title character is woefully underused. this may be because dorothy stratten was not really an actress but if so it was a terrible decision as she is still easily the best thing about the film. i don't think she really needed to be a great thespian to pull off the role of a sexy android to be perfectly honest. anyway, what we are left with is a whole lot of mind-numbing comedy relief, which often is made up of hopeless spoof-type gags of the big sci-fi hits of the time such as alien, star wars and 2001. it's badly written and not funny at all, and it doesn't even really have a plot to propel things along. the story basically is about a police space-cruiser that is sent to get a rock. that's it! steven spielberg once said that a high-concept movie was one whose plot line could be described in one sentence. what he didn't define was what you call a movie that can be described in less than a sentence - pointless maybe?this seemed like a sure-fire winner to me but it failed miserably. it seems to have been an attempt to spoof star wars and combine it with adult comedy situations. all it does actually achieve is to leave you cold and a little irritated that it wasn't close to what it should've been. a barbarella for the 80's this ain't.shortly after this film was finished dorothy stratten was murdered in an appallingly violent and horrific way. and for that reason galaxina has derived a considerable amount of it's cult interest. i just think it's a great shame that dorothy didn't have a better film left to immortalise her.

the odd thing about galaxina is not that it is supremely bad, although it is. the odd thing is that in spite of being supremely bad, it is not funny. supremely bad movies have their own particular brand of unintended humor--the secret of their success, you might say. but galaxina is quite uniquely different--it is mst3k's worst nightmare, a bad movie in which the intentional *and* the unintentional humor alike fall flat.it is easy enough to figure out why the intentional jokes fail--and the reasons are quite varied. sometimes it's a timing question; sometimes it's a good idea badly worked out (the human restaurant *could* have been hilarious, but it wasn't); sometimes it feels like there was some mixup in the cutting room, with the punchline ending up on the floor; and sometimes the jokes are just bad jokes. bad movies get their laughs from such unintentional snafus. it's harder to figure out why galaxina doesn't get any laughs on that count. something is subtly wrong with the unintentional humor in this movie, just as something is wrong (not at all subtly) with the intentional humor. it is a supremely bad movie whose very badness is not the redeeming quality it usually is. it's absolutely unique in my experience.

this is not the worst movie i've ever seen. i did not feel like i wanted to remove my eyeballs forcibly after watching galaxina. it just is not good. the jokes are almost funny, but fall short. all of them. the few gags that come close are beat back down by repeating them over and over. the production values are, well, non-existent. the sound is bad, the lighting is bad, ... it just seems cheaply made; overly so. the dialog ... well, often it is missing - many awkward silences; they are all just standing around, and it seems like someone should be saying something. the film even seems ambivalent about what it wants to be - it is not always clear that it was intended as a comedy - like maybe that developed after shooting started. it feels like someone's film project that they threw together the night before it was due, and if they had put two weeks into it, it could have been good.and i'm easy to please. i thought "mom and dad save the world" was a hoot. i like "pluto nash". "mystery men" is one of my favorite movies. "spaced invaders" is well nigh unto a classic. this turkey just doesn't do it. "space truckers" was more believable.avery schreiber, who can be very funny, tries too hard. his part calls for a straightman, and he plays it leaning toward sitcom. dorothy stratten is ok in her role, but not particularly noteworthy.oh, yeah, the "my watch is always slow." line was funny. i'll give this movie all the kudos it can get, it needs it.the space vehicle models are not bad, but they are few and are not used effectively. the space scenes are vague. no sweeping passes, no close up detailed fly-bys, not even appropriate action scenes when they dock. (the infinity does crash land very oddly at one point.) the flight dynamics are terrible; worse than anything you've seen, they're jerky, not smooth. the initial battle is stilted and static; even though the two ships have just shown that they can maneuver in their jerky fashion, they trade (slow) shots at close range in a manner that is more reminiscent of a 16th century sea battle, except not as exciting.the aliens - imagine if all of star wars was the cantina scene. that many rubber masks could get dull rather rapidly, no? a few are used as sight gags that work ok the first time, but not the fifth.mercifully, if you attempt to watch galaxina, you are likely to fall asleep. (i got busy doing something else and missed the last ten minutes, and did not feel like it was worth replaying it. if that doesn't say "it sucked", i don't know what does.) sadly, there is a lot of potential, and this could easily have been a good movie. it would be easy to remake this and have a decent film.madkaugh

i'm not a movie snob. i've liked lots of movies that critics hate, and i've hated movies that critics love. however, i have to agree with critics here--"galaxina" is just substandard. clearly intended to be a comedy, it only has a few scattered laughs. "galaxina" has poor photography; it has poor special effects; it has some pretty poor acting; and the production values...well, the sets might as well have been made of cardboard."galaxina" tells the story of a spaceship whose crew is looking for a magical object called "the blue star". after a long voyage (and some very unconvincing space battles), the crew arrives at its destination, a sort of wild west alien world. there's a painfully unfunny cantina scene (clearly designed to be a spoof of the famous "star wars" scene), a chase involving space bikers, and a final getaway.the cast tries, but can't breathe life into this turkey. stephen macht and avery schreiber have done better work in other movies. james david hinton is pretty good as a member of the spaceship's crew. the late dorothy stratten stars as the robot of title, and while she looks great, her role doesn't give her much of a chance to act.you might catch this film to see dorothy stratten. however, if you're looking for a good movie, you'll probably want to skip this one.

i've seen worse films. this is bad but at least doesn't try to be good so it deserves a brief round of applause. it rest firmly in the realms of the low-budget b-movie sci-fi genre.it is a rubbish film but in a nice way and is certainly worth buying if it's in the bargain bin at your local supermarket. awfully charming rather than just plain awful.the highlight for me is when galaxina's lover goes to rescue her. upon turning up she exclaims "bunnyfluff!" which draws sniggers from his co-pilot.sit back, get drunk, enjoy!

i thought this movie was horrible. i was bored and had to use all the self control i have to not scream at the screen. mod squad was beyond cheesy, beyond cliche, and utterly predictable.

i really wanted to like this movie, but i just couldn't. it had the potential to be a really cool, hip remake of a cool show, but that's where it fell apart. it was too hip, too cool. first of all, all the cool lines and scenes were showcased in the preview trailers, which i'd seen lots of times. and the editing was very disjointed, so that the scenes didn't seem to flow together and they all seemed out of place. claire danes, who i love as an actress failed to make this her break through to the beyond high school acting roles. the only bright spot was giovanni ribisi as pete. his slightly stupid, yet actually smart style was funny and refreshing. overall though, i'd recommend just watching the previews instead of seeing the movie and wishing it was more.

yawn, that is my reaction to this film. i was really hoping this would have been a good modern day slasher but it doesn't even fall into the category of slashers. instead, it tries to be something it isn't, which is a psychological thriller, and it fails so miserably at this. even the title "freak" suggests that this might be interesting. match this with the cover art on the dvd and you think "ok, maybe i will give this one a try". not worth the time.the story actually starts up a bit interesting with a poor deformed child with bandages wrapped around his head being chained up by his fat mother. she yells at him and probably beats him since in one scene we see her actually slap him for no reason. after all this, he decides he has had enough and smashes her face in with (i believe) a rock. present day, he is now in insane asylum and is being transfered. on his way he breaks out of the van he is in and escapes. introduce also the 2 leads characters, a little girl and her older sister. they are moving and hit the road. so most of the movie is them riding around in the car talking amongst themselves. but, the bandaged "freak" is now on the loose and is about go on a rampage of grueling murder! (this is me being totally sarcastic)i can't believe how boring this movie turned out to be. the budget was on the smallest ever with absolutely no special effects and the dialog i could just care less about. this is one of those movie where the packaging is better then the flick itself. and to compare this to halloween?! rubbish! i am not even a fan of the the halloween series (except the 3rd one) but halloween is far superior than this. at least with halloween we have a great score and some genuinely creepy moments. with this, there is virtually no music except some piano here and there and there is nothing creepy about this movie. maybe this movie would have fared better if it had a solid score because even the worst of movies are tolerable if the music is good.well, that is just my opinion on the movie. i thought it was just a complete waist of time and money. but, since the movie has over a 4/10 rating on imdb, there must be people that like this movie. i am not one of those people. 2/10

i rented this movie because the cover was cool looking, the first 15 minutes of the movie are okay and somehow interesting, but once the young woman and her little sister go on their trip everything goes to hell and the movie becomes boring.

if you are home on a weekend, very bored and lack the will to move, with absolutely nothing better to do with your life for the next couple of hours you could enjoy making fun of this movie. the acting and script and general movie making of this film isn't actually all that bad, which is why it makes it possible to actually sit through this. this is defitnly a movie they would show in high school health class to teach the dangers of pre-marital sex. or they could also show it to teach the dangers of very lame music - that 'rock' band brian austin green is in is really terrible, i think thats a much greater threat to society than unwed parents.

sometimes there's a film so bad that you just keep watching in awe. this is one of those films. of course i can't help that i'm biased. i'm from chicago so i watched the scenes closely for accuracy and i don't find billy crystal funny at all. and i can't stand all that english style photography(tony scott etc) with the smoke machine working overtime and all the flourecent, soft lighting. i suppose we're supposed to believe that billy crystal is really from chicago because he wears a cubs jersey. oh and the plot. if you really think about it, these guys should be locked up, not the bad guys, since they're more dangerous. and of course there's the cliché of the cops on the verge of retiring. but the funniest scene is the climax where the good and bad guys machine gun other to death in the thompson center(a state building!) of course it's a cool building, but it's the equivalent of making a huge drug deal at the white house.

young michael dudikoff like young lord greystoke was abandoned in the jungle on a pacific island as an infant. but instead of being raised by the apes, he fell into the hands of a japanese soldier who was still living there because he hadn't heard the war was over. and like young luke skywalker it turns out he fell into the hands and learned the fighting skills of a ninja.good thing because they were separated and the young kid came down with a case of amnesia, but those fighting skills didn't go away. the orphaned kid, now named joe armstrong enlists in the army and gets himself stationed in the phillipines. meanwhile his obi wan kenobe played by john fujioka gets rescued himself and goes to work as a gardener on the estate of planter and terrorist go between don stewart using a cheesy accent that seems to vary between french and spanish.as these things happen everybody meets and dudikoff both solves the mystery of part of his past and saves the commanding officer's daughter from the bad guys in this golan-globus production. charles bronson was getting a bit long in the tooth now and golan-globus needed a new star for their action flicks. michael dudikoff filled the bill quite nicely and made quite a few films for them including several american ninja sequels.this film is all action and dudikoff dispatches bad guys at a record pace. what he doesn't do, steve james does doing his best rambo imitation and showing his considerable martial arts skills.the film has enough holes in the plot to drive one of those army vehicles through you see in the story. but that's what the ticket buying public doesn't care about. dudikoff certainly looks magnificent stripped to his fighting clothes. no wonder so many sequels were made.

this is the first porn i've ever tried to review. it demands a different approach than usual, since the allegory will not reward dissection. "i'm american. i'm a prudish virgin." "we are european. we are cultured and sex-mad." "it is nice when we all screw each other." lots to talk about! well, there kind of is in fact, relative to your average 60s topless volleyball number anyway. and the enervating patina of 'class' at least delivers clean, detailed compositions. but what the hell kind of thing is that to say about a porn? ok then: the only scene i really (rhetorically) got off on was the first time brigitte maier steps in. there are efforts to toss in a nice variety of race and age while letting no two men anywhere near each other; the one black guy suffers a premature bout of editorial coitus interruptus. and multiple takes or not, one perhaps undescribable-on-imdb act does look like it was partially simulated by a surgical hose. still, i stayed awake, and it was eight in the morning...but what does the last shot mean?!

there are actually some good reasons, why a person should take the risk of going totally insane by watching this show. the breasts are nice, even though some of them aren't that real, but they usually come in pairs, which is good. watching the beach on your screen is also a very relaxing experience, as it is an ideal place for just taking it easy and not worrying too much about getting eaten by a rubber shark. it's always good to remember, that david hasselhoff is a god. not the god, but a god. it's not so much about his acting skills, since there are none, but his chesthair does a lot of talking. also, there's no kitt hanging out in this series, which is good, since mr hasselhoff told in an interview, that he always thought kitt was gay. naturally that might make him to look like an idiot, but considering the other statements he has made lately, it shouldn't be surprising to anyone.in a nutshell, this is the kind of show, that is totally harmless to people. it gives us a lot to stare at and a lot to laugh at, which is something many intentionally humoristic shows really don't give us. i have to say, it's no wonder that borat fell in love with pamela anderson. i enjoy watching the show. no, it's not a great show, actually it's quite horrible, but i enjoy watching it. it's basically like a b-movie stretched to last for a decade.

although the movie was only so so the closed captioning was by far the best i have ever seen! most of the time the spelling is terrible and the captioning out of sync. i use the closed captioning even though i can hear well but find a lot of actors mumble. also many times the sound track overrides the dialogue. thanks!

this movie is so bad, they wouldn't buy it back at my local used cd/dvd store. i only own it because it came in a box set which i bought for the masterpiece "deadfall". the store bought back the other two movies i was selling from the four disc set, but they wouldn't buy back underworld, and those other two movies redefined rank, so what does that say about this movie? so i tried to sell it back to another store, that even bought back budget dvds that you could buy for a dollar at a local store, but they wouldn't buy back underworld either. this movie is bad on every level, and is one of those that came out in the post-tarantino-clone glut of the mid 90's. the only slightly redeemable element is dennis leary telling joe montegna, that he's a "stinky friend" and calls him "mister stinky friend". that line is so delightfully horrible, that i can't help but quote it at least once a week when describing a stinky friend. but now that i've enlightened you with that quote, you don't have to go thru the pain of watching this movie.

i like a good novelty song. no, i take that back. i love a good novelty song. i absolutely despise ggrobar on the other hand, and have from the first note i ever heard. when i found out someone had made a cartoon based on it, my head almost exploded. now that i have seen it because my kids begged me, i wish my head had exploded. it would have saved me from the excruciating misery that was this cr@pfest. first of all, making an hour long show based on a three minute novelty song is a ridiculous idea. to stretch a song like this, which had to pad like crazy just to be that long, into an entire hour, is even more ludicrous. this was poorly written, cheaply animated, poorly acted...the list goes on and on. dear god, is this ever bad.

if we really want to get serious and find osama bin laden, then we should take this stinker down to gitmo and force the detainees to watch it. they'll be singing within minutes. of course, i'm sure that making them watch this god-awful dreck violates the geneva convention in several ways. look, my 5 year old daughter isn't allowed to watch tv at home. so take her to her grandparents or cousins and she's a little tv zombie. she got up and walked away after about ten minutes. that's how bad this is. you know, when the person responsible for this garbage was a young writer, i bet he or she had dreams of the great american novel. now they have to look in the mirror every morning with the realization that they wrote what is possibly the worst hour of television in the history of the medium.and we wonder why the rest of the world hates us...

trite and tiring, the one-liners almost made me cry. my 4 year old left the room and ended up doing a puzzle. i don't know what age group this was written for, but the writer himself/herself didn't even want credit. as for the song, it's mildly amusing. at least it was a decade ago. there are many christmas movies to watch. although i've seen some many more times than this, they are still enjoyable. whenever this comes on, i try to encourage my child to watch something else. one positive note, that allowed a vote of 2 instead of 1, is that it encourages good moral values. that would have been encouraging, if anyone were watching.

wow, i swear this has never happened to me before. i only watched "golden temple amazons" yesterday and already i haven't got the slightest recollection of anything that happened in this film. that's how brilliant this movie is, i guess! by now i only remember being lured into watching it because of the incredibly attractive dvd cover art, showing a torrid drawing of a voluptuous amazon preparing her bow to fire at an unspecified target. i often get fooled by appealing dvd covers  especially jess franco ones  and i still haven't learned to resist even after literally hundreds of awful experiences. oh well after reading the other user-comments, some parts of my memory returned although i still suspect to confuse this film with another jess franco masterpiece i watched the day before, namely "diamonds of the kilimanjaro" (and, yes, that one had an awesome dvd cover as well)."golden temple amazons" opens with a posse of hot white african amazons  i am aware of the contradiction but don't blame me  slaughtering the parents of a fragile young girl because they were trespassing the turf with the intention of stealing the golden treasures from the temple. several years and hormonal changes later, the girl returns to the jungle to get her revenge. she's accompanied by a bunch of sleazy adventurers who are less interested in the act of vengeance but wouldn't mind taking some gold back home. the rudimentary premise is obviously secondary to all the showcasing of ravishing female nudity and gratuitous sleaze. analía ivars, eva léon and the other nameless amazons are all regular franco choices and willingly walk around with their breasts proudly exposed. you better enjoy gazing at all these perfect female curves, as the rest of "golden temple amazons" is a boring and incompetent mess. there's hardly any violence or action and no less than half of the film is pure filler, bits and pieces of national geographic documentaries edited into the story and that sort of stuff. the awesome dvd cover would definitely be a great addition to your collection, but opening the box is utter pointless.

. . . and that is only if you like the sight of beautiful woman with nice, bouncy jugs running around the so called african jungle. so no problems there for most males out there.i watched it as one of those bundled together package. forget about the plot which is essentially just a flimsy storyline to get our heroine flashing her jugs on screen at every opportunity possible. just to give you a sense, our heroine swings from vine to vine and climb on top animals at every chance possible for no good reason at all just to let you see her jugs at all angles. again, no complaints.the "fight scenes" are laughable and borderline on the pornographic. our heroine got caught by the baddies at least five times in the movie. on occasions when she has to fight, the "fighting" involves rolling around in the dirt, grunting unconvincingly and basically fighting like kittens. i am surprised no hair pulling is involved. it get so bad that the chief baddie had to remind the "combatants" that "i said, the one that draw first blood wins!" in order to avoid watching anymore stupid fighting.the witch doctor kuku was a bloody blast. from being a big, cuddly bear in the beginning, he became manic depressive when captured and then, outright psycho. he spent the whole movie muttering lines with no irrelevance.beside liana (our heroine)bouncing around topless, you also get to see plenty of other amazonians as well as one woman who decided to jump naked into the lake to take a swim for no good reasons. yeah, it is that kind of movie.watch the beautiful liane in her bouncy glory. despite the movie being more than 20 years old, the allure of watching blond women flashing their nice jugs on screen never gets old.

years ago, i used to watch bad movies deliberately. somehow i missed this one. no gesture rings true. no facial expression fits the scene or the action. i've never heard such inappropriate music for a film. at the final scene, i was rooting for the car to run over that ridiculous kid - one of the worst child actors ever.only one name in it i ever heard of - wilford brimley. he must've been very hungry to take this part.do not under any circumstances, watch this movie!!! you've been warned!!!

in my opinion, a good documentary - especially one dealing with controversial political issues - should be informative and as unbiased as possible. the point should be revealing the truth. this means, in particular, having among the interviewees experts on the subject and representatives of all sides. this film is a failure in this regard. most of the interviews included in this film consist of "men off the street" expounding on the question of peace in the holy land. the wall itself, the supposed subject of the film, is given no serious treatment at all. for most of the interviews, the interviewer simply waits to be approached and asks general questions such as "what do you think of the wall?" - she does not approach random people near the wall and ask them how they have been directly affected by it. outside of one interviewee, the israeli general in charge of the wall's construction, we have no "experts" on the subject to provide us with the wall's context (e.g. how and when the project began, whether it has been successful, which groups are for and which against the project, etc.)outside of the interviews, a very large portion of the film consists of extended shots of uneventful scenes, such as head-on shots of the wall, construction of the wall, and people getting off a bus. these shots take up far too much time, in my opinion. it's nice to see what the wall looks like, but the 20-30 minutes of head-on filming of the wall (and only the wall) are excessive. clearly, these shots (accompanied by arabic music that conveys a sense of mourning) are included for the sole purpose of arousing in viewers feelings of loathing for the wall.

this movie is so bad it's almost good. bad story, bad acting, bad music, you name it. o.k., who are the jokers that gave this flick a '10'?

i was told jon was for awhile on spiritual experiences. i guessed the film will be interesting.in fact isn't at all. not so much profound for a such subject. "eternity" never-ending life. experiences after death and "dejavu". the film is not as a comedy but isn't funny at all, at least not express yet. it's so naive. charming film but naive film. a must to avoid. the middle ages sequences seems coming directly from fairy tales and it's not the matter at all. eileen davidson is so charming and voight is doing his best. normal is a co producer and screenwriter of this movie. the film was launched straight on video so i discovered it on a video store. it's a pity 'cause i well know voight was seriously involved with spirituality and the film isn't so much profound about it.

i can't figure out what jon voight could possibly have been thinking when he got involved in this tenth-rate, incoherent, pretentious, mind-numbing slop. he helped to write the alleged "script" himself, and he should be damn well ashamed of it. the film (i can't call it a "movie" because it barely moves at all) is rambling, embarrassingly pretentious drivel--sort of like a really bad oprah winfrey show, but worse. it meanders senselessly back and forth from medieval times to modern-day los angeles, with voight as a television producer who thinks he is the reincarnation of a medieval prince who must save the kingdom from the machinations of his evil brother, and somehow this gets transferred to modern times where voight has to save the country from the evil machinations of an oil company executive. if the bizarre casting (wilfrid brimley, frankie valli (!), kaye ballard and armand assante, among others) isn't enough to kill it, the stupefyingly inept direction, the washed-out photography (it looks like it was shot with a really cheap 16mm camera), the almost complete lack of editing (scenes either go on and on endlessly or are chopped off in the middle of a sentence), and voight's embarrassing, apparently stream-of-consciousness "acting" are enough to bury it, which is exactly what should have been done with it. a jaw-dropping experience. avoid this dog at all costs.

this is the lamest, crappiest, idiotic, stupid movies i ever saw in my entire life... i can't believe there are directors who make these kinds of movies... this movie is a disgrace to horror genre... acting ??? oh! no !!! i couldn't bear... it's full of anguish... don't ever watch this movie... you'll feel like u are being tortured to eternity... please, save yourself from the horrible fate of watching this movie... if you really want to live, don't watch it... there are very good horror movies... this movie doesn't deserve tat single vote too... but, i hate to vote if i want to post my comments...

this movie was bad and the movies about how some college students stay at a house to get money by renovating it and then they find out that the house has a woman deamon in it and that there is a portal to hell.in this movie there are heaps of stupid scenes like at the start of the movie how they are cleaning the house and they start to dancing to a cheesy song and some of the demons at the end of the movie are just some guys in bad costumes trying to make scary sounds and there are some good gore scenes like when the professor gets his face ripped of.i only hired this movie because i am a big fan of horror movies and its only worth watching if u are a fan of horror movies.the acting in this movie is really bad the only good actor is roy scheider from the great movie jaws and over all this movie has heaps of flaws and my rating is 4 out of 10.

a rather mild horror movie; if not for a couple of sex scenes, it could easily have been a tv movie. plot holes abound (one example: why would there be a secret passage from the 18th century leading from the upper floor of a house that was burned to the ground and a new building put ther 200 years later?), cardboard acting, characters doing things that anyone with an iq bigger than their shoe size wouldn't do...it's got a few fun moments, but overall it's a sub-par film that managed to get roy scheider because his bills were due. if you're looking for an extremely formulaic, predictable film that might provide a few laughs, it might be worth watching. if not, then this one's not for you.

cheap, gloriously bad cheese from the 80's, the decade of cheese. i watched this one first uncut and un-mst3k'ed, and it was pretty much laugh out loud funny even without the comments.the plot(such as it is) revolves around a post-apocalyptic world in which the ai robots revolted(sound familiar?) and destroyed pretty much everything, leaving a world in ruins with air so bad no one can breathe it. the few humans that are left act as slaves to an enigmatic being called the dark one, which seems to be part computer and part organic being. the 'air slaves' work to produce energy for this being in return for breathable air. every once in a while, the dark one has the strongest of the air slaves fight to the death, so that no one will rise as a leader in a revolt against the dark one.okay, that's the so-called serious stuff. on to the silly stuff, such as the ridiculous quasi-futuristic clothing that everyone sports, including car seat cover 'fur' garments, loin cloths, and spangly stuff and feather boas(worn mostly by the dark one's henchwoman, a chick with an unrecognizable and almost non-understandable accent). or the wooden acting and stilted lines sported by all of the so-called 'actors', who's dialog is high on pretension and low on sense. or the dime store special fx, including pink socks with teeth glued onto them for 'deadly' sewer snakes, a bomb made of strung piano wire and a tin can, and terrible 'mutants' with halloween rubber masks on.a band of air slaves follow their leader, a mysterious wanderer who has adapted to the air outside, to go to the energy plant to destroy the dark one. the guy's name is neo, which explains where the wachowski brothers got the idea for the matrix. they meet up with a group of amazons along the way, with the obligatory fight scene in which the female is bested(of course). has anyone else ever noticed that in every amazon movie or t.v. show ever produced, these so-called amazing warriors always get their butts kicked by either men or women? amazons are just pansies, i guess.this band of determined warriors makes their way through central park...errr...the ravaged lands beyond the last standing city(good way to save money on the matte paintings of a destroyed new york city, anyway) and journey into the sewers leading to the power station where the dark one and his go-go girl henchwoman valeria hang out. here they vanquish such ferocious beasts as the sock puppet worms, a giant spider no one sees, and the goofy lobster robot who is one of the dark one's personal guard. the final showdown is pretty sad. one of the slaves, a girl who's father was taken by the dark one because he'd produced a way for people to breathe the foul air, sees that her father has been 'consumed by the dark one's true form", which involves him being eaten by a giant avocado until only his head is sticking out. the three remaining adventurers destroy the dark one by turning off a few switches, and the robot holocaust dies not with a bang but with a whimper. the two humans exchange some amazingly wooden last lines, and that's it. the end.

i was so "impressed" with tim kincaid's mutant hunt that i gave this one a try. it is the near future, post apocalypse of course. a wandering fighter named neo (no, not that neo!) joins a group of similar looking fighters to challenge the dark one and his underling valaria. along the way they encounter mutants, crazed females, sewer worms, a big spider leg and some clunky robots. oh my! sadly, robot holocaust is hardly up (or down) to hunt's level. clocking in at a painful 79 minutes (the box says 90), this is one cheap flick. the sets have all the elaborate design of a carnival haunted house and the costumes prove that in the near future everyone will dress like john travolta in the final dance number of staying alive. the atomic wasteland is a combination of rubble filled old buildings and central park. the dark one's headquarters is ominously named the power station and looks like, well, a power station. the acting is universally bad except for angelika jager as the evil valaria. jager is a whole 'nother level of bad. vit er sick cherman acczent, she gives a performance so amazingly bad that it becomes the sole reason to recommend this film. she also delivers the film's only nudity in the "pleasure chamber" section of the film. ed french again supplies the robot effects but they aren't nearly as slimy as his work in mutant hunt.

i kind of like jag. it do have it´s charm but lately it´s to much propaganda in it. for an outsider (a non american) the patriotic feeling can be a bit to much.i don´t like that rabb and mackenzie goes from being lawyers (as they were in the early parts of the tv show) to become super heros that stops wars and rescues entire continents. its almost like watching a recruitment video from the us army.i still watch the show, so it´s not that bad. but i would prefer more episodes when rabb and mackenzie investigates military accidents and don´t save the world in the future.

28 years before 9/11, there was another 9/11 which represented a key date in the history of chile, south america and the whole world. this was the date in 1973 when a bloody coup in chile deposed salvador allende the first marxist president elected democratically anywhere in the world and put an end to the chilean experiment of a democratic transition from capitalism to socialism. allende committed suicide when the armed forces attacked the presidential palace.unfortunately this film is too biased and too nostalgic towards the time of allende's rule to be an objective rendition of the man and of his place in history. the times were troubled and allende was a disputed figure in the history of his country and of the whole world. true, he was democratically elected, but his policies plunged chile into economic crisis. he was deposed by a coup and a right-wing dictatorship followed with repression and flagrant human rights abuses, but he was also an ally of castro who saw in his policies another way of making revolution. we'll never know if his tentative to build a socialist yet democratic society would have succeeded. the authors of the movie take a completely pro-allende position, there is no opinion or point of view trying to explain the other side, to answer questions like why did the middle class oppose him, or how his democratic views could go together with supporting or being supported by castro. the tone of the commentaries is nostalgic and apologetic, almost propagandistic. people who want to get a better understanding of this episode of the history need to wait for a more balanced and objective film or book in the future.

this movie looked like it was rushed to release for some reason. definitely not a well made movie. so unbelievable. the scenes where the president (holbrook) were downtown and walking among the people were a farce. there would not be a chance for the common folk to be within 30 yards of the president in that situation in real life. if it wasn't for the blood and profanity, this was shot like a tv movie. it could have been decent if it was done differently. holbrook's (president) talents were never realized in this movie. shatner's acting is okay. the production values in this movie leave a lot to be desired. overall, i think most people would be better off not wasting time to watch this affair.

all i can do is echo the sentiment already expressed by some of the other commenters. this is city of god meets happy days. the bipolarity of the ruthless thug (one minute a ruthless killer, the next minute a luv's diaper commercial) is completely unconvincing. you can approach it in one of two ways: (1) a gritty, realistic movie turned sappy; or (2) a sappy, abc-afterschool-special with profanity, violence and animal cruelty. either way it just don't fly, do it? why then has it received so much praise? as others have implied, it gets the "conscience vote" from the west. show us pictures of poverty to contrast against our fluffy, double-wide theatre seats and 44-oz cokes, and we'll applaud in a heartbeat. but--oh--don't forget to candy coat it, because the bitter pill of reality (tantalizing as it is) is hard for us to swallow.i'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades, especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there. all i can say is: beware of any film that receives awards (hollywood oscars = sweeping, syrupy tripe. cannes film festival = beard-stroking, artless propaganda). to find the real gems, you'll have to work hard at it.

like most musicals of the era, one must check reality at the door. broadway melody of 1938 is not remotely believable nor plausible, but kind of fun in its strange way. this movie is really just an excuse to execute the talents of the stars. some scenes just happen as if they were in a review, not a plot driven movie.judy garland shines and it's a pity she has so little to do unless much was left on the cutting room floor.one of the most inane happenings are the way eleanor powell get a lead role in a broadway show and robert taylor says it's going to be work, work, work from dawn til dusk. several scenes go by and there's no work, no rehearsals...nothing. she needs money to win a horse in an auction. she has no money. isn't she getting paid while she rehearses? taylor has to borrow money to help. he's supposed to be a big time producer. he has no money??? anyway, that's just two elements in this strange story.the musical numbers are quite wonderful which saves this from being a total loss. broadway melody of 1940 is much better as is broadway melody of 1936.

the hindi remake of mrs doubtfire starring and directed by kamal hassan is a somewhat shoddy version, and not as good as expected.kamal hassan clearly struggles with hindi dialogs, even after all these years, and cannot handle even one scene effortlessly. the guy has aged and should give it a rest. hassan doesn't bring anything new to the role or to the character as say, dustin hoffman does to tootsie, or marathi actor macchindranath kambli does to mavshi's (aunt's) character in "moruchi mavshi" (moru's auntie, comedy play).what was the kid doing playing with firecrackers when it wasn't diwali? most of chachi's romantic 'cross-connections' -- vs amrish, paresh and then johny walker, seem redundant to the main storyline. tabu's bathing scene was unnecessary. the family is north indian but must be reminded of karva chauth night by a 'maharashtrian' chachi. yeah, right.the fine acting skills of not one but four actors namely tabu, om puri, the late amrish puri and paresh rawal have been wasted in this film.watch the original mrs doubtfire -- clean, crisp and crackling with fun, quite unlike chachi 420.

now i remember what the 'indie' filmmakers were ripping off before pulp fiction. it was david lynch, right?i hunted this thing down to see kyle secor. what a waste of a perfectly good bayliss. it was so painful to watch him, sort of like when someone you love is horribly sick and there's nothing you can do.nearly every cliche in the book: the desert, the psycho, the quirky mob boss, the biker, tracy walker (who fortunately was only in one scene, but i kept expecting him to reappear and say something strange and profound like "if a man wants to know where he's going, he's got to look at where he's been," or some contrived garbage like that). i have a theory as to why so many indies are short on location in the desert. i think it's because they can save money on lighting.if you like to be in pain, find this movie and give it a viewing. if you're a fan of kyle secor, watch reruns of homicide on court tv. if you want a good, quirky road thriller, check out wild at heart.there is a reason that no one has heard of delusion! my god, what a waste of a good title.

"delusion" is what you experience when you watch this flick and then believe you saw something worthwhile. this flick, which tells of a trio of semi-psycho travelers who are up to no good somewhere in the ca desert, is amateurish and just plain stupid. the film suffers from an awful story, a lousy screenplay, and some terrible direction just to mention a few of the deficits. if the flick has anything at all going for it, it's b-movie diva rubin's even performance. don't waste your time on this turkey. (d)

everything you do in this world should make at least a little bit of sense. unfortunately very little of "delusion" makes any sense. jennifer rubin is adequate in her role as the main squeeze of hit man kyle secor. secor on the other hand overacts to the point of annoyance. jim metzler, the embezzling yuppie is very unbelievable as the novice, revenge seeking, adversary. when jennifer rubin gives back the money she has carefully been concealing, all credibility flies out the window, and the guns pointing final showdown between secor and metzler is beyond ridiculous. avoid "delusion", unless you are delusional enough to believe the misguided positive reviews here. - merk

this turned out to be more of a women's romance-soap-suspense film than what i hoped it was....simply a tense thriller. yes, the final 20 minutes were suspenseful but much of the previous 75 bordered on being just plain tedious.ruter hauer was a little too subdued, not playing his normal intense character. natasha richardson sports somewhat of a dumb look most of the time and her character was very unappealing.the story is so-so. it's not as bad as i'm making out, but it sure isn't anything i'd watch again, and the back of the vhs describing this movie was misleading.

this is without question one of the worst movies i have ever seen. however, it is also one of the most unintentionally hilarious. i like to compare it to plan 9, in that it can be so bad, so awful,so dumb, and such a waste of time that i find myself laughing out loud.one of my biggest problems with it is that it's a complete ripoff of robin hood, and let be honest and say that i love robin hood with errol flynn, and robin hood: men in tights. but let's face it, from the forbidden love between peck (who is definitely slumming it. although in all fairness this was still a good few years before the masterpiece to kill a mockingbird) and the female character (who is so forgettable, apparently, that i have forgotten her name.), to the final scene where the good guys dress up as monks to fool the bad guys screams "robin hood" all over it.however, i don't think the film isn't worth seeing. on the contrary, i think that this is one of the funniest movies i've seen in years, even if it was unintentional.

originally i wrote what was a sarcastic,scathing review of this pathetic piece of dung,but every time i submitted the review i got "this contains a very long word which is not allowed", also words that were not misspelled were judged incorrect. now the word that was judged too long was never identified.after numerous attempts at eliminating words eventually i got the sneaking suspicion that the imdb site is politically sensitive and set to reject certain words automatically.nothing i wrote was obscene or racist in itself.but after eliminating all of the longest words the same message was repeated again and again,also words that weren't judged misspelled were all the sudden considered misspelled!the pc police are everywhere.

the title tells it all -- ed gein, the butcher of plainfield.it's not a zappy action-filled slasher movie made for teens high on energy drinks. that would fit it into a well-established genre, the kind that some people find entertaining, something along the lines of "halloween" or "the texas chain saw massacre".this is dark, slow, filled with chopped-up corpses, and quietly evil. there are few shock cuts, no monster's point-of-view shots, no loud electronic score. i don't know who it's aimed at -- ghouls, maybe.beneath the credits we already see still photos of skulls, carcasses hung up, skins draped across the backs of chairs, that sort of thing. and they're sufficiently revolting that i couldn't help thinking this movie had better be pretty good to make up for this grand guignol opening.alas, it's not. the acting is uniformly terrible, as in a high school play. the script does its best to sink below vulgarity. ed gein, who killed only two middle-aged women and maybe his brother, chases a screaming, bloody young woman through the woodland of weir, and she's wearing only a modern bra and bikini, rather than period underwear. gein also decapitates a night watchman, which he never did in any historical sense.the direction? you could do a better job. in the first few minutes, law officers discover an abandoned car with blood spattered all over the windshield. there is no body. the handsome young deputy sheriff turns to his boss and suggests they search for the victim, who may still be in the vicinity and living. the sheriff, lacking any motivation, shouts at him, "now you just forget that! i don't want you going off half cocked on anything!" it should be no more than a business-like exchange of views. why does the director have the sheriff so angry? characters of diverse sorts listen to radio programs or records that play old jazzy pop songs -- louis armstrong's "ain't misbehaving," for instance. this is -- what -- rural wisconsin in the 1950s? and the characters insist on music that would appeal to customers of the cotton club in harlem in the 30s, or new york intellectuals like woody allen. nope. the radio would be playing kitty kallen's "wheel of fortune" or theresa brewer or, equally likely, lefty frizell. not that the dysfunction between the music and the events adds anything to our understanding of what's going on beneath the images. someone involved in the production just liked old jazzy pop songs, that's all.of course there's only so much you can do with a low budget, but it can be light years ahead of this butchery. see "ed gein," with steven railsback for an example of a much more sophisticated way of dealing with this lunatic and his penchant for dead bodies, and on a budget that couldn't have exceeded this one by much.these comments are all based on the first twenty minutes of the movie. that's about as far as i could get. if anyone finds this tale to be well-executed and fascinating in any way, he should try to find some insight into his tastes. it's beneath mine -- and i consider myself pretty warped.

old ed was active back in the late 1950's he was apprehended 16 november 1957. the pr-24 police baton was invented in 1974. yet the cops in the movie are all carrying the pr 24. back then it would have been a standard "billy club" not the side handled pr 24. sheeze, if you are gonna make movies do your research and get it right. also it makes no mention of ed's usage of the bodies. he tanned most of the skins and made various articles including a lampshade, a belt and several masks. he also had a large selection of "shrunken heads" that several local children knew about as he often babysat for them. he was found incompetent and committed to the central state hospital for the criminally insane.

the story of ed gein is a disturbing and terrifying story. ed was truly a messed up character and his legacy went on to inspire such 'greats' as the tooth fairy, norman bates, and leatherface. how is it then that such a fascinating man has inspired such a boring melodramatic piece of drivel?? ed gein made belts out of nipples, bowls out of skulls, lamps out of skin, danced around under the moon in suits of human skin. none of this made it into the movie because they needed to give us a fictitious story of a ridiculously awful deputy and his rather homely, sex-starved girlfriend. this movie seemed to go out of its way to falsify history. what baffles me is that most movies stray from the path of truth to exaggerate history; this one seems to do it to minimize it. i just don't get it.

i did a review for this director's fictional recreation about btk. i had also seen this movie and it was terrible. please save your money and time. this movie was terrible and this director is untalented. i do not understand how he is funding these movies. they are horrible. i have decided to make sure that i check who the writer, director, and producer are, and if this director's name pops up i will not waste my money. there is nothing worse than renting a movie on a friday night, making the popcorn, and then realizing you have been duped by creative art on the front of the movie box. stay away. so i guess i should make up some stuff to fill in the lines? i have always checked imdb for reviews before, but i think i will not anymore. this is ridiculous. i have been corrected in my reviews far too many times. not enough lines? you may cancel my account. your site is a pain.

i would hate to have anyone watch this "inspired by a true story" movie and draw any conclusions about the true event. few things they did get right were overshadowed by the things that were just not true. ed gein never dragged anyone behind a car, never met up with anyone at the graveyard and killed them, no proof he returned body parts to the graveyard. the things he did were awful enough, why try to make it worse? this movie ranks among my 10 worst wastes of eye strain. "in the light of the moon" is a much better film on the subject, it is more factual and the acting is superior in contrast to this one.

it's not often i give two stars to a horror movie because horror is my favorite genre. a movie can be bad in that it isn't a masterpiece but can be enjoyable on the basis of unintentional humour, bizarre characters, etc. a case in point are a great number of horror/sci-fiction movies from the 1940s to 1980s era. they are enjoyable for genre-buffs and guilty-pleasure seekers because their "badness" is entertaining. however, this movie has none of the humour or effective gory scenes of the "piranha" (1978) original. i suppose in 1995 it was the heyday of political correctness so gore on tv was at a minimum. now in the mid-2000s with the c.s.i. shows, tv's an absolute blood-fest! (good for us horror fans!)william katt and alexandra paul are no bradford dillman and heather menzies (the original 1978 stars.) it's not katt's and paul's faults but the writers and director who created this tepid turkey. how the main characters interact is the main flaw of this movie. i won't say how because that is part of the plot. this tv movie probably had a bigger budget than the original but flopped as good horror, as can be seen from the user votes here. stick with the 1978 original if you're in the mood for a killer-fish movie!

i saw this one at sundance, and i can't figure out why it won the directing award. it was painfully slow and literally colorless. it's the type of movie that is only appreciated by film fest snobs who think any movie that a lot of people like must be beneath them.the jury at sundance this year seemed to be making a conscious effort to reward the underdog, ultra-low-budget films. that's all well and good, but this wandering, dragging mess looks like a home movie. mini-dv shot in a snow-covered gray winter results in a drab look for a drab movie.certain motifs (snakes) are beaten to death in spite of the fact that they add nothing to the story and make no sense as symbols.now, it wasn't all bad. vera farmiga is phenomenal in her role as a mother with a drug problem. she will be going places, and she deserves it. her co-star hugh dillon also does a fine job. frankly, there are many fine moments in this movie, but they just don't fit together very well.

what is it about drug addiction that so draws first-time filmmakers to offer their own take on the subject? this subject has been done to death. drug abuse is bad. we get it. drug addiction is painful to watch. we get that too. but the bleak subject matter doesn't give the filmmaker license to make a sloppy film. every film need not be hitchcockian masterpiece of cinematic excellence, or use orson wellesian deep focus, but it's still a narrative movie. verite does not mean pseudo-documentary. even consumer mini-dv cameras are capable of producing white whites and black blacks, and this filmmaker is just being lazy by shooting no contrast scenes with existing lighting: the subject is bleak enough without artificially forcing it with sloppy cinematography. and even documentary films have a sound mix. vera farmiga is very talented, given the right material, but the director obviously over-directed her and sucked all the life out of her performance. addicts may live in a fog, but they still have emotions, but none of these characters seem to exist off-screen. the supporting players merely delivered their lines without creating real people. sorry to be so harsh, debra, but some things are true whether want to believe them or not. i'm sure your next film will be better -- but please, not another drug movie. :)

nothing to watch here. it's all been done (and better) before. who cares about this woman - deficient in every way - as a mother as a wife and as a friend? in one instant when she could have taken the high road - she jumped into re-addiction with both feet and held her breath - for no better a reason than "me, too!" if she wasn't the pretty and young person she portrays on screen - but looked more like the real human wreckage that is represented by our family members, neighbors and friends who really suffer from additions we'd change channels in a nanosecond.this movie starts out at the bottom and goes downhill. nothing redeeming, no lessons taught - nothing uplifting in any way. none of the main characters even evoke sympathy, let alone empathy. (well, maybe the snake.) i would have had more fun if i'd shut a door on my hand. who needs drivel like this?

given the subject matter of drug addiction down to the bone almost can't help but be a rather depressing film. but depressing doesn't necessarily have to mean bad. unfortunately in this case it is in fact pretty bad. the film has some good things going for it, most notably the quality performance of vera farmiga in the central role of irene, a working mom struggling with a cocaine addiction. but there isn't enough good here to outweigh the bad. the film's failings lie mainly with the story, which fails to captivate and never really seems to get going. irene goes to rehab and comes home to a clueless husband who has no idea how to support her attempt to kick her habit. irene grows close to another recovering addict, a male nurse from her rehab center. complications ensue. but the story never really sparks to life. it doesn't seem as if the movie is really going anywhere. you can say it's a stark, realistic look at the day-to-day struggles of an addict. maybe so but in this case it doesn't make for an interesting movie. the whole thing has a very "blah" feel to it. the minimalist cinematography doesn't help matters, adding another layer of drab to the incredibly drab proceedings. and none of the other performances measure up to farmiga's. hugh dillon is ok as irene's male nurse friend but nobody else in the cast adds anything of value to the proceedings. all in all this movie is a bleak, depressing and rather dull ride.

no one can say i wasn't warned as i have read the reviews (both user & external), but like most of us attracted to horror movies... curiosity got this cat. (come on, we all scream at the people in the movie not to go into the dark room, but you know that's horror aficionados are always dying to know what's in there even if we know it'll be bad).the bottom line is that this movie left me angry. not because it pretends to be real (who cares...gimmicks are allowed), or because the actors and dialogue are so lame (is this an unusual event in horror movies?) or even because the movie is so bad (and i am being polite here). what really got me mad is that the film is not only a rip off of bwp, but also a half-hearted lazy rip off at that.i don't believe in sacred cows and if they thought they could outdo bwp then kudos to them, but they didn't even try. the movie was made with little effort or care and that is the most unforgivable sin in horror (or any) movie!

i think that a lot of friends of people who acted in this thing must've come on and rated it because i'm telling you, its just awful. the acting is worse than soapopera bad, the effects are like something you'd see out of a 1970 episode of doctor who, the story is, well, there is no story. and they keep using the same 2 minute song over and over and over again. and the werewolf? its like the muppets they used in wing commander, the giant cats, remember how bad they looked? the werewolf is that bad. seriously, the guy who directed this thing is terrible and should never get to direct anything else again, except maybe his son's school play, but even then, he should have to pay the audience to see it. ghostwolf is nothing but a bad joke.

this is a semi fictional memoir of an "international man" who have witnessed various political upheavals in recent 30 years.i was hoping that this film would offer unique insight into politics and war. i was also hoping that it would be touching and affecting. however, i was disappointed by this film. "chico" seemed fragmentary, with the main character, ricardo, staying in one country for 10 to 20 minutes. as could be expected, no detailed storyline could be elaborated in such time frame. the excuses of him moving to another place were often perfunctorily explained. the result was a disappointing collection of fragmented clips shot in various countries.

"the death of a performer at a broadway stage play brings a theatre critic and a police detective together as an unlikely crime-solving duo. the dead performer's niece becomes not only the object of affection for our critic, but also a prime suspect in this death, and some other murders that occur at the theatre. 'the phantom killer' sets his sights upon the young woman as his next victim; so, it is a race against time for our heroes to catch the killer," according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis.milton raison's screenplay puts a little spark in this low-budget mystery whodunit. helpfully, dave o'brien (as anthony "tony" woolrich) does well in the lead role; his skills as an actor appear to be much greater than the productions employing him. o'brien and cab driving sidekick frank jenks (as egbert "romeo" egglehoffer) would have made a fine 1950s tv detective team. leading lady kay aldridge (as claudia moore) and the supporting cast are also good. unfortunately, the story becomes meandering, and anti-climactic.**** the phantom of 42nd street (5/2/45) albert herman ~ dave o'brien, kay aldridge, frank jenks

films about the mundane are often the most interesting of all films to me, in the hands of an insightful artist who examines all the twisted little details of the mundane. the french cinema seems to often be very good at this sort of thing, and i love the french cinema.this film was about the mundane. it didn't have a much of a plot. it was just characters who lived in a town, very normal people, and stuff just happened. but it wasn't very interesting stuff, and it wasn't examined very insightfully. the film did capture a bit of a mood, but it wasn't a particularly captivating mood. and while i can't think of much that the film did specifically wrong, it failed on just about every level to do anything right.there were a lot of characters in this film. a lot of them kind of looked alike, so it was hard to figure out who was who, and what were their relations to one another. i don't mind putting some effort into understanding a film, or even watching an especially complex film more than one time to iron out the details, but this one was a puzzle not worth the solving for me.the only good thing i can really say about this film is that the cinematography was pleasant--functional, not brilliant, but pleasant. the camera often captured some nice postcard-type shots. but it rarely found the really interesting little details.i've seen a handful of not-so-good films so far at the seattle international film festival, but this was the only one that failed to get any applause when the credits rolled. i sensed a big collective sigh of relief when the film was finally over. but i suppose there are probably some people out there who would like it.4/10

screen treatment of the comedic broadway success "the gay divorce" (a title which was considered too scandalous for american moviegoers, though it was used in the u.k.) concerns a man and woman (fred astaire and ginger rogers) meeting under embarrassing circumstances while she's in the process of divorcing her spouse; they dance, argue, make up, dance, argue some more and dance some more. betty grable is very appealing in a brief bit (singing and dancing in the number "let's k-nock k-nees" with overtly sissified edward everett horton), but the star-couple looks distressed and unhappy throughout. the surroundings are screwball-sophisticated yet the characters are not more than one-dimensional. *1/2 from ****

why isn't this movie on the bottom 100? raptor is, without a doubt, the worst movie i have seen in all of my fifteen years of life. i have never before witnessed such a catastrophic mess as this. absolutely everything about it is awkward and cheaply done.nobody in the cast gives a somewhat decent performance. the dialogue is utterly incoherent and the humor is anything but humorous. corbin bernsen was the most painful part of the whole thing. i can't help cringe when i recall some of his lines, like "in or out? you're worse than a cat!" and "your lady friend isn't a very good poker player. she's just revealed her hand."the raptors are a joke. even i could make more realistic dinosaur effects than these filmmakers have shamelessly done. it is an insult to the actual velociraptors, or any dinosaur for that matter. not only that, but the killing scenes are too gruesome even for me. i don't seriously think these animals would rip their victim to shreds and throw pieces all over the ground just to make everything look gorier. besides, the blood and guts are all useless when you can see the deaths coming from miles and miles away.i am a big fan of jurassic park movies and of dinosaurs. maybe the filmmakers didn't anticipate anybody with a shred of intelligence or sense to disregard bad filmmaking to stumble upon this movie on hbo late at night, like i did. if i could say one thing to anybody involved in this film, i would have to quote dr. alan grant from the first jurassic park..."just try to show a little respect."

a gut-ripping baby t-rex is on the loose in a small western town, prompting sheriff eric roberts and animal control agent melissa brasselle (who walks through her role in a very disinterest fashion) to get to the bottom of things. they discover that a mad scientist (corbin bernsen) is, unbeknownst to the government sponsorship, continuing on with a long-abandoned us research project called operation jurassic storm (ha!) by creating an army of dinosaurs in a secluded underground lab facility. before long, our heroes become trapped inside, the marines are called in, the power goes out and the dinos are set free to make a quick lunch of everyone they can get their claws and jaws on.despite an often infuriatingly inept script full of plot holes, character inconsistencies and loose ends, this direct-to-video copy of jurassic park and carnosaur is fairly digestible trash, thanks to good production values, passable fx, the occasional laugh and plenty of brainless action.someone pointed out that an opening scene in this film was stolen from carnosaur, but anyone used to watching roger corman productions knows he allows directors to liberally reuse clips from his early films to save both time and money.score: 3 out of 10

i understand that roger corman loves to do things on the cheap, but this is just sad. i purchased this flick from the dollar bin at my local video store not a month after watching the original carnosaur. i was blown away; it was the same damn movie, with just some corbin bernesen spliced in! it reminded me of all of those 80s ninja movies that took old kung fu movies and spliced in a bunch of white ninjas running doing cartwheels with the word "ninja" written on their headbands (if you haven't seen them, check out "ninja terminator", "the thundering ninja", "black dragon" and "ninja warriors"). thanks roger corman; you just made me waste a dollar.

this movie doesn't even deserve a 1/10 this movie was a scam.i swear that at least 30 minutes of the film were deliberetly copied from carnosaur 1, 2, & 3.the whole movie "raptor" was based of the movie and that was really a pathetic attempt to be a "thriller, action packed, dinosaur" copy. i loved that movie series and seeing it be put on a movie that cant even afford or willing copy it without doing there own models is what america is coming to.i recommend you see the carnosaur movie first (all of them) and then watch this, and you will know what i mean.- spencer

ok, lets get one thing straight, i love dinosaur movies, even the bad ones. so with this in mind lets proceed. "raptor" is a truly awful film, in fact its not even a film in its own right as it is cobbled together from bits of "carnosaur", "carnosaur 2" & "primal species - carnosaur 3". there is some new footage with eric roberts as a sheriff and his busty sidekick running around looking confused, frightened or whatever it is there trying to convey (badly) on the emotional scale but then how can they react to something that was filmed several years earlier. the producers (yes roger corman i'm talking about you!) even went to the lengths of hiring 2 people from "carnosaur" to play bit parts so there grisly death scenes can be reused! so this film is the cheapest of the cheap. watch the 3 original movies, there no oscar winners but they have some meritt and entertainment value but avoid "raptor". oh, it also has the most pointless sex scene that runs for nearly 10 minutes! do you think they were trying to pad out the running time?

the storyline of this movie is cliché and obviously has been ripped off from jurassic park. the filmmakers didn't even try to hide that. it seems as though there was not enough budget to make decent dinosaur-dolls, so instead the viewer sees some robot-like toy-dinos (from a cheap toystore) which move in a very unnatural way. it's funny though, because it's so bad. the acting is almost as unnatural as the dinos are. no one seems really excited to be in this movie (which i totally understand). especially the last half hour is extremely boring and it's almost impossible to watch it without falling asleep. the one positive comment note i'd like to make about "raptor" is that it doesn't take a full 90 minutes.

so i was sick with the flu one saturday and the silver lining was that scifi channel was having a marathon of dinosaur movies that day - the "carnosaur" trilogy, "pterodactyl," "raptor island." then i flicked ahead on my cable remote to see which movie scifi placed in its glamorous, saturday prime-time slot. some movie i had never heard of before called "raptor." i was pretty excited. the movie begins with some teens driving around in a jeep, when they get stalked and killed by a velociraptor. i was like, "hmmm, that's odd, that looks almost exactly like a scene in "carnosaur," except it was in the middle of that movie." then i sat through some really bad acting and then some guy was suckered into walking into an underground research laboratory where he got eaten by a ferocious t-rex. now i'm like, "wait a second, that was also a scene in "carnosaur." then, after i saw some scenes blatantly ripped off from "carnosaur 2", i figured out just what the hell was going on. so basically, roger corman & co. ripped off scenes from the "carnosaur" trilogy to use as the action scenes, weaved in a basic "dinosaur-runs-amok" plot, and tried to pass it off as an original movie. shameful. i don't know who i'm more angry at, roger corman or scifi channel for trying to pass this off as worthy of the prime-time slot. the only reason why this was worth watching to its conclusion was to pick out the actors/actresses who looked like their counterparts in the "carnosaur" trilogy and guess which scenes would be lifted next. as much as it pains me, being a dinosaur lover, i have no choice but to give this the lowest possible rating because i feel completely ripped off.

we all know that the world is full of dodgy, rip-off horror films. some of these can be fun to watch, due to their stupidity, awful effects and iffy dialogue. but raptor, which could have been in the same league as the equally pointless carnosaur series, does not even attempt to have any enjoyment in it. its so poorly done, it is really unbearable, even if your just watching it with the intentions of having a no-brain day at home. where do we start? well... the sets are pretty drab. my old drama group created more realistic stages. the genetics labs look like they are from a university, and it looks equally unbelievable on the outside (even for cover-up, why would you place yourself near civilisation where people can easily hear the dinosaur roars), whilst the doctors ward just doesn't look believable at all. next up in the complaints list is the creature effects; well, what can i say? absolutely pitiful. also, i think it's worth mentioning, the woman's tits should be mentioned as an effect. both of the main female characters have so obviously had boob-jobs, and it brings the characters down, being one female is a respected member of police, whilst the other is the sweet, "innocent" daughter of the towns sheriff. the acting, though, is by far the worst tragedy. eric roberts can be excused for at least trying a bit to give his role something. thats where it ends. corbin benson should have killed his costume designer for making his lacklustre performance look even more pathetic, whilst the female lead looks so bored (though, with this film you could let her off). the other character i'll point out is the daughter, who lets her tits do all the acting in the "raunchy" sex scene (ten minutes of endless re-run shots of her bouncing on top of some bloke).all in all, and summed up as one. don't bother, just don't.

i bought a dvd collection (9 movies for 10 euros) where this one was included. it turned out to be the "uncut version" whatever that means. beside the low average quality and short scenes there was one thing that was really strange - the soft sex scene. it started with a close up of 2 bigger breasts. after around 2 minutes i had an expression on my face which fitted the term "boooooooooooooring!" quite perfectly. 7.5 minutes of not even bouncing concrete like tits (at this point the term breasts is a bad choice) is far beyond from entertainment.the rest of the movie was more like "people aren't /that/ stupid, are they?" lucky me, the dvd was scratched and i got my money back.

the defining scene to this movie is when the fat guy quits,but the evil doctor just gives him one more duty,check on the dinosaurs.keep in mind that he no longer has this job and so is absolutely not getting paid for this.also keep in mind it's a goddamn dinosaur and the doctor he's supposed to trust is evil and doesn't like him.but he's still like,yeah okay.that just defined the stupidity in this movie.one melissa brasselle proves that seriously anyone can bolt on some breasts and be in movies.i can go ride a mountain-bike between them,but hey aside from that the people of paraguay are very nice.eric roberts gives his absolute worst performance so far,there's no adjective to describe how bored he is throughout.corbin bernsen saves what there is to save and you start rooting for him,but they have to stick to the formula of course.and i wonder how much your life sucks when you play like,one of the army guys in this one?how low can your acting career go?the special effects are so embarrassingly bad you expect a sign saying "studio 3" to get into the frame.it's not even honest pulp,it's all taken from "carnosaur",which even sucked all by itself.and then i wonder why just anyone is allowed to make a movie.

the biggest and most disconcerting things of the raptor movie was ending for the tyransaurus is identical to carnosaur except kid in the loader was a bit better acted and action then the adult. the similarities to the carnosaur movies was rather poor choice in plot line. the only thing that approached good was the beginning with the kids in the jeep. then the plot went down hill from there. would have been nice if a different plot had been devised, rather then cloning the earlier movies. the raptor movie should have taken lesson from jurasic park series in various plots. the only movie that has come close to a good dinosaur movie most recently is aztec rex. the repeated scenes as if taken from the carnosaur movies leaves a person thinking of those movies.

first of all, i would like to clarify that i consider this one of the funniest films i have ever seen. i have watched it almost 10 times just because i've wished to spread the deliciously tasteless innards of this film to other unsuspecting victims. it has the captivating essence of a hand-held camera recording of a distant nephew's seventh birthday. it has all the writing of a wwe match. and most of all, it has the consistency of a face scraped along a sidewalk. this movie is a masterpiece.the film begins with an almost instantaneous mutilation of three, drunken teens in the desert. this scene convinced me that i was onto something big when i picked this film from the dvd rack (being drawn to the box because of the graphic of a velociraptor yelling the word "raptor" on the front of it). the scene contains such treasures as tomato sauce, spaghetti intestines, vain attempts at humour and rubbery dinosaur puppets that repeat throughout the course of the movie. this movie is a masterpiece.the film contains erratic backdrops and prop use that causes one's mind to melt at the thought that someone could just have so little shame when it comes to creating a film. an example is when a truck, in the middle of the night, is parked beside a cliff wall. the very next day, they find it in an open grassy area. the driver couldn't have driven it there since he had his face bitten off by an unnamed bipedal carnivore (i will explain why it's unnamed in a second). so, my only guess is that either the velociraptor drove it, the livestock the driver was transporting did it, or jim wynorski doesn't think very highly of his viewers. hell, in one part they expect me to believe that they are walking down a main street at night when the road doesn't have gutters, the fire hydrant is precariously placed next to a phone booth, and there's only a single street light. yet, still, i feel compelled to watch and re-watch this film, just so i can find more things that will make me giggle the next time i watch it. this film is a masterpiece.the directing on this film is horrific. long extended pauses. strange cuts to characters that weren't even in the general vicinity of the conversation. people discussing things casually while facing the camera (and in turn, making them face the wall). they can't even give the dinosaur a coherent species, flipping between calling it a baby dinosaur and using a rubber velociraptor puppet (distinguished by the intensely long, fat, disproportionate claw). this film is a masterpiece.the editing is prominent on this film. this is not a good thing. i am well aware that the film is a collection of scenes from other films, masterfully crafted into a single piece of crap, but there has to be a limit! sub plots end as abruptly as they began. explanations for the sudden disappearance of characters not being limited to, well, not being explained at all! and an ending that felt like driving a muscle car into a brick wall without a seat belt. you just never know what is going to happen because the film doesn't follow a coherent structure. this film is a masterpiece.now, i'm going to just have to mention a single scene (the greatest one) that occurs near the end. this is a spoiler, but not really. the final scene contains a showdown between tyrannosaurus rex and sheriff tanner. it is like the showdown between sigourney weaver and the alien queen in aliens, except without all the emotional power/budget/epic battling. it pretty consists of tanner ramming the dinosaur with a piece of construction machinery. a white bobcat. in a space of several minutes, through a series of sneakily slipped in cuts, the director manages to turn that white bobcat into a yellow forklift/crane looking piece of machinery. now, as i said, i know that this film is made from scenes from other films, but what two films warrant a showdown with a t-rex in a construction vehicle? this film is a masterpiece.this film gets a 1/10 for quality of film making, but a 10/10 for how much it makes me laugh and enjoy myself.

this movie is an abortive, stillborn attempt to stitch together several bad movies and make some sort of extra-bad movie. it fails at even this, since there's way too much "plot", and not nearly enough goofy puppets and ridiculous gore. seriously, the puppets are sweet, and the guys in suits crack me up pretty good. the performances are c-grade at best and lame throughout, with special props to the spec-ops guy who spoke some sort of bizarre east coast/venusian dialect that was almost impossible to decipher. not that you really care what he says, as only the curse words are distinct. cinematographically, it's non-offensive, pretty much what you'd expect from low-rent straight-to-video offal (just like the script). the fact that new concorde used footage from the "carnosaur" films is offensive, and quite confusing. for shame, new concorde. for shame. "carnosaur" is one of my favorite terrible movies, and they somehow screwed it up and made it nigh unwatchable. see the "carnosaur" films if you want to see shoestring dinosaur mayhem.i give it one star because i am so fond of the movies it steals from, and also because the scale doesn't have a zero.

oy vey... jurrasic park got corman-ized. as usual the plot is wafer thin, from 1 foot tall dinosaurs that weigh 150 pounds and leave tracks bigger than they are, to inexplicable science which uses lasers to keep the dinosaurs in check and poultry trucks which have chickens loose in cages large enough for big dogs (i've seen chicken trucks they are all in cages the size of shoe boxes). and all that is in the first 15 minutes of this disaster of a film. all the male actors are imbeciles (thinking a grizzly might be loose in the desert, constantly dropping items to give the raptor an easy kill) and the female actors all look like they just came from a modeling shoot for fredrick's of hollywood. the raptor itself is the worst thing since the hobgoblins (from the movie of the same name), it looks like they had a hand puppet version and a plastic model for the "motion" shots. if you want a good movie to sit around and heckle mst3k style, this is gold. if you want competent film making and good acting... don't watch a roger corman film. acting gets a 4 out 10, some of the players upon this stage did try. story gets a 2 out of 10, it reads like a drunken storytelling session gone bad. special effects gets a 2 out of 10, i've seen worse, but not many.

**********spoiler alert***************if you happen to like jurassic park 1, 2, or 3:if you happen to appreciate really bad movies for their sheer entertainment value if not for their quality (case in point-john carpenter's dark star-highly recommended)if you happen to like movies about dinosaurs in general-then stay away from this cinematic crapsterpiece!the shameless use of stock footage from carnosaur 1 & 2 make up most of this miserable attempt at a dino/slasher flick- take the scene, for instance, where the security guard meets his doom at the jaws of the alpha t-rex. for some reason, he drops about 50 pounds and appears 10 years younger. why is that? simply because this scene was lifted directly from carnosaur, which was a crummy flick to begin with.the ending was a carbon copy of carnosaur 2, for those unfortunate enough to have sat through that straight-to-video loser. again, we see mr. rex do battle against a bulldozer-which alternates as a forklift truck-through the miracle of -ta-daa!- stock footage from the aforementioned carnosaur 1 & 2. of course, the ending is exactly the same-the beast falls to his death just as the complex goes up in flames.a real insult to anyone's intelligence.but it's still better than watching the rosie o' donnel show.rating: 1/2* out of *****

the worst film ever, with characters from carnosaur 1-3 inserted merely to fall to the same demise that they had in the first film, so that footage and special effects could be reused.stay away from this debacle.corman is ruining his legacy. he made and produced some amazing films - but that era ended with carnosaur being his last "creative in its badness" film.

on the bright side, it ended. that's the only thing this movie has going for it, of course.this is the worst movie i have ever seen, and i've seen some bad ones. this movie is actually so horrible, i went and changed my rating for children of the living dead to a 2 just for not being raptor.official one-liner rating: "come with me to another movie if you want to live."

this movie is sad. according to my fellow imdb users, (*spoiler*) raptor uses stock footage from the carnotaur films. well, since i have not seen the carnotaur movies, i cannot say. but, i do notice some pretty bad editing and even worse acting. this movie is one big steaming pile of s***. it makes absolutely no sense. here is this thing that calls itself a plot: mad scientist re-creates raptors. raptors kill people. sheriff investigates. *spoiler* (although i don't know what it is that i'm spoiling) sheriff catches on to mad doctor's plans. army guys are sent in and raptors start killing army guys. raptors. yeah, right. i could make a clay figure that looks more real. the fx are the cheapest ever used in a movie. there is a lot of gore. cheap gore. it doesn't even look real. i will agree with another person who rated this movie that the only thing this movie has going for it is the fact that it ends. there are about two seconds of originality in this film. and that only comes from when the sheriff is talking to some tax agent on the phone about his electric bill or something. this idea has been used in about 100,000 other movies with 100,000 different names. overall, i'm gonna give raptor 1/5 just because it ended.

uwe boll slips back in his film-making skills once again to offer up a scifi horror tale of mercenaries and reporters taking on super soldiers on a remote island. an okay cast headed by the excellent udo keir is cast adrift by boll who makes the worst of script that should have worked. the mad scientist being investigated by a reporter has been done to death but this script is amusing enough that the plot should have worked, additionally the effects and super soldier design with their dead lifeless eyes have some degree of creepiness, however boll somehow manages to film everything in an off handed way. its as if he couldn't be bothered to actually figure out what would work and instead rattled off stock camera placements and walked away. additionally the assembly of scenes has no spark or life, i'm guessing that boll only shot one or two takes and just used what he had. it really stinks. clearly boll is in one of his periodic retrograde films where anything he's ever learned about film gets flushed. the last film he made that was this bad was seed a serial killer movie that is one of the worst films i've ever seen. this isn't that bad, but it is close simply because it should have been better. then again udo keir is good enough that he does make watching his scenes worth the effort and make this a an almost so bad its good film. i'd take a pass unless it's late at night and you're catching it on cable.

i don't really mind the creative ideas interjected in these movies, but seriously. there isn't one coherent part of the game in this movie. that seems to be the trend, buy the rights and then just make a movie that has zero to do with what the fans want. this butchering is almost entertaining because you know you are getting away with hiding behind a lack of skill, and control of money (not yours) that allows you to do this. play a game, or hire someone to, and please make a real movie, or stand in the boxing ring and have your butt handed to you as you so claim won't happen.wow, 9 lines of text and i was done. had to add blah to bug you, sorry

i am deeply disturbed by some posts i am reading on the message boards for this movie, people saying it is actually a good movie! just because this movie is uwe boll's best to date does not make it a good movie at all, no way in hell! far cry is a clichéd mess full of bad acting, poor direction, and an uninspired story with a shoddy script. this is boll's first pure action movie, and news flash people, action movies aren't too hard to make because for a basic action flick all you need is explosions and gun battles scattered around a flimsy plot, and hey, mr. boll succeeds in doing that. house of the dead, alone in the dark, and bloodrayne, all horror games adapted into movies by boll are far worse than this (they have no redeeming qualities). far cry boasts two things which make it his best yet: two good leads and a couple of well-done action sequences. til schweiger is quite good as jack carver, and emmanuelle vaugier is a strong female lead. the usually great udo kier is passable as the clichéd villain and the supporting cast are pretty damn bad. towards the end of the film there is a surprisingly tense chase sequence which came as a shock considering boll was behind the camera.unfortunately the rest of the movie has an incredibly cheap feel to it, with bad cgi, lame one-liners and clichés around every corner. oh, and the worst lead up to a sex scene i think i have ever scene. not only have the two only known each other for six hours, but all it takes is for him to say he kept warm while in the army by spooning his fellow soldiers. he already got her to take his clothes off by merely telling her to. then he took his off and climbed into bed because he was afraid of hypothermia.anyway, to summarise, this is a bad movie. it is mindless action movie that can kill 80 minutes if you are totally bored. one could probably do worse than popping this in and watching it, but i'd personally say watch a classic action film like die hard or predator and stay away from this derivative mess.1½/5

there is only one reason this movie is watchable. till schweiger. he is such a good actor the movie isn't completely terrible. uwe boll please take up another career. the special effects and action are acceptable. all other aspects were very disappointing. all i can say is that kevin smith (an evening with...) talked about tim burton not ever reading the batman comics and it showed. uwe boll must not have ever played the video games that he keeps making movies about. if you two ever want to know how it is done go see andrzej bartkowiak. doom was one of the best video games to film adaptations ever. some people may disagree, but if you watch the movie you can see that the guys at id had a lot to do with doom. it doesn't seem like anyone at ubisoft was even near this production.

one of bolls better attempts. just shows that if you do something long enough you have to improve just by chance. it is still not good but it is at least watchable which is an improvement over the bloodrayne. the main difference between bloodrayne and farcry really is that the story from farcry wasn't the games strong point whereas bloodrayne had a strong story and thus boll had more chance to mess it up.the action in this movie is actually fairly good. occasionally a touch overdone but in a good way and worth a watch just for that.acting wise it was pretty decent. most of the actors are pretty good but you can tell they aren't taking it seriously based on comparisons with other performances. but the lighter mood this gives to the film actually helps.while i think sticking a little bit closer to the story of the game might have made for a slightly better film the changes made are pretty practical and not big enough to make a difference. especially given the plot of the game was hardly oscar winning just a vehicle for fps carnage. would have liked it set in the jungle as that was a pretty integral part of the game but canada doesn't have a great deal of jungle and it is at least set in a kind of rainforest.why boll feels the need to change already professionally scripted and directed game plots i don't know but he does. and until he starts letting the source material speak through his adaptations will always be lacking. watch the film for a laugh its good for that and maybe for watching during a party as drinking party fodder.

mr. "uwe fail" strikes again, transformed a classic game in a cheap piece of crap. poor acting; poor directing; awful adaptation; i mean, far-cry game was awesome, its like a true fps game, cool weapons and lots lots lots of "point and shoot". in the movie we had nothing compared to the game.. well we had some of the "point and shoot" thing but... i don't know how to explain, but if you ever watched another "uwe fail" movie you will understand. if you don't believe me, go to the website "petition online" and do a check for one named "stop uwe bowl".that movie made my eyes bleed, someone must stop him for once.don't waste your time.

i was one "chosen" to see this movie in a sneak preview.first you should know that this film is based on the video game "far cry", a for its time really good game (2004). second you should know that the regisseur of this flick is the great uwe boll. this is a man, who takes video games (dungeon siege, bloodrayne, postal, etc.) and makes movies out of them (very horrible ones....).i still remember when i saw boll's "the king's swords: a dungeon siege tail". there were so horrible mistakes in this film (like 3 scenes playing at the same time, 2 at day-time, and one somehow at night.....)so lets come to "far cry". if you expect cool action, forget it. really cheap tricks and a plastic helicopter are far away from real action. if you expect a cool story, forget it. orientating by the not-so-bad story of the game, this movie is a laugh. the actors' playing makes the movie in a lot of moments funny, but in a no-good way.i had the chance to see this movie for free. so do not do the mistake and pay for this trash. its one of my favorised flicks for the bottom 100.!!!!

glenn ford, a new york boy who has been saving his cash, thumbs and hobos his way to the arizona ranch he has bought, where he hopes to find heaven with a barbed wire fence.a film with a dalton trumbo script and story, directed by villain extraordinaire ricardo cortez, and starring the frequently twitchy glenn ford and the restless richard conte just shouldn't be so bloody nice. though the system -- mostly seen as mean cops and railroad bulls and real estate con men -- is as awful as one might expect from the leftish mr. trumbo, every single proletarian is just so sweet and nice and salt of the earth that one feels nausea. it doesn't help that the heroine -- a sweet blonde thing who is an illegal alien refugee fleeing franco's spain -- is annoying for reasons of both scripting and acting.so why watch? richard conte, in his first role, already has his persona and a pretty good part. and there are some moments of 30s leftist camp that are pretty astonishing. (did dalton absolutely have to set a major portion of the movie in the russian worker's mission? all that was missing was a portrait of a beaming joe stalin!) also, this is glenn ford's first substantive role (though his performance isn't good).why not watch? essentially, the movie offers an unconvincing vision, is wedded to a political viewpoint that is risible, and the two leads have made much better movies. also, the strengths of dalton trumbo as a screenwriter are nowhere in evidence. instead, we get a film that the coen brothers barton fink could have written in a flash (and avoided that hellish bout with writer's block).

a total and utter travesty of a movie.'dark power'is the kind of film even troma would be embarrassed to release.the script,direction,acting and action sequence's are so dire as to be almost painful to watch and one cant help thinking that it's mere 75 minute running time could have been better spent. the above reviewer must be related to the director as that's the only reason i can see for his/her appraisal of this rubbish,some might call it b-movie fun or 'so bad it's good' just to excuse there enjoyment of it,but when the lead actor ( and most experienced cast member) cant deliver his lines convincingly you know you've got a very,very bad movie.avoid at all costs.

when a group of dumb kids (including an unlikable. racist bitch) stay at an old house, it awakens four murderous toltec spirits. can lash la rue save the day? will you be able to watch until the end due to the horrible comedy on display."the dark power" is the kind of really bad horror/comedy hybrid troma used to release regularly. thing is, they didn't. release this. that doesn't excuse the whole thing, as it has a dreadful synthesizer score (including bad attempts at native american music and even worse "comedy" music), bad make up effects (basically halloween masks), and atrocious acting (ok, the fat guy was alright, though everyone else is terrible, and la rue, a western movie vet, seems embarrassed to be there-not that i blame him really.)the worst thing though, is the comedy aspects. sure, dumb teens is one thing, but when the movie keeps talking about the toltec spirits as if they are the ultimate evil, only for them to turn out to be horribly annoying, bumbling fools, all hope is dashed. combining horror and comedy takes at least some skill. there is no skill on display here, as it all is just stupid, and not "so dumb it's fun" either. i mean "smoking pot and listening to bad punk rock aren't i dumb" dumb.not even a decent ripped off face and a chick in little clothing can save this disaster. terrible movie, and not even worth a rental.

don't bother to check for logic. there is none. but on the other hand, there are many really great movies that totally lack logic, so why bother?i both like and dislike this film. i like it because the action sequences in the air are really great, you get to see a lot of dogfighting. i also like the f-16, which is a very cool plane.but there are just too many goofs to make me really enjoy it. i guess it's not fair to wish for some sort of continuity, as it is hard to make a really good fighter film - but i also think there should be some sense of reason.and i have a question: do they fly from california to the middle east in f-16s without air refueling? i'd like to see that happening.

i have rarely laughed so hard at a movie. notice that i laughed at iron eagle, not with it, because this is probably the stupidest film i have ever seen (with the obvious exception of sci-fi monstrosity cybertracker). you should also remember that this film is not a comedy!even overlooking the preposterous plot (the idea that a 16-year-old could walk into a us air force base, steal an f-16, fly to the middle east and kill about a thousand people without anyone noticing is beyond belief), the film is full of ridiculous action scenes that make little or no sense. for example, at various points, doug masters uses a machine-gun on his plane to shoot a steel girder, a control tower, and a tent. all of these things explode in a massive fireball. why? the enemy aircraft also explode in a strange way reminiscent of a paper aeroplane being blown up with a firework.on the plus side, i did actually enjoy this film. admittedly not in the way the makers probably wanted it to be enjoyed, but all the same i laughed at it and later bought the dvd. it's also improved by the awesome presence of david suchet as the evil terrorist leader (maybe you'll recall him as mustachioed belgian detective poirot?) overall, then, the film is a laugh and a light-hearted alternative to more serious fighter-plane movies like top gun. even if it is just as subtly homo-erotic (check out the man-hug between doug and chappy. something's going on between 'em!)

this movie is the proverbial 80s flick that shows the viewer that as long as he or she tries at something, they can be better than the pros. the main character, doug, showed off his skills in flying a cessna aircraft, which somehow equated to being fully capable of flying a jet aircraft and being able to kill people. we all would like to have a few million dollars to play with... maybe make a good investment, donate, buy a few things, but the directors of this movie decided to make iron eagle... not once... not twice... not even three times; yes, four times. the thing to look most forward to are the multitude 'hollywood endings' in this movie. just when you think the movie is going to end after a cheesy end sequence, there's another cheesy end sequence. then another. definitely a movie one must watch to believe... and maybe own just to remind oneself of how awesome the 80s must have been.

it's hard to believe that a movie this bad wasn't produced once, but four times! most movies require a certain `suspension of reality' to enjoy, but this one takes it just too far. the basic scenario is an air force pilot who is shot down over a `middle eastern' country. the us government drags its feet in recovering him, leading the pilot's son (doug masters) to attempt a rescue mission.the problem i have with the movie is that it depicts the us air force as one colossal joke. in the movie you'll find that doug and his friends on the air base manage to secure two f-16's, all the munitions, the fuel, the intel for the mission, and so on. security on this base seems to be a joke. nobody seems to have a problem that a sixteen-year-old kid is fully qualified to pilot an f-16!if that wasn't enough, you would think the producers would at least attempt to get the munitions right, since people like to see things `blow up'. not so! several times in the movie, doug fires off aim-9 missiles on ground targets. aim stands for `air intercept missile', meaning a weapon used to strike targets in the air. he also fires off 15-20 missiles, where the maximum an f-16 can hold is 6 aim-9's. the movie also lacks continuity. you'll see the aircraft configured with one set of munitions, and in the next scene, it has a totally different munitions package. also, 20mm doesn't just completely destroy anything it touches! an f-16 will hold 500 rounds of 20mm, and it's mostly used for self-defense.i could go on forever with plot holes, flaws, and outright wrong information from the movie, but i won't bore you. if you're in the mood to see a good air force movie, your choices are rather slim. most military movies deal either with the army, navy or marines. until hollywood can come up with an air force movie on the lines of `saving private ryan' or `a few good men', we'll be forced to watch movies like the `iron eagle' series.

as a retired usaf msg (aircraft maint. spec), this has got to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen. the fact that a teenager could ever get on the flight-line, much less get into an f-16 is ludicrous. the military spends millions on each pilot to make them the best in the world and this movie makes the air force and all its members seem stupid at best. yes, i know it is only a movie but it conveys a message to the younger folks that we are all idiots, and believe me, we are not. the logistics involved in setting up any type of mission are highly involved, even in the eighties, military computers were too secure to hack by any teenager, and the other flaws in this movie make peter pan more believable. sorry, to me, this movie has no entertainment value at all.

if you wish to have a truly traumatic experience, than this awful motion picture (if you may consider to call it that) is for you. a film worse than the postman,sizzle beach u.s.a, batman and robin, kazaam,fair game...well you get my point.this film directed by french television sensation patrick sebastien (jerry springer with an i.q of 25) can truly be considered the worst film ever made. i do hope that troma or someone in america would distribute it, so that the u.s.a can experience the french stench at it's worth.

to even say that this film is sebastien's work at his best just tell you everything you have to know on the man. sebastien is a pathetic, foolish, not amusing at best, yet highly popular host on french television. if watching any of his shows is just plain torture for any normally constituted human being, his first (ans lets hope only) film proved to be even worst. sebastien's apology of rape (the victim fall in love with her aggressor) is not only misplaced but plainly unacceptable. i highly suggest you not to bother taking a look at this picture (or any of sebastien's future features), you would just loose your time...there is something about french television that don't smell right...and this is patrick sebastien!!!

i wrote spoiler alert, but there's not really much that can be spoiled. it's like spoiling rotten meat. this movie is probably the worst i've ever seen. not because of the actors or the special effects, but because of the sheer number of mistakes, both factual and physical. first of all, the migs aren't actually migs at all. they're mirages, and they're french. and how the heck can doug's dad withstand the maneuvers his son makes to fight off the "migs" without a g-suit? and why would chappy try to board his plane without a g-suit? and how could doug defeat the enemy pilot ace with such ease? anyway, i did not like this movie. and the worst part is that it has 3 sequels, the latest one from as late as 1995. now that's scary.

the director of this movie is a famous french tv presenter, patrick sebastien. he likes music and humor for rednecks, and his incredible movie is absolutely in his image. it's the story of a young retarded person, called "zep" (sic). a night, he sees his sister's sm sexual relation, and decide to do the same thing: he rape the girl who he loves! zep is placed in a asylum, and his unlucky girlfriend in a clinic. one man will find them. one man will reunite them. this man is a psychologist. this man looks like a hell's angel. this man is... patrick sebastien! with an excessive use of clichés, we'll see how the absolute love can break all misunderstandings, and how a humanist doctor can force a victim to fall in love with her rapist. we'll also learn how using sandwiches in order to seduce a girl. not only patrick sebastien thinks that he can do better than one century of psychiatry, but he also impose us a silly left ideology; with the character of the father's girlfriend, a boss, who want to take away the feeble of his girl. distressing. but it's very pleasant to laugh at zep (mentally retarded persons are not funny, except in this movie.)

this thing, directed by french sensation patrick sebastien,is worst than all the turkeys that you may have seen. forget independence day, kazaam, the patriot, etc... you get the picture, this one's the pits. sebastien is a tv celebrity in france, (if you need an equivalent, let's say he's jerry springer with an i.q of 13), this is his first movie let's hope it's the last. i hope troma or someone would distribute this film in the states, so that you guys out there can excperience the french stench at it's worst. let's cut this short, this is the masterpiece of s**t.

this movie is bad. i saw the rated and the unrated versions. they are terrible!! now, i know it's suppose to be a low budget, porn spoof of spiderman, but spiderbabe is just not good at being bad-good. it's not funny! not funny at all!! i wanted to laugh. i tried to laugh. but this movie let me down. at least the unrated version has lots of nudity to look forward to. and is it me, because mundae is not a great looking woman. from the waist down she's okay, but on the way up leaves much to be desired. she does look good in that school girl outfit. please, if you must watch this spiderbabe, rent it first. rated or unrated, doesn't really make any difference, they're both bad to me!!

i loved this movie 10 years ago when i was about 16 years old. my biggest mistake was to watch it again, 10 years later. it's not the worst "i-wanna-be-a-pilot" movies ever, but it has so many flaws in it that you can hardly overlook them.queen's "one vision" (along with the rest of the soundtrack) makes this film better than the average patriotic nonsense you usually get to see ;)[****------]

i was pleasantly surprised with this one. it's actually quite interesting and engaging. the cast is strong, even dan cortese. brooke shields has come into her own as an actress. black and white must have really set her free, 'cause i have never seen her in this much command playing a conventional character. if marketed right, could be a medium-size hit.

brooke shields -- in a departure from her "suddenly susan" duties -- plays a bitter divorcee who embroils three girlfriends in a "girls only" weekend in palm springs. the problem: brooke is "unattached" and on the prowl, while her friends are all involved. hence the title implications and emotional backlash their "amoral" weekend causes.despite a few laughs generated by dan cortese ("victoria's closet") and mtv "relationship authorities" adam corolla and dr. drew pinsky, this is somber stuff for women only. d.b. sweeney, virginia madsen and jon polito co-star.

it's amazing that such a cliche-ridden yuppie angst film actually got made in the first place. the characters are so weak, and the acting so uninspired, that it's impossible to care about any of them-- especially brooke shields. the temptation to fast forward through the slow parts is almost irresistible. if you like this genre, you'd be better off renting "singles," or "bodies, rest & motion."

i like to think of myself as a bad movie connoisseur. i like to think that the films most people label as the worst of all time i can easily withstand.but...there are exceptions. i can only recall three movies i have had the misfortune to see that i have repeatedly used the fast-forward button for large chunks of the story. those movies are the mighty gorga, night of the seagulls, and this little crap, deep blood.in the world of jaws ripoffs, this falls off the scale. deep blood doesn't have the realistic storyline of the original crocodile, nor the incredible effects of the sea serpent, nor the commentary of tintorera. no, instead we are treated to a handful of teens from any random failed '80s public access sitcom battling bullies and the local sheriff.shark attacks are realized by quick cuts of documentary footage with actors thrashing about in the water, occasionally with a bit of what appears to be orange-ish paint thrown into the water. not a minute of original shark footage exists in this celluloid waste dump.normally, i, or somebody like me, would read a dismal review like this one and say "cool, i gotta find a copy of this!" that's the same thought i had when i read another viewer's review on this very site. how wrong i was.so...from one bad movie fan to another...let this collect dust on the shelf...grab up from the depths or the great alligator instead to satisfy your need for something evil lurking in the water.

zzzzzzzzzzzz. this one came directly from the "jaws" cookie-cutter mold, with some other bizarre cliches thrown in for good measure. i was interested in seeing this after finding a still from it in a book about italian horror films, and wow...i guess i got what i deserved!very slow-moving and talky, much of this killer shark movie takes place on land, which isn't really that surprising. it seems like the only method they had of showing a shark is through shots of a shark in an aquarium. the shark is never in the same frame as any of the actors, and that's too bad...most of the characters are so annoying that you actually wish they would get eaten.the "plot" concerns a group of four kids who meet up with a mysterious indian on the beach one day while roasting weenies. the indian, for some reason, gives them an ancient artifact that will allow them to track an ancient evil that assumed the form of a monster shark to attack their tribe...supposedly because they were too good at fishing the ocean and the ocean god was worried they would take all the fish. or something like that.it's a good thing too, because wouldn't ya know it...years later, a monster shark appears and starts gobbling up people in the sleepy seaside community. when one of the four guys are eaten by the shark, the remaining three are determined to kill the thing...especially since (big shocker here) the authorities have killed a shark and they think the threat is over. yawn.the obligatory death scenes are unbelievably tedious, and you can see them coming a mile away (my favorite was the girl who has a fight with her boyfriend while they're sitting in a van, then jumps out and says "i'm going for a swim," immediately to be gobbled up by the waiting shark). they had a lot of nerve calling this film "deep blood" since you hardly see any, just cloudy water. the actors handle their cliched roles like they're all thumbs, and there is even a hilarious subplot involving a greasy rocker-type bad boy who threatens our goody-goody heroes, then turns good in the end to help kill the shark.it took me a really long time to find this film, it is rather obscure, so i don't think there's any danger of too many people wasting their time on this. however, if you should be lured into it...don't say you weren't warned!

this is the worst italian movie ever, quite possibly the worst movie of all time! joe d'amato is of course no cinematic genius but many of his movies are interesting and watchable. unfortunatly this is not one of them. its cheesy and boring....waaaaay boring. if you want a movie to mst3k, get troll 2, if you want a movie to put someone into a coma, get deep blood!

this movie is crappy beyond any limits. it's incredible - a very bad ripoff from jaws and other (better) shark movies. a really bad one - everything is really pathetic. the story is purest crap, actors are bad, effects very cheap, no creativity whatsoever. it looks like some really debilitated children took jaws script and arranged it randomly, then its parents took their 8 mm camera and shot the movie with their neighbors. the music is really inappropriate, just some "elevator" music, bland and overly optimistic when nothing happens, then slightly less optimistic when shark is around or when children gets depressed (again listens to very loud elevator music). carlo maria (the author) should be so ashamed he should ask for his name to be erased from the titles!! the movie acts as perfect demonstration how crappy music will destroy ***any*** scene which is supposed to be thrilling. there is one major difference to jaws though: in the beginning of jaws there are comments about stupid people who try to kill shark with dynamite. well, there is an attempt to kill a shark with dynamite. when this does not work, guys take an ***big load*** of dynamite and spent like 1/4 of movie by placing explosives in some sunken ship. this is really original way to catch the fish i have to admit! they use so much dynamite like they would try to kill a battleship (i would guess bismarck class of battleship) or to dig another panama channel. this is just incredible. i'm glad they did not try to use napalm-flamethrower or tactical nuclear strike to eliminate this bad, bad approximately 2 m shark. well, there is mystic disappearing native indian (who looks like german pensioner) too in this mess. this is not a movie, this is a warning example how bad the movies may be! as a warning it is useful. but the public should be protected from this crap. most of italian movies is bad, but this... this is really exceptional in the worst sense of the word.

the jaws rip off is the trashiest of the all the italian 'genres', and director joe d'amato is second only to the great jess franco in the trash film production stakes. put the two together and what do you get? a gigantic piece of trash, of course. unfortunately it's not trash in the good sense of the word either, as deep blood delivers more in boredom than it does in hilarity. to the film's credit, it does actually attempt something bordering on a plot; but to take said credit away from the film - the plot is rubbish. it has something to do with a group of friends taking of an oath (of friendship) and then some indian curse that manifests itself into a shark. or at least i think that's what was going on. anyway, the majority of the film is padded out with boring dialogue and 'drama', and the shark itself - which lets not forget, is the only thing we really want to see - finds itself in merely a cameo role. or not even that since most the shark is actually stock footage! despite being a trash genre, there are actually a lot of fun jaws rip-offs; but with this one, joe d'amato makes it clear that he couldn't be bothered to even try, and the result is what must be the worst italian shark movie of all time. avoid this dross.

parrots? parrots? i have been around this old earth longer than most and have seen nearly all the westerns that have have produced. old west history is my passion. comanche moon is one of the most poorly produced, directed and acted stories i have ever seen. there was very little historical accuracy but then, it is obvious you were operating on a shoestring budget whichplayed a distinct roll in this insult to intelligence. i am happy that i tivo'd this show. it was bad enough having to sit and watch the movie plus put up with the inane commercials. once again, there was not one actor that came anywhere near convincing. i kept hoping it would improve as the three days progressed. wrong! i'm ashamed to say i wasted 4 1/2 hours of what precious little time i have left.

grosse pointe blank was really quite a below average film. its hit man theme is very dry and is more like a romantic comedy than a hit man thriller. the acting is very normal. the performances are extremely embarrassing at times with many characters seeming very 'eccentric' and that really annoyed me. the whole reunion and the 'wow, i haven't seen you in 10 years!' element is extremely cheesy and many scenes just drag on, especially nearer the end when they are at the actual reunion party and the characters are going through each of their former classmates one by one greeting them. it just all seemed very tacky, pointless and was poorly executed. dan akroyd's role as a 'rival' assassin is very sparse. he only seems to appear once at the very beginning and right at the very end in a 'final show down' which is hugely hyped up but doesn't deliver at all.the soundtrack is also very mediocre. the bulk of the songs that are in this film are straight out of the 1980's and with the exception of two or three, are very bad. hearing duff songs over quite a duff film just adds to the negativity that surrounds this film.i could go on and on about how little things were annoying and were just very bad such as the very few action sequences that came and went very quickly, the lack of character development and how poorly the whole thing was constructed in that department, the way that half the time you forget that cusak's character is even a hit man at all as the element is so non-existent.even the way the comedy thinks it's funny; but it isn't. i didn't laugh once during this movie. sure, maybe i smirked now and again but my only real feel good point was when i realised the movie was nearly over!please, don't waste your time with 'grosse pointe blank' despite the relatively high (but badly incorrect) imdb rating. i've seen films that are better than this film that have lower rating on this site which tells you that there are better films out there. just don't bother with this one.

i was shocked there were 18 pages of good reviews. this has to be one of the worst movies especially considering it was recommended. must admit that comedies are not my favorite genre, but this movie made it worst in that it tried so hard to be clever that it made me squirm to watch it.the concept of the movie is comparable to audition week on american idol. you watch because people are so blind to their shortcomings. but we knew this movie didn't have bad actors. so how funny would it be to have good singers try to convince they shouldn't get anywhere near an american idol tryout? it would be pointless as this movie was.the use of improv is over-rated. we've all been in that setting where a group of friends get on a roll and everyone is cracking up with tears in the their eyes. i feel that is improv. improv can't be turned on just because the camera is rolling as this film proves. if you like that drew carey hosted show of improv, you'll probably like this film.overall the jokes were poor, the improv was sophomoric, and the over-acting by guest and company was campy...and those are my compliments of this drivel. if a guy playing a trumpet and the kettle drum at the same time is funny to you, fine. for me, i prefer more heady stuff like "i love lucy" or "hee-haw".but remember, i think snl lost its humor in the 1980's, so maybe you'll like this g-rated humor. i kept waiting for a person to identify himself as the zoo keeper and then tell us there was no zoo in town. that's the humor you can expect.my only wish was that i could give this a minus rating.

just to let everyone know, this is possibly the worst movie i have ever seen, and i've seen pretty much everything. if you're thinking of renting it, don't!!! it's not worth the cardboard container that it came in....

college students (who are actually in their late 20's) on campus in boston (which looks strangely like the isle of man) are menaced by a fierce monster (assembled during a blue peter episode). the new teacher must save the day (even though he is really... oh, who cares?)i'll start with the positives... there is a nice shot of eastenders new gal samantha janus's can in the obligatory campus shower scene with her best mate katy lawrence. a bit of side trivia: katy was hired when she arrived at auditions with her sister, just as moral support to her sibling but ended up landing a part. oh, joy. picked from obscurity to... flash her pert buttocks in a meaningless scene added for titillation, then getting killed 30 minutes in for her troubles. her latest (and only other credited role) is as probationary nurse #5 in atonement. i wonder if she snuck a look at keira knightly (if extras and stars are allowed to mix) and wondered: where did it all go wrong?!i'll give a few hints katy: if all the other british cast members are asked to speak with american accents in a doomed attempt at mass-marketing, and the only person who can manage it is the b-movie veteran usa native todd jensen, you know you're in trouble. if you look at your wage slip and it'll only just about cover your lunch and your bus ride home, you ain't starring in a movie with a trillion dollar budget. if the premiere is attended by loads of family members of the fourth assistant director and provokes gales of laughter when the stickyback tape monster rampages through the sewers, it should dawn on you that this isn't exactly alien. or even a critters iv, come to think of it. so katy, in your next life (i'm a buddhist, you see) perhaps you'll be a bit more selective in your choice of debut feature rather than impulsively jumping at the first pile of crap that heads your way. flashing skin in your first movie does not guarantee long lasting success. unless you're sylvester stallone. and he had the script to rocky to back him up.to all intents and purposes this is as 0/10 a movie as i've ever seen. however, for sheer unintentional laughs and pure camp value, it gets a 1. well done ;)

this was a pathetic movie. the alien was decent, but the movie itself gave a new meaning to pitiful. the plot is something that's been done over and over again! however, this one does it the worst! the acting was c**p, the scenes were often too dark to get what was going on. no one developed any concern for the main character. the movie was far too slow paced, and the murder scenes that there were were foolishly crafted and ended up looking no more interesting than the rest of the movie. there are some movies which "suck" but can still be enjoyed because of there total outrageousness, but this doesn't even have that!! whoever made this film thought that they could make something good and they failed miserably. there is nothing this movie has to offer except a headache. avoid it!

after a meteorite lands in "boston" (really somewhere in the isle of man), a hideous, fanged alien monster is released and is on the loose in a local girl's school, causing mayhem and turning the students into zombie-like creatures. this film is apparently a loose (and i stress loose) remake of the 1986 film with the same name, as it features the same monster but a different plot. both films are terrible, but to the credit of the 1986 version, it was watchable. this isn't. let's start with all the problemsthe acting, especially from the lead professor, was very, very bad. this film is supposed to take place in boston (we know this because the film makers had the ingenious idea of putting "boston police" or "boston gas company" on everything), yet everyone seems to have rather muddled british accents (at least they didn't try using boston accents, thank god). the script is a big flawed mess. the best example of how dumb the writing is when it's established that you can turn the zombie-students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite. is that what our brave heroes do? no, they run around shooting the zombie-students instead. nice. director paul matthews, who also wrote/directed the weak 1995 monster movie "grim", clearly doesn't know how to pace his films. the movie is terribly boring in places. the lighting is awful. the film looks cheap and bland. one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore. 99% of the death scenes involve the creature popping out of a dark corner and dragging someone away, while we hear they're "horrified" screams off in the distance. this convention never worked well in the past, and certainly doesn't work here. the visual effects were awful. the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for god's sake! the "explosion" of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful. okay, i like to consider myself a fair critic, so i'll give credit where credit's due--the creature effects were actually pretty cool. gotta love those close-ups of slimy, drooling teeth!to sum the film up, "breeders" is a terrible, cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus. not recommended.1.5/10.

imagine the most cliche ridden b-movie horror plot you can. add more plot holes than plot. have it scripted by a 10 year old. have the acting done by a-level drama students faking really bad us accents (in the isle of man!) add monster special effects that the lovers of b&w dr who shows will appreciate. result: duff film. throw in samantha janus taking her clothes off (make a point of this on the cover) and you'll probably sell enough copies to make a profit anyway!

it's strange what fate does to some people. while looking in the discount bin at a dvd retailer, i came across a copy of deadly instincts. being a collector of any film that is either sci-fi, horror or featuring alien monsters, i decided to buy it (not to mention the fact that it cost five dollars  a bargain, believe me). after viewing it, i came to the opinion that it was nothing special. but after doing some research on the internet, i discovered that the film was actually called breeders & was a remake of the tim kincaid horror flick that menaced video stores in the mid-1980s. which i've already seen. my appreciation of "deadly instincts" grew following that discovery.a meteorite crashes on the lawn next to a private girls' college. the sole teacher there, ashley (played by todd jensen  that's right, the guy who gets turned into a cyborg in the cult flick cyborg cop four years earlier), notices that some of the students are beginning to disappear, while encountering a black-haired woman with a scarred face & wearing a kinky leather outfit. his investigation reveals that an alien creature had hitched a ride on the meteorite & had come to earth to breed using the local womenfolk. along with a local detective who believes him to be responsible for the disappearances, ashley tries to stop the monster.the original breeders, directed by tim kincaid (who would leave the genre to make gay porn), was a sci-fi / horror film which was actually a thinly-veiled soft-core porn film designed to take skin flicks to genre fans. it is, in my belief, one of the worst films made in the 1980s. why anyone would want to remake it is quite a mystery.this remake is actually a better effort than its low-budget source. the film, which takes the basic concept of an alien monster trying to interbreed with human women, eliminates any pornographic elements. in fact, the film is actually very tame. there are no sex scenes, no nudity (even during the shower scene), swearing & violence are kept to a minimal level & there is no gore (which may cheat gorehounds). this makes the remake a film safe for the whole family, that is if the kids aren't scared by alien monsters (which brings me to the film's m 15+ rating, which seems a bit much).tameness of subject matter aside, the film does have some faults. the script, while featuring some good characterizations, has a number of holes so big you can crash a meteor through.what? you're mad at me for that? come on, this review needed a bad pun so it will remain interesting.anyway, the film's setting is one problem the script failed to fix  the film is set in boston but the buildings don't look like they belong in boston. something about the architecture ain't right. another thing is the college itself, with a rather large building housing about twenty students (all female, of course) & only having one class  art. the only teacher there has a relationship with a student (& so does the janitor!), which somehow escapes the attention of the principal. not to mention the cops, who are so one-dimensional (& stupid) that the real boston pd would have a good case if they ever decided to sue. oh, & the meteor well the chance that a meteor which is sent from saturn (check the opening credits) reaches earth with no onboard propulsion is astronomical. that doesn't include the chances that any passengers in the meteor will survive the landing.as far as the acting goes, todd jensen gives a dependable performance as the heroic teacher while the late kadamba simmons (who was murdered by her boyfriend shortly before the film came out) cuts a striking figure in that leather outfit, as well as proving she can act. the visual effects are run-of-the-mill, with credits due to the filmmakers for bringing us a cool-looking monster.

dire beyond belief. obviously set on the isle of man masquerading as the us - very badly - and full of cut-rate british actors who can't do american accents. a monster that looks like an unarticulated promotional cut-out for alien from a movie store, with the most inflexible feet ever seen. girls in the shower, undressing, catfighting, blah, blah, blah. you get the idea. don't watch it, run away, hide, avoid.

of all the movies in the history of movies i can't imagine someone sitting down and saying, i want to spend x amount of dollars (or pounds sterling) to remake that flawed classic film called "breeders." lots of stories have been turned into films about meteors coming to earth with something sinister lurking inside. why not put your money into making a spectacular 3d remake of "it came from outer space" instead? why look for a dingy nudie flick that existed only for the purpose of showing off a rubbery set of monsters and some naked coeds? was the script for the 1986 version of "breeders" so inspiring that these producers felt it had to be done again and this time done correctly? when you come down to it, the only reason this film exists is to show off britcom cutie pie samantha janus. but if you're gonna make a skin flick and exploit sam janus in it, you'd better have her more naked than this and naked more often than this if you want to succeed.meteor lands ... monster escapes ... coeds duff their clothes ... monster eats people ... and another "what if?" ending ensues.honestly, i never thought i would ever recommend the original "breeders" over any other film but this would be the one to come in 2nd place to it.

i've read other hacks' reviews of this movie, and while it certainly isn't the best movie ever made in the sci-fi / horror genre, it isn't that bad if you accept it for what it is - low-budget, b-movie fare that (shall we say) "borrows heavily" from the likes of 'alien' (nasty extraterrestrial monster that cocoons its victims) 'species' (gorgeous and confused "space girl") and 'incubus' (the beastie-breeding-with-captive-girls angle). this is one seriously cheesy movie, and the whole thing was obviously done on a shoestring budget, although the alien isn't too bad (i've seen far less convincing men-in-rubber-suits at any rate). none of the acting is oscar material and the isle of man doesn't really double for boston massachussetts very convincingly. the plot is fairly predictable too and the premise that an alien craft would travel squillions of miles and crash land smack bang in the middle of an all-girls college campus - thus conveniently providing a rich source of perfect breeding victims - is utterly laughable. however, the movie does have its suspenseful moments, there's a few helpings of nudity and semi-nudity and the film does feature one of the few movie appearances by the beautiful and tragic model / actress kadamba simmons (as the "space girl") who, at the age of only 24, was murdered in london by her jealous boyfriend shortly after making this film.

oh but this is woeful. one good actor after another turns in lamentable dialogue in half hearted fashion under what must have been incredibly pedestrian direction to consider it acceptable. i like robert carlyle and joanne whalley is one of my favourite actresses, tom courtney can act well when pushed and david suchet is a professional of the highest integrity but they all wallowed around like fish in a barrel of watery gin. i swear courtney was inebriated, on painkillers or both. was there a good performance in the whole thing? well yes, david hood as the junior underground engineer whose mate got washed away looked like he was taking the thing seriously and credit to him for that, it can't be easy when "all around are losing theirs" so to speak, or maybe his scenes came under the direction of the assistant director ( if there was one) i just don't know what these people were doing in a film that was this poor ( other than paying the bills, obviously) i can't begin to say how disappointed i am in them. you should be ashamed of yourselves! any positives other than david hood the third... yes the aerial shots of london largely submerged were very well done and the effects artists responsible deserved better than to have their fine work punctuated by such a shallow story,if you'll forgive the expression, as those few people that do see them will do so on a far smaller screen than would be to best advantage. what's going on here? why are british film makers trying to imitate such characterless, spectacle driven, tabloid level genres as the disaster movie and then doing it even worse than the americans. gritty realism, character integrity, the capture of real emotion in a way that makes you feel it and care... the family way, spring and port wine, get carter, the long good friday, trainspotting....don't get me wrong i like a bit of escapist hokum. the real "italian job" , the adventures of tom jones; but oh that it should come to this, there was more realistic drama in carry on camping.

there's something intriguing about disaster movies. the simple, primal premise can lead to several great stories. granted, most disaster movies tend to explore familiar territory instead but i can usually live with that.unfortunately, flood probably marks the low point in the history of this sub-genre. robert carlyle is undoubtedly the star of the movie, even though screen time is split between different locations and characters. he gives a barely decent performance. as well, joanne whalley is very uneven. veteran actor tom courtenay (he played in doctor zhivago for heaven's sake) is particularly bad. i mean, his timing is completely off most of the time and his characterization is extremely poor. what an embarrassing performance for that man. the rest of the cast ranges from decent to really bad with one exception: jessalyn gilsig, whom i thought might be there as a plot device/eye candy gives by far the most convincing performance. doesn't mean much considering how bad everybody else is but still nice to see that she cared.the script is really bad, confusing and cliché. some of the worse lines i have heard in quite some time are delivered by the actors one after the other.you've seen this story a thousand times. it employs every dramatic hook and tear-jerkers you've seen in "outbreak", "armageddon", the poseidon movies (original and remake) and many others.the direction is awful. no sense of timing, nothing inspired. the shots are bland, dialog and action both fail to flow. editing is bad but how do you edit such a mess? without a doubt, this movie tried to rely way too much on (rather poor) cgi. the human factor, the drama and struggles of the characters are glossed over. scenes where the characters must actually face the flood are rare and poorly done. the made-for-tv feel gives nausea. some guy is supposed to go down a rope from an helicopter? no problem, let's show him inside a helicopter and make a really poor cut/editing job and have the next frame with him safely on the ground, in the most obvious way possible.the movie score is rather poor. all over the place, no timing.the ending is probably the worse i have seen in quite some time. very much like they ran out of ideas. scrap that, you can't run out of something if you never had it in the first place. must have ran out of budget.this is a really amateur job. i give it a 2 for using london as a location, which is a nice change, for gilsig being actually decent in a key support role and for the few cgi shots that were decent (those of the water closing in on london and the gates).do yourself a favor and check out day after tomorrow or just about any disaster movie before this one. this includes older classics like the towering inferno.

george and mildred is a truly unfunny film. this attempt to translate the successful tv series to the big screen was a dismal failure, as is so often the case.the wit and clever one-liners from the tv shows have gone missing. the plot is a typical english farce of confused characters and mistaken identities, which is neither funny enough nor weird enough to provoke many decent laughs.die-hard george and mildred fans might want to see this final episode of the pair's output (mildred died of hepatitis before the film was released), but others should invest their time more wisely.

george & mildred - the movie lacks the talents of its tv writer john mortimer who brings the close quarter cut and thrust of george's class war with the fourmiles alive.the plot is cut from standard spin-off cloth - hit-man/mistaken identity - and has as little tension as there are laughs. the producers should have taken a leaf from rising damp, (also 1980)which was also bought to the big screen after the tv series demise, and kept much of the story in familiar setting.yootha joyce died in 1980 but she should not be remembered for this creaking piece of work encumbered as she was by her illness. mildred lacks the sharpness of her tv incarnation; cutting asides and withering looks largely directed at georges lack of libido. george's sputtering incredulity also gets lost in the more expansive sets. this is not to say that they were much to shout about. the budget for this movies looks pathetically small; a restaurant they go to is clearly a new semi-starched house with some christmas lights adorning the front door.for fans of 70's british comedy or those who just want to revisit an old tv companion from their youth this film can add nothing to the experience and they should just stick to the first four tv series out now on dvd.

let me start by saying how much i love the tv series. the nature of class war was always going to be a subject worthy of poking fun at, but this tv series exploits it better than most. the chemistry between yootha joyce and brian murphy was always electrifying and the writers wrote almost entirely flawless episodes every time. in my opinion, it is the best british sitcom of the mid to late-1970s, surpassing the likes of rising damp, robin's nest, are you being served? and so on. with the on the buses series having finished a few years earlier, george and mildred became the next pride and joy of itv (or itv 1 as it's now known), enjoying a four-year run on the channel.the movie however is absolutely terrible in almost every respect. the general essence of the tv series has almost entirely been stripped by the writers of this abysmal movie (who anyone will immediately notice are not the same ones who worked on the series). as one commenter has already pointed out, mildred lacks the sharpness she had on the tv series and does not come across as anywhere near as overbearing.the plot, instead of focusing on the class war with the fourmiles that was the very foundation of the tv series, actually writes out the fourmiles almost entirely after the first half-hour. the plot, if you can call it that, consists of george and mildred going on holiday to some hotel and getting mixed up with gangsters. first rate talent in the form of stratford johns, kenneth cope, david barry and sue bond are all wasted here. most of these are well past their heyday and all of them look very embarrassed as if they very well know that the only thing worth hanging around for is a paycheck (which probably won't be much).the jokes and gags in the movie (if you can call them that) rely heavily upon traditional british farce, including mistaken identities, embarrassing situations, poorly-timed slapstick, characters losing control of what is happening to them and general confusion. and it all fails miserably. as another commenter has pointed out, it seems as though the writers of this movie have never seen an episode of the tv series and instead crafted out a something resembling a carry on romp. the scene where george is stripped down by sue bond's character is particularly out of context.a mystery surrounding this movie is the bbfc certification provided - 15. just why is it rated 15 when all there is to see is harmless, non-vulgar entertainment?not surprisingly the era of sitcom spin-of came to an end not long after this movie was released (shortly after the sad death of yootha joyce). and the company behind this movie, hammer, well known for producing first rate horror movies back in the 1950s to mid 1970s, soon disappeared into total obscurity.all in all, the movie is a near total washout. my advice - skip this and stick to the tv series. you won't be missing anything, i assure you.

the film was disappointing. i saw it on broadway with bernadette peters and she was outstanding. maybe as she, herself graps on to the end of her musical career, her condtion of desperatation lands her in role that she flaunts, re-invents and triumps as her own. bette's singing is always belted, always flat and lacking to show her ability as an actress. to be entertaining, this performance was dying for a stronger lead and a stronger cast, so that the others would be memorable in bette's absence. another criticism: she smiles directly into the camera every time she start singing! i know it is musical theater, but please leave some grace sociale-- middler cannot perform like liza or streisand might in a retrospective tour - out of character and out of context.

this movie was so bad it was funny! for awhile there i thought i was actually watching a parody of a bad movie (a la "for your consideration"). the "cliffhanger" scene at the end had me laughing until my insides hurt. the script was dreadful enough, but coupled with sean young's terrible acting -- especially while she explains the entire plot in great detail (complete with flashbacks) while dangling off a cliff -- makes it a truly classically bad movie worth watching! in fact the fakey shots in this scene reminded me of an ed wood movie. i still can't believe how this thing got made. first of all, how did such a bad script get the green light? how did star actors get attached? were they at low points in their careers? questions, questions.

there's simply no redeeming quality about this film. ok, some of the costumes are ok, but they're nothing you can't see in, say, the conan flicks. and what's up with ator's hair? i can't believe this is part of a series! i will say one thing about this film: it was deemed bad enough for a righteous lampooning by the early cast of mst3k and i suggest to anyone that's curious enough to see how bad this film is to watch that version of the film for moral support if nothing else.

this movie's one redeemable quality (besides ator's barely-there loincloth) is the hilarious acting on the part of the bad guy, zor. this wonderfully overplayed villain has a certain...oh, shakespearean presence that made this movie bearable (hence the 2). i just giggled every time he pirouetted, lifting an incredulous eyebrow to henchman or hero. a true example of someone not getting paid enough. (and that beard!)now really, what was with the 12-minute hang-glider scene? really, really, really bad. i can't emphasize that point enough.so, seriously, if you even deign to see this movie, watch the mystery science theater 3000 version. with those dear silhouettes has many a horrendous movie been tolerated.

i just read an extra long review on the front page of this movie on this site and he explained in full detail that this movie is only worth watching on the television show "mystery science theater 3000!!!!!" and yes, i do find that advice really helpful! i mean, a movie that tries to be this good and this exciting just really is not what that movie wants to be!!!!! so yes, do watch this movie as seen on that show and instead of giving this movie a single star out of ten stars, you can give this a ten out of ten stars! until then, my one star review is for the real, pure, untouched version of this movie only!!!!!! got that now?

did beavis and butthead make this movie? it is just that bad. truly an uneven and unfair portrayal of "bad" vs. "good" in the wine world. did you notice the filmmaker trying any of the wines from the featured protectors of individual wines and terroir. the camera work is dizzying at best while the content may put you to sleep before long. this is not insightful journalism. what i got from this movie was that the filmmaker was trying hard to make a point about the globalism of wine by showing, for example, that the mondavi family owned wineries in all parts of the world. okay, that is a good start. so, how do these wines compare? does the mondavi napa cab taste like their italian wines. we never find out because no one in the film comments on this. instead, there is a lot of innuendo about nazi's and fascism. well, those things don't grow grapes. hmmmm.

the movie 'heart of darkness', based on the 1899 book by joseph conrad is one with little to no detail and has an almost schizophrenic like plot line. if you have read the book then you know that little to none of the important "story making" scenes were put into the movie. in the book there is so much that is left up to the imagination and i feel that that is one of the part that make the book what is it. an example would be when marlow spent timeless hours and days, even months waiting for rivets and that entire scene was left out of the movie. again if you have read the book then you would know that this scene in the book is one that almost describes the main, theme of futility, best. finally i feel that the movie was too cut and dry. not enough though was put in to the original text and how that made the story what it is today.if you have not read the book, 'heart of darkness' (preferably, the norton critical edition) then don't waist your time in renting or buying the movie. however if you have read the book then i think that you will appreciate the book a lot more if you decide to watch the movie eric 2007

this film appears to be an exposé of the current trend towards globalization and homogenization in the wine industry. wineries around the world are more and more either joining large conglomerates (the american producer, mondavi, in the case of this film) or paying high-priced experts to help them make "the perfect wine"--and as a result, wines are becoming very standard and predictable. to some, this is a good thing (especially since few can afford to pay $50 or more for an everyday wine) and to others this is horrible as the uniqueness of smaller wineries is disappearing. i truly can understand the concerns of both sides and don't think there is a villain or hero in this business. sure, good and cheaper wine is a nice thing, but like what's happened with beers (with giants like unibrew and anheiser-busch), food (mcdonalds), shopping (european shopping malls are almost indistinguishable from american ones) and mega-stores (like walmart/asda) are taking away much of the uniqueness of "the little guys". so i definitely was ready and willing to listen to these film makers. however, with a product that is almost two and a half hours long and a general lack of focus, the film simply became too big a chore to watch and i lost interest. an 80-90 minute focused film would have been much more effective--especially since the average viewer is not an oenophile (that's the high-brow word for a "wine aficionado").on the very positive side, the film makers are smart not to do much talking at all--and simply let those on both sides of the issue do the talking. plus, the topic is so relevant and timely. however, despite choosing a good style of documentary making, the film simply goes on way, way, way too long and ended up making a very dull film.

heart of darkness movie review joseph conrad's heart of darkness is pretty dark, deep, and very profound. i would have to say reading the novel is way better than the movie. the character mr. kurtz, played by john malcovik was totally the wrong actor to do the part. he fit the character in "of mice and men." the movie left out man key parts that i consider important to get the true message of the story.the movie is poorly edited. it shows a lot of non-important and annoying flashes. in the novel it has a very suspenseful atmosphere, but in the movie it lacks that kind of feeling. in the book there is so much that was left to the imagination of the reader. for example when marlow spent timeless hours and days waiting for rivets and that entire scene was left out of the movie. in the novel marlow waited very long time for the rivets to come for him to fix his boat. this was a big source of futility in the novel. the movie added more parts that were useless and kind of didn't make sense. for example, when kurtz was talking to marlow at the end of the book and kurtz snapped the monkey's neck and killed him. that kind of just ruined everything, didn't make any sense to me what so ever. so my suggestion to you is don't view the movie, just read the book. you will understand more and have a better interpretation of the story.~chris c.

joseph conrad's novel, heart of darkness, had a vivid sense of description that made this book astonishing. when reading this book i had every scene totally drawn out in my head and i knew what every character looked like. this book had many pieces and when i finished reading this book it seemed as the puzzle had been completed. after i finished reading heat of darkness, i watched the movie, which was a mistake. the movie cut out so many substantial parts. for example, in the novel marlow waited a very long time for the rivets to come for him to fix his boat. this was a big source of futility. in the movie that part was just left out. the movie added more parts that were useless and made no sense. for example, when kurtz was talking to marlow at the end of the book and kurtz snapped the monkey's neck and killed him. what purpose did that scene have, other than to make the audience feel sorry for the monkey? it's as if the script writer didn't even read the whole book and just put the parts that he read in the movie. if i had not read the novel before i had watched the movie i would have been thoroughly confused. the book was amazing and it is truly a classic in american literature, but the movie could have defiantly been nominated for the worst picture in the razzie awards.

the 1994 film production of heart of darkness was in no way capable of living up to the outstanding book. the film contained unnecessary scenes that confused the viewer rather than aiding them in understanding what was going on. the director was obviously not experienced, and if he is, then he didn't show it. on top of that, scenes from the book were left out or changed, scenes that were rather important. the movie left me feeling rather bored and was a complete waste of my time. the characters acted as though they had no idea what was going on, and the actors did not portray the emotions that marlow and the rest revealed in the book. overall, the movie was terrible and completely lacked the suspense that was otherwise necessary to make it even remotely interesting.

the movie adaptation of heart of darkness is disappointing, both as a movie and as a representation of joseph conrad's classic story. there are several small differences between the book and movie, but that's expected in any book to movie transition. kurtz dies in a different location; the manager does not accompany marlow on his voyage; kurtz's mistress spends much more time with him than in the story. the real issue is the amount of footage that's put into the movie but has no basis in the actual story. for some reason, the director finds the need to "spice up" a few of the scenes, adding drama or actions that seldom make any sense and are always unimportant to the story. some examples that come to mind are kurtz's "mistress" beating marlow over the head and knocking him out. nothing happens while he's unconscious and marlow didn't even provoke the attack. a couple hours pass and he wakes up: total waste of time. kurtz has a pet monkey which, for some random reason, he kills on a whim. also, when marlow leaves kurtz's station, he makes the "noble" decision to leave behind all the priceless ivory he had obtained, for no real reason at all. one other flaw is kurtz's character. john malkovich is a terrible choice to play the man who is described as tall and inspirational: a man with a commanding presence. he practically whispers all of his lines which, in a more capable actor's hands, could have been very thought provoking. i can't remove the image of john malkovich playing a mentally disabled farmhand in of mice and men when i'm watching him botch the role of kurtz. over all, i would rate the movie at 3 out of 10 stars. it's a good movie if you've read the book and want to see it in movie form, perhaps to help you visual the scenes, but as a source of entertainment, i would never recommend it.

if you're looking for a movie that puts you to sleep, then heart of darkness is the movie for you. the book wasn't what i expected to it to be, and the movie disappointed me even further. the cast list was pitiful, and the all around plot was pathetic and was not like the book, except for a few scenes. i understand that everyone has their own point of view as they read heart of darkness, and they create their own movie in their head, but they director cuts important scenes and adds pointless ones. if there was someone in the movie who was supposed to be of a certain culture, they should've used an actor that was of that culture. there are actors from every where, and i'm sure that they could've found better ones to fit the roles. joseph conrad was a respectable man and created a book that will entertain you if that's what you're looking for, but the movie was cheap and pointless, and someone who could make the movie as respectable as the book should've done it. if you want a movie that drags you into darkness, then heart of darkness is the movie for you.

in a sense, this movie did not even compare to the novel. however, it was good to have a visual of what the congo looked like and also the natives if you are not good at visualizing as you read. i would never recommend watching the movie rather than reading the book. i hardly suggest even watching this film, let alone any other films based on this literary work. this movie; and many others, did not fulfill this book. one important part that is missing from the movie is marlow's sense of how government of lack of there in africa was forming an early genocide. also in the movie, marlow and his companions didn't stop and get the note and wood. likewise, kurtz' african mistress knocks marlow out towards the end of the story which has a major influence in the story but was not in the book. in the novel, kurtz died on the ship, however he died in his hut in the movie. the fiancé's reaction to marlow's interpretation of kurtz' last words also differed. this movie is only effective if you wish to visualize more clearly the novel.

if you've ever heard the saying, "the book is always better than the movie," heart of darkness is no exception to the rule. i believe that it was much easier for me to comprehend the details of the novel over the movie because i read the book aloud with my english class. we discussed each paragraph in great detail so i grasped the concept pretty quickly. i couldn't really understand the plot as well while watching the movie. this may be because there were no discussions held in class, but i suppose it is also because i couldn't paint my own pictures in my mind of the events of the novel. if you're the type of person who believes in that well-known saying, then leave watching the heart of darkness movie off your to-do list.

heart of darkness movie review could a book that is well known for its eloquent wording and complicated concepts ever be made into a movie good enough to portray the deep meaning in the book? so far, that goal hasn't been achieved. the heart of darkness was attempted to be made into a movie in 1993, but it was a failure in comparison to the book.it is hard enough to make any book into a movie. there always is the worry that it won't be as descriptive or have the same meaning. so why the novel, the heart of darkness, is made into a movie, i am clueless. there is so much description and hidden meaning throughout the entire book. when just reading the words plainly, i think that a person would think it is pretty boring and wouldn't get the symbolism. i think that is what happened in the movie; the movie just skimmed the story at the surface.the movie didn't even follow the full storyline of the book, major changes were made that i thought made the movie worse. for example, the manager did not go along on the boat with marlow and the rest of the crew, the spy did instead. i think that took out some major plots and took out the great deception of the manager in relation to kurtz. also, kurtz wasn't even on the steamboat when he died, which especially made the entire journey even more futile, which just got annoying after a while. and when marlow was telling kurtz's fiancée about his final moments and words, it was no where near as descriptive or important, the fiancée didn't even get that upset.as far as the acting went, none of the actors did a very good job except for the actor that played mfumu. in my opinion, kurtz was not very evil, and that was kind of an important thing in the book. also, other characters such as marlow, the manager, and the fiancé didn't do the characters justice that they deserved from the book. their acting wasn't very exciting or memorable at all. over all, i don't think that this book should have even been attempted to be made into a movie. i think it is fine to use some of the themes in a different story line like in apocalypse now. but as for following the same exact story line of the book, it just does it shame.

after reading the book, heart of darkness, the movie did not do it justice. the movie puts the book to shame and anyone who has not experienced the book would frown upon the story and plot because it was portrayed so poorly by the movie. in the film, the characters and set were just some of the let downs that occurred in the movie. the director left out so many important and interesting aspects of the book that made it one of the best literary works ever made.of course any book is better than the movie but these weren't even comparable. joseph conrad as a writer was brilliant in vocabulary and the cleverness of the written word. the movie doesn't even start to show any of this. some of the very important and influential scenes from the book were completely left out, like how kurtz was not in the boat when he died. also when marlow went to deliver the news to kurtz's intended, she reacted differently in the movie, rather than the book. another major difference was that marlow saw the picture of the lady that was blindfolded at the end of the movie, not at the beginning, like the book. this was influential on how the audience perceived marlow, and the movie totally messed that up.the book was so fine tuned on what every location looked like, but the scenery in the movie was a let down. there was a bunch of cheesy fake backgrounds and to compliment, a bunch of bad actors to go along with it. there was one exception to the awful actors and that would be isaach de bankolé, who played mfumu. his character was depicted the best. though the movie wasn't that great, i still would recommend it only if you have read and understood the book very well. that way, you can see what the differences are in the movie and book and contemplate them. if you have not read the book, i do not recommend the movie because it is a boring, lifeless mess. i loved the book, so you should definitely read it and enjoy it.

a made for television version of the heart of darkness seemed like a good way to add more insight to the book, well, that was the wrong assumption. the movie made it even worse. i was highly disappointed about almost everything in the movie. i hoped that the movie would possibly help put the pieces of the book together that i didn't comprehend, but it did no such thing. it still left me confused and hanging. it is one of those movies that makes one feel like it would be more fun to watch the grass grow instead of watching the movie. not exactly anyone's cup of tea. it was an overall dreadful, boring, and slow movie.to begin with, nicolas roeg must have been pretty desperate when he decided that he wanted to undertake the task of making the already boring book into a movie. it's a guaranteed loss. it's like going into a knife fight, but forgetting the knife on the kitchen counter. the knifeless person is going to lose; and in the case, the knifeless person was roeg. all i've heard about the movie are bad things, and the movie deserves those bad things to be said about it. from watching the movie, i got the impression that the people who made the movie, just skimmed over the book to get the key points.furthermore, although the movie did follow the main story line of the book, it left out quite a few details, and it also changed the ending. i am not a fan of that. roeg left out when marlow and his crew came across the russian sailor's camp, and at that camp they found the book. also it didn't show when at the camp they came across the sign that says, "wood for you. hurry up. approach cautiously" (conrad 110). also, at the end of the book kurtz dies on the boat, not at the inner station.on the contrary, nicolas roeg did one good thing while he was making his movie; he managed to hire some pretty decent actors to play in the movie. for instance, he acquired tim roth and john malkovich, both of whom would later go on to have successful careers. in doing so, he added a little something to the horrible movie. also, though i am ripping his book to shreds, i do have some respect for him, because it takes a lot of courage to try to take on the heart of darkness. it isn't exactly the easiest novel to portray into a film. twus a valiant effort, though! in conclusion, if for whatever reason someone actually wants to watch this movie, i suggest the reading of heart of darkness first. this way, you'll get all of the scenes that were left out of the movie and you won't be completely lost when you watch it. but i really suggest you don't read the book and that you really don't watch the movie; both will be a complete waste of your time. trust me. i was forced to do both by my english teacher, and now i wish that the book and the movie didn't exist. if either the book or the movie are pursued, good luck!

an interesting period picec showing us what was amazing in 1938. gosh, ma, a fake accident ring suing for $25,000!!! i guess projected into the 21st century it would amount to a lot of money. the acting would amount to pure 21st century ham. nice to see the president as a hard-working newcomer.

taylor deemer mrs. drake english 10 pib b4 31 march 2010 a shot in the darkit is difficult to make it through the movie heart of darkness because it is incredibly unexciting. the book that this movie is based off of has little action to begin with. so the thought of turning it into a movie seems like a totally off-handed idea anyways, basically guaranteeing a fail. most of the book is of the mental travel of a young seaman named marlow on a job through the many darknesses of the congo and people as a wholei feel like the screenwriter failed massively at capturing the essence of marlow's travels. it totally missed the biggest issue of light versus dark. that is the major point in the book and when that doesn't translate to the movie, all that's left is 100 minutes of boredom and monotony. this being the case, the question is posed, why would anyone make this into a movie? an even better question could then be asked, who would want to watch it? it is utterly a chore to watch. had it not contributed to a grade in my english class, i would have never even considered watching the movie. i would never recommend this movie to anyone. heart of darkness is stripped of all its insight and meaning when it's taken from the pages of the book. the novella is torture to read until the last twenty pages or so, but the afterthought is that it is a pretty decent book. the movie is like a shot in the dark with no chance in the world of hitting its target. how can a book that's all about the mental processes and realizations of darkness be portrayed in a physical, visual sense? i feel like it's impossible to accurately show thoughts. also, i feel like the time difference between the book and the movie creates major points that don't seem to add up at all. the novella heart of darkness was published in 1902, while the movie version of heart of darkness is from 1993. the 91 years between the two may be a reason behind the seemingly different terrains. the novella seems to have much harsher conditions, and the movie does not portray the prehistoric feel of the congo. the congo, in the movie, just seems like another place, not the dark, inhuman place that the book paints this setting of. i feel like this removes another major element that really contributes to the novella.with two of the biggest aspects of the storyline missing in the movie, the little bit of decency that is in the book heart of darkness is gone. when the controversy of light versus dark is the biggest theme, not including it in the movie makes it seem like the entire movie will be incredibly pointlessand it is. it's dull, unexciting, and a major waste of time. there's no reason to watch it. the book is stripped of any significance it has. if it's necessary, for some reason, read the book. avoid the movie at all costs. cast and credits marlow: tim roth kurtz: john malkovich the russian:morten faldaas the intended: phoebe nichollsdirected by: nicolas roeg written by benedict fitzgerald, based on the novella by joseph conrad running time: 100 minutes rated pg 13 (some sexuality and language)

to be honest, i've never been to the congo or even africa, and after watching the made for television movie heart of darkness, i do not think i'd want to. the movie completely shames the book to the highest level possible. though the book was not the best i have read, after watching the movie, i seemed to appreciate the book a hundred times more. nicolas roeg, the director of the movie, did a horrible job portraying joseph conrad's novella into a movie. i give roeg some credit for trying to attempt the impossible by making the book into a movie, but this may not have been the job for him. the movie was unsuccessful to express any part of the novella other than the basics of the plot. the set and scenery also lacked the beauty conrad portrayed of africa in the book. in the book marlow had seen so many great wonders, but in the movie you did not get that same experience. no, i'm not blaming everything on the director; the acting in the film was just terrible. all of the actors were dull and uninteresting. throughout the whole movie i felt as if the actors were not putting forth any emotions, as if they were reading from the script the entire time. tim roth, who plays marlow, did not portray marlow's sense of adventure for his journey into the congo well. marlow's journey to find kurtz was supposed to venturesome, but i didn't experience that in the movie. i would not recommend watching this movie, especially if you have read the book already. it does not come close to doing justice for joseph conrad's novella. conrad's words capture the reader and take them on the journey with marlow, on his quest to find mr. kurtz, where as the film did not. a great novella, but a very poor film. heart of darkness, the movie, is based on the book written by joseph conrad also called heart of darkness.

the movie heart of darkness is an insult to the book by joseph conrad! to be quite honest the movie made me want to fall asleep. on the other hand, the book was definitely extraordinary. i feel that the movie left out several key elements and missed some of the main points from the book. in addition, the actors were boring and lacked originality and enthusiasm.the book, while not an adventure story or easy to understand, is full of hidden meaning and interesting twists in the plot. the book, though very confusing and complex, is astonishing. when you do finally understand it, you feel as if you have actually learned something. the novella, or short story, had several key ideas like futility and craziness, which the movie left out. in addition, several key scenes were changed, which in return affected the entire plot. many of the scenes seemed to be very "choppy", in the sense that they did not fit together. in summary, the movie seemed to be a bad interpretation of the book. i would only recommend watching this movie if you cannot picture or understand the book, but otherwise i would skip this one. it was dreadful, and in complete disarray. if you have never read the book then, definitely do not watch the movie because you need the basic information from the book to understand the movie. the movie was a horrible spin-off of an outstanding and detailed book.

despite the excellent cast and the potential of the story, this movie fails on many levels. i was convinced that the director was a beginner. the movie is very poorly edited, shows a lot of non-important and annoying flashes, has very visible goofs and has no suspenseful atmosphere whatsoever. the question which repeatedly popped up in my mind while watching this was: "so what?". i couldn't care less about the protagonist and what happens to him. it's not that the story isn't compelling, it's simply the way it's told. the movie tells the story. period. it's like an actor who mumbles his lines, without knowing what he's saying. the movie simply tells the events that happen, without any soul. and the director's to blame. he doesn't know how to make something interesting or suspenseful or enjoyable. (and believe me, i'm not somebody who wants to see die hard 8 or 2 fast 2 crappy. on the contrary, i especially like slow-paced movies.) so i was convinced the director was a beginner. but to my amazement this man has years of experience and has worked as a cinematographer or camera assistant on a lot of marvelous productions. guess he had a bad year back then.

overall, the movie "heart of darkness" was pitiful compared to the book. anyone who has ever read the book and had a sufficient understanding of it would be able to see the countless obvious flaws. there is an immeasurable difference between the two. it seems to me that the director was walking into a losing battle. i couldn't imagine that someone would take on the monstrous task of recreating "heart of darkness." the immense detail and magic of the story would be impossible to justly interpret. conrad's story had so many layers and so much depth that it would seem pointless to try to make a visual interpretation.first, capturing the details of the story is unattainable. the colossal fine points created by joseph conrad cannot be rightfully recreated through film. marlow's feelings and emotions cannot be equally construed in the movie. if you have taken on the enormous task of tackling conrad's work then, you know as well as i that conrad only wrote half the story. the additional half is a series of connections made by the reader. you, as the reader are required to be capable of inferring and connecting joseph conrad's ideas. as a result, several crucial details are absent in the movie.also, although the movie was an adequate length, the film seemed short. it seemed that conrad was able to pack many more details into 75 pages than the movie could pack in an hour and a half. the speed of the movie kept the viewer from getting to know the characters. marlow was much more of a stranger. the viewpoint of the book puts you into marlow's shoes. however, in the movie, you're almost watching marlow from a distance. i began to think that the director was trying to utilize the same "read between the lines" method as conrad did. however, the connections were weak. i know that if i had not read the book then, i would, in no way, be able to begin to understand the depth of the situation and the characters.finally, kurtz also seemed to be interpreted incorrectly. his role was short and the details weren't all included. it was impossible to comprehend the true kurtz in the length of time he was shown. an important detail in the book was that kurtz had become a god to the africans. i didn't think that significant detail was defined. also, in the book, kurtz represented a soulless being. he had died inside long ago. i believe the director comprehended this detail. however, instead of recreating it, he just had kurtz mope around and mumble everything. moreover, it seemed like the director attempted to make kurtz seem mysterious, however, instead, he seemed entirely unidentified.altogether, this movie reminded me of a teenager cramming to finish a science project, due the next day. it appeared to have been crafted effortlessly and in hardly any time. the characters were alienated, crucial details were left out, and, overall, the central plot was lost in translation.

after seeing the film version of heart of darkness, i feel as if i wasted 100 minutes of my life. though the book was not my favorite, i was very disappointed to see how poorly nicolas roeg portrayed the story. despite the fact that he left out many bits of important information, the cast just did not seem to fit their roles and the whole film seemed vastly emotionless. the book depicts vivid scenery and detail that are completely disregarded in the movie. you'd think a director would be able to fit 76 pages of a book into a film of at least an hour and a half. the differences completely changed the story for me. for example, when the character of kurtz's fiancée is nonchalant to the fact that kurtz has died, it completely modifies the ending the book had given. not to mention the sets and scenery used in the film were not nearly as beautiful as they were described. it sincerely feels as if roeg was filming another story with references from heart of darkness embedded in it. if you watch the movie without knowing the title or expecting it to be anything like joseph conrad's tale, you may find it good. though i thought the camera work was poor and the cast unfitting, it is a captivating story all the same. however, if you are looking for a good movie version of the famous classic story, don't look for it in roeg's film.

this is the first and as far as i can tell, the only completed production of "heart of darkness" ever released. prior to starting on "citizen kane," orson welles shot some test footage for a version of "heart of darkness" that was to be filmed entirely in what would now be called "pov", where we would see everything from the point of view of the main character charlie marlow; he would be seen only fleetingly in mirrors, windows, water, etc. the film was never made. the "pov" technique was used, not too successfully, in 1947 in "the lady in the lake," with robert montgomery starring as philip marlowe. presumably, the coincidence of the two "marlow(e)" characters is just that. of course, francis coppola's "apocalypse now" was based on "heart of darkness."the short novel "heart of darkness" by the polish-born british writer joseph conrad, first serialized in a british literary magazine in 1899, features one of his favorite alter egos, ship captain charlie marlow, who also narrates the short story "youth" and indirectly tells the story of "lord jim." marlow, temporarily out of work, decides to take a job captaining a river boat for a belgian company involved in the brutal exploitation of the resources of king leopold ii's personal fiefdom, the cruelly misnamed congo free state. marlow travels from london to brussels, signs on with the company, and is told that his mission is to take a boat up the congo river to a far inland station headed by one of the company's most productive agents in the colony, a german named kurtz. shipments of ivory, latex (for the production of rubber) and other products from kurtz's station have ceased, and no word has come downriver from kurtz for some time. there are rumors that he has "gone native." marlow is to investigate, take any necessary action, and make a report on his return. he takes passage down the west african coast to the mouth of the congo, is delayed for weeks while he is forced to repair his boat at the company station on the coast, and finally sets out upriver to find kurtz's station. the river, the heat, the vegetation, the wildlife, the insects, the people, all take their toll on his endurance, his imagination, and his mental resources. he finds kurtz ill, half-mad, and close to death. the final encounter and the death of kurtz are almost an anticlimax, especially since conrad is so obscure about what actually happens that we are left to puzzle it out for ourselves. this is a novel where you close the book vaguely dissatisfied with the ending but nevertheless treasuring the story for its amazing atmospherics.this "heart of darkness" was filmed with guyana in central america standing in for west africa. it is best where the novel is at its greatest disadvantage: actually showing us first world urbanites what a boat trip up a tropical river would look like. but the rest of the film was forgettable. tim roth does his best as marlow, but so much about the plot, characterizations, and character relationships has been altered beyond recognition that you wonder why they bothered. if the aim was to make conrad's story for the screen, why didn't they leave it alone? it's unreasonable to expect that no compromises will be made when a book is made into a movie, but so many changes were made that to me had no cinematic justification that you wonder whether we are simply dealing with incompetent screenwriters and cinematographers. most disappointing of all was john malkovich as kurtz. he was completely miscast and simply flubs the role. everything about him is wrong: his looks, his acting style, his voice, his accent, everything. a vastly better choice would have been someone like bruno ganz (unlike malkovich, an actual german, like the character).this is a very disappointing production and i would recommend it only after you've read the book if you want to depend on more than your imagination to get a visual picture of a boat trip up the congo river circa 1900.

i felt last night's episode was slow and kinda of boring at times. i honestly don't think it has to do anything with the writing. because i know the story was well staged and tried to keep things in place. i thought it wasn't that bad but overall, i didn't enjoy it. the most blame has to do with the director of that episode- stephen williams. i always hated stephen williams's directing. if jack bender continues with this episode from the season premiere, he would have kept it in a good pace and keep things float to keep things interesting. i'm glad jack bender is directing next week's episode and it'll be much better and i'm glad he got first syaid episode to direct and i'm curious what he will pull off this time since stephen williams had directed too many syaid episodes before.i always keep thinking that stephen williams needs to be thrown off from the show. he doesn't even do anything interesting with the show.why does the opening have to be done with a target thing while being in the helicopter? it was so boring! bad perspective of camera work too!

this series continues to frustrate and annoy. how are they going to drag this out for another year? each episode offers up more and more questions, whilst providing the answers to very few. to quote another very popular website, i believe that this show has now jumped the shark!will, i keep watching it?probably,will they manage to keep the show on-air till it ends?probably not...how did two qualified doctors fail to notice that naomi was still alive? how did 30 plus people not notice a corpse wake up and walk off with a knife still in her back? how did someone have enough strength to create two trails and climb up a tree to ambush kate?we've now introduced a ghostbuster...same time next week? yep!

this film would like to be the kind of shocking, cerebral, and intense movie that many others in its genre have successfully been, but it's not. it is at best confusing and absurd. when the twists and turns finally revealed themselves, rather than saying "ahh, i get it!" i muttered something along the lines of "okay...whatever." in my opinion, when a movie reveals a major plot twist it shouldn't have to employ a flashback sequence to prove that it did give some hints that would enable the viewer to discern the truth himself. but this movie does have a flashback; and here's the kicker: it flashes back on scenes that weren't even in the movie!the characters were stereotypical, unsympathetic, and wholly ridiculous. i feel that the "steamy" love scenes between the romantic leads were the most untitillating and unsexy that i've ever scene in a movie that wasn't porn. it seems that the director was going for shocking and kinky with the love scenes, but they were really just plain silly.and don't even get me started on the crappy accents and second-rate sets. i guess the movie was set in new orleans, but aside from the afore mentioned accents and a couple bland city shots the movie could have been in anytown, usa.my recommendation: don't bother!

honest young insurance agent ronald reagan (as eric gregg) is optimistic, but poor. his wife, scheming sheila bromley (as nona gregg), longs for the finer things in life. describing herself as "not weighted down with tons of righteousness," ms. bromley begins to spend more money than mr. reagan earns. bromley obtains the finer things in life, but puts the couple in debt. bromley is a fun shrew.handsome reagan attracts other women, like perky clerk gloria blondell (as patricia carmody); but, he doesn't indulge. to pay the bills, bromley gets tangled up in the insurance fraud racket - which helps get her husband fired. an unemployed reagan seems to be tempted into a life of crime - will he remain straight up, or get crooked? clinton rosemond has an uncomfortable "broken arm" scene.*** accidents will happen (1938) william clemens ~ ronald reagan, sheila bromley, gloria blondell

it's not easy to find judas kiss on vhs (it's not available on dvd), but i wanted to add this rather obscure movie to my alan rickman movie collection.i can't understand how the talented mr. rickman gets into these mediocre films? judas kiss boasts several wonderful actors, an interesting plot and intriguing twists, but its strange visual wanderings and chopping editing ruined what might have been a great crime drama. many scenes seem to be missing vital information to explain the character's actions: why was our hero immediately suspicious of his bosses? why did he mistrust the detective he replaced? there were times when i honestly couldn't tell if the director meant judas kiss to be a legitimate crime drama or a campy spoof. why else would he toss in a topless/alien/lesbian porno scene in the first two minutes (that little surprise certainly made me scramble for the remote since my kids were playing nearby!)? did he purposely instruct his two distinguished english actors (alan rickman and emma thompson) to use such awful new orlean's accents? as an alan freak, i confess that i still thought mr. rickman was sexy: in a rumpled, weary, "take-him-home-and-tuck-him-in" sort of way.judas kiss isn't a great movie, but it does have some intriguing moments, but i don't recommend it unless you're trying to immerse yourself in alan rickman.

alan rickman & emma thompson give good performances with southern/new orleans accents in this detective flick. it's worth seeing for their scenes- and rickman's scene with hal holbrook. these three actors mannage to entertain us no matter what the movie, it seems. the plot for the movie shows potential, but one gets the impression in watching the film that it was not pulled off as well as it could have been. the fact that it is cluttered by a rather uninteresting subplot and mostly uninteresting kidnappers really muddles things. the movie is worth a view- if for nothing more than entertaining performances by rickman, thompson, and holbrook.

this brief review contains no spoilers since the movie spoils itself. it is wooden and pedantic. it has no saving grace whatsoever. if someone invites you to his house to watch "mr. imperium", don't go. even the title of the movie is dreadful and portends what garbage lies within. the whole plot is so bad that it could drive mother theresa to despair!!! it wasn't a stroke that led to the early demise of poor ezio, it was having to act in this clunker that did him in. it must have haunted him the rest of his days. perhaps he was an enemy alien and wanted revenge upon the americans for his confinement. he found a perfect vehicle for his wrath in this travesty.

simply miserable lana turner-ezio pinza vehicle. pinza had a beautiful voice but he rarely uses it in a film that reminded me of "the student prince" with adults. pinza is no leading man either. he looks like an elderly man ready to collect social security and go fishing.the plot is extremely thin and the supporting cast of barry sullivan, marjorie maine and debbie reynolds are given so little to do. sir cedric hardwicke comes in at the end to announce that our king ezio had better return to his people. as far as i'm concerned, the faster the better. is that lana turner really singing with pinza? not bad if it is her. the picture would also remind me in a way of the 1960 movie "the prince and the showgirl" with marilyn monroe and laurence olivier.

on assignment in scenic italy, beautiful lip-synching lana turner (as fredda barlo) meets older singer and prince ezio pinza (as mr. imperium). the two fall in love, while enjoying the pretty italian countryside. unhappily, mr. pinza is called away to his kingly father's death bed, leaving lana in the lurch. twelve years later, ms. turner is a los angeles actress, about to make a motion picture about falling in love with a king. turner is being romanced by co-star barry sullivan, who wants to marry her - then, king pinza re-enters her life "mr. imperium" provides a tired storyline for sex symbol turner and debuting bass vocalist pinza, who appeared for several decades with the new york metropolitan opera. pinza likely earned his mgm feature film career after appearing in the hugely successful stage production of "south pacific" (1949). the cast album, and pinza's golden "some enchanted evening" single, sold millions. supporting casters marjorie main, cedric hardwicke, and debbie reynolds give the film a even greater sense of wasted resources.*** mr. imperium (1951) don hartman ~ lana turner, ezio pinza, barry sullivan

i watched this basically for the sole reason that it was supposed to have third reich references in it. it turned out a pretty brainless and predictable slasher film that appeared to be made to appeal to feminists or something.let me tell you something, if you wait an entire movie to see the attractive female lead's breasts, the last thing you want is a "tastefully" done sex scene with annoying camera angles that don't show anything. her busty friend didn't get hers out either, but we saw plenty of men's butts and pubic hair and guys with their shirts off. and at the end you have our heroine magically dodging the scalpel thrusts and swings of the villain (who turns out to be the hunk, funnily enough) and she easily out fights him (uh huh) while her male love interest is tied down and waiting to be rescued. the funniest part was when she picks up a chair and "swings" it at the guy and it breaks over him. now it'd be about as much as she could manage to lift the chair let alone smash it against a person with enough force to break it! it looks ridiculous, she basically brushes it against him and it falls apart. if you are going to do this sort of "role reversal" rubbish (which has already been done to death) then you have to at least make it semi plausible.there was one good bit though. the bad guy did get the better of her slutty friend, teaching her a lesson for being such a tramp and sleeping around. that's not exactly something feminists would like.pretty stupid really. not that american slasher flicks are generally much better, but you have to wonder why they bothered. it brought nothing new to the genre at all.5/10

i had high expectations going into this film, but alas, i feel let down. i bought it for 5 bucks at a used vhs place, and the version i bought was the english dubbed version. the dubbing is awful, so beware. "lola" just wasn't as good in this film as in "run lola run", and the bad guy just kinda came out of nowhere. and "lola" starts to catch on to what's going on the second she gets to the university. seems unrealistic to me. i was also wondering if in the original version there were american songs in the soundtrack... they seemed extremely out of place. too bad for this film, i really thought it was going to rock.

this is a pretty lousy picture.it offers nothing unique or original or even interesting.a medical student discovers that a secret society at her university is engaged in macabre medical experiments.and of course she becomes involved in solving the weird deaths at the school.this movie started out promising with a few cool special effects in which a guy is partially dissected while alive and tries to get away after he wakes up but then even that fizzles and the rest of the special effects are pretty routine plastic models of the human body and that unreal looking blood that these second rate horror movies always seem to have.and as if the routine plot and the lousy acting wasn't enough this movie had subtitles that many times didn't even match the dubbed english that you hear being spoken and then add that to the mouth movement not matching the dubbing ..well let's just say trying to coordinate all that in your head isn't worth it for this mediocre movie.i was at least counting on some skin in this movie and except for a bit during the opening credits this movie didn't deliver on that either.this is a boring routine run of the mill horror/gore movie---short on horror and gore.skip this movie unless "ernest goes to camp" is the only rental left.

it seems ever since 1982, about every two or three years we get a movie that claims to be "the next officer and a gentleman." there has yet to be one movie that has lived up to this claim and this movie is no different.we get the usual ripped off scenes from oaag ("i want you dor," the instructor gives the richard gere character his overdose of drills in hopes he'll quit, the gere character comes back for the girl, the gere character realizes the instructor is great, etc.) and this movie is as predictable as the sun rising in the east and is horribly miscast on top. costner plays his usual "wise teacher" character, the only character he can play, and you really get a sense of his limited acting abilities here. kutcher is terrible in the richard gere character, just miscast with acting skills barely a notch above keanu reeves.the main problem with this oaag wannabe is the two main characters are so amazingly one-dimensional, you never care for either in the least and when kutcher's character finally turns around (just like gere did in oaag) you just go "so what? the movie leaves no plot point unturned and seems to never end as if to say "oh wait, we forgot to close out the girlfriend story, or the what happens after he graduates story, or the other six plot points in the movie..." what's more baffling is the great "reviews" i see here. the general public's opinions never cease to amaze me.

actually i feel like having my review be that one word. my friend, whose opinions i almost always trust about movies, especially horror movies, warned me not to rent this no matter how tempted or bored or desperate to see a new horror movie i was, because it was a complete waste of time. unfortunately i haven't talked to him in a while, and i was in a hurry to pick a movie, and thought, 'what the heck, how bad could it be?' why don't i learn? what was i thinking? did i think it would magically turn into a better movie while sitting there on the shelf for years waiting to be rented?the 'plot' concerns a guy who edits films for some company. his boss is a jerk. the guy who had the job before him went insane and blew himself up in the pre-credits sequence, so for some reason the boss picks nerdy 'ed' for the special project of editing "loose limbs" splatter movies. he never says what ed is supposed to edit, but i guess that doesn't matter. ed is upset by some of the clips, working on them up at this house all by himself that the boss has decided to relocate him to for no apparent reason. he asks his boss if he can stop or do another project, but his boss doesn't care. he starts to slowly go insane, supposedly from watching the clips, and wants to carry out the gory murders in real life. or has he been this way all along? please note that i am making this plot sound much more deep, interesting, and coherent than it actually is.we don't care about the characters at all, or have any sympathy for them, or even hate the bad guys. the plot is really, really boring and predictable. the splatter isn't even that gruesome or creative-this is not worth renting just to see the gore, because what there is isn't interesting or original.all the 'tributes' to sam raimi just come off like really bad ripoffs, and no-one in the movie is anywhere near good looking enough as bruce campbell, so you can't distract yourself with that. i think an "evil dead ii-dead by dawn" poster is only prominently displayed in one scene in the hopes that sam raimi will be flattered and not consider any sort of legal action. a trained chimp could have written a better screenplay. every time i hear lines like "are we having fun...yet?" (which even bride of re-animator couldn't pull off without making me wince) i start feeling like picking up some sort of deadly weapon myself. characters just appear out of nowhere with no explanation, wandering in only to get killed. this might be ok if the movie was even remotely amusing or entertaining, but it was all i could do to keep from fast-forwarding through most of it. fortunately i chose to pay some bills and balance my checkbook at the same time the movie was playing. trust me, it did not require my full attention-i still felt like 90+ minutes of my life were wasted just by having this on in the background.don't watch it, no matter how tempted you are-you'll hate yourself for wasting your money. horror fans will be completely disgusted by how incompetent it is. even those who haven't seen too many splatter movies should stay away, as there are so many movies out there you could rent that are much more well worth your while. if you want something brainless, low-budget and fun, rent something else. complete waste of time with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. be smarter than i was at the time and don't be fooled by the "warning-not for the faint of heart" on the box. you have been warned!

this flick is terrible! it sets out to disgust and make you laugh, but it fails horribly. the director obviously has no sense of slap stick gore comedy, and the actors are like nothing i've ever seen - lacking both acting talent and flair of comedy. even their attempt at the english languish is really sad, and actually the down right peculiar swedish accent, in which the incoherent dialog is spoken, is probably the most comical and enjoyable thing about this film. even the gore i awful and unconvincing. if you crave gore comedy, i'd suggest you turn to classic fare such as the evil dead series or even brain dead if you must. we all enjoy a bloody good laugh, but this is ridiculous!

a swedish splatter movie? has the world gone insane?probably not, but it's still not a common sight in these days with swedish gore-flicks, the b-movie business in sweden seems to have troubles these days, long gone are the golden days of "rymdinvasion i lappland". and this movie seems to have some troubles on its own: it's just too much talk in it, it still manages to be somewhat amusing mainly for the good fx, which are great for a b-movie. the script and most of the acting is still pretty bad though, but that actually don't matter that much, it's supposed to be a gore flick and nothing more, that's where it goes a bit wrong for some reason. there's is simply not enough blood to fill the void. every person who know about gert fylking will have a good laugh over his role as a sgt. though. i nearly laughed my ass off. it's really that hilariously bad. besides the good parts i've listed there's really nothing else to recommend here unless you're starved for swedish b-movies.4/10

first when does this storyline take place? it has to take place after the first movie because kuzco knows pacha and chicha has her third child but it can't take place after the second movie because doesn't kronk get a girlfriend or wife or something? you never see her in the show.also, why is kuzco going to school? the whole plot of the show is that kuzco is going to school so that he can be emperor. but wasn't he emperor before this? and who's emperor while he learning to be emperor? shouldn't that be yzma? or was yzma fired in this time line already? and if that true why is waiting for him to fail to become empresses? plus, you know in the first movie he said he was trained from birth to be an emperor by private tutors. so he should kinda know what he's doing.kronk. why is kronk a student? he's around 25 they stated that in the first movie. he's an adult going to high school. does everyone think he's a moron? i really like kronk but i think because of his age and because everyone know that he is working for yzma he should have been a teacher. being a home ec teacher would be right up his alley.malina, is very unlikable. she suppose to be kuzco's love interest/moral compass. but a lot of time, she comes off bossy and know it all. she commonly says thinks i like "i should be proud because i am pretty and smart". she has esp when it comes to kuzco and knows whenever he's in trouble, when he's cheating, or even when he sings the hot hot hottie song in his head even though she does cheer leading, school newspaper and keeps straight a+ in all of her classes. she seems more interested in using her prettiness to get kuzco to do the right thing and do well in school then dating him. in fact, she seems more motherly to kuzco then a love interest.yzma. as i bought up before yzma is trying to get kuzco to fail so she become empresses. not sure how that's suppose to work with being fired and all. yzma seems to be reliving the first movie in every episode. in almost every show that she appears in she turns kuzco into an animal in hopes of having him fail a class. (there are only 3 times that i can think of that that didn't happen.) the jokes about yzma being old aren't as clever in the show as they were the movie. and classic jokes about yzma are used to death in the show (like the "pull the level, krunk!", roller-coaster, and the lab). also, some other points that don't make sense in this series. the fact that whenever kuzco is assigned something everyone acts like this assignment will make him pass or fail the class but he seems to pass every assignment given to him. so why does one assignment matter so much?seriously, who is ruling the kingdom while this is going on? do they have a consul or a steward? you never see anyone ruling the kingdom unless kuzco has weaseled his powers back or yzma is empresses.why is kuzco going to a normal peasant school? shouldn't he learning about how to lead a country, what to do in case of war or something that will be useful to him in the future? i could see taking some normal classes on like farming (so he would know how to prepare the country for a famine or something like that) but knot tying? how is that helpful?now i know that someone is going to say "but it not suppose to make sense; it's suppose to be funny." then they should have more funny things in there. all the funny things about the show have been done already in the movie. also, if they notice some of these huge plot holes why don't they poke fun at them like in the movie? (for example, when yzma and kronk get to the secret lab before kuzco and pacha and yzma and kronk can't explain how they got their first.)there are some good points, it is nice to see some of the characters from the first movie in the series like bucky and monkey with the bug. pacha and his family are still very good characters with a good down earth feel. i feel that this series would be amusing for younger children. in conclusion, the series is not as good as the movie that it based on but it may good for younger children.

this show is not in my opinion, good,then again i have not enjoyed any cartoon from disney channel. except for "the proud family" because that so is about a normal female teen this show is very similar to the way i feel about lilo and stich the series. it was a mistake turning the movie into a cartoon because the movie was excellent, the cartoon is terrible. disney channel was doing just fine before adding all these stupid cartoons such as dave the barbarian, brandy and mr. whiskers, lilo and stich the series, american dragon jake long,and where it all started: kim possible. the shows would have been better had they come to playhouse disney! as for this particular show kuzko will never get out of school just as dave the barbarian's parents will never return home, and as brandy and mr. whiskers will never get out of the jungle.

all this show is, is the same plot. kuszko (spelling?) is in danger of failing school, he needs to pass to become emperor. he needs to learn something, which he thinks is stupid, he then uses it/ learns more about it and realizes it's not so stupid. eezma, posing as the principal, tries to transform kuszko into some animal to stop him. every episode.jokes from the movie are copied (eezma's incredibly complicated plans, kuszko breaking the 4th wall constantly, squirrels.) they should try hiring some writers.2/10

i cannot believe this show was okay-ed. first off j.p. manoux does a horrible job filling in for david spade and pacha's voice is too deep compared to john goodman's. the theme song is so annoying and the plots of the episodes are so stupid!!! the only good thing about this show is that eartha kitt and patrick warburton remain as the voices of yzma and kronk. this show is a waste of money and a waste of your time. half of the episodes are copied of the movie. in my opinion the emperor's new groove was one of the best children's movies in years, but they complety ruined by making kronk's new groove and this show. you should watch such shows as spongebob, fairly oddparents, danny phantom, or kim possible but not this show.

i think this was a horrible mistake on disney's part. first off, kuzco does not need to pass "emperor school" to become emperor! that's never happened before. secondly, the new voices don't sound like the originals at all. very poor redo. and while i adored the movie the emperor's new groove, the new school is just stupid. like all the jokes are the same, and many are from the movie. the plot gets redundant, always yzma (is that how you spell it?) trying to become empress, kuzco stopping her, etc. or kuzco learning to become a better person. i think kuzco gets annoying with his constant complaints and questions. he is a spoiled brat and it bothers me. i do not think this is worth five minutes of your time, much less a half hour.

i don't normally write reviews, in fact, i never write reviews. this film was so atrocious it actually inspired me to start. virtual sexuality attempts to be a light hearted and cheeky teenage comedy regarding the usual trappings; virginity, boys etc. except the main character apparently turns into her perfect boy that she has created using the help of a machine at a technology fair. sound interesting? well, it isn't. the acting is the most half-hearted and appalling i have ever seen. the unfortunate thing is they appear to be genuinely supportive of script and movie, which probably explains why i have never seen them in any memorable production since. i have not bothered to learn the actors names, nor their characters. the lading lady does not enrapture or charm you and, thus, you do not care for her whatsoever. the leading lady's male friend raises no sympathy even when the script is vociferously screaming for you to pity him. the only rise he will get out of you is one of extreme anger and sudden violence. the only half decent actor was the blonde leading man, who, despite his miserably weak role, really gave it all he could, which wasn't much in the light of such a horrendous piece of work. i will not even talk about the acting abomination that are the 'bad guys' of the plot. but then again, what plot?i watched this film unfold incredulously, as i had absolutely no idea how anyone would have the foolish audacity to write such a script, nevermind produce, act in, and direct it. i can only wonder. the only reason my companion and i continued to watch such a mangled example of film was the disbelieving laughter it managed to arise out of us as cohesion, logic, class and even impotent storyline were disregarded within half an hour into the film. i have completely no idea why anyone wanted to violate the movie industry by releasing this to the public. this is a joke of a film and is best left to gather dust in warehouses for the rest of eternity. 1/2 out of 10. if that.

i thought maybe a film which boasted a cast including peter o'toole, susannah york, michael craig & harry andrews might be worth watching. alas, i was wrong. utter pretentious nonsense from beginning to end with both o'toole and york overacting wildly. i watched it twice and still have no idea what is was about. i've a feeling o'toole plays the laird of a scottish castle who has a drink problem and likes reliving childhood games with his sister (york). he is also barking mad. but apart from that, your guess is as good as mine.the film has no redeeming feature whatsoever. i can only assume the cast and director were blackmailed into making this dreary, unimaginative, stagy piffle. clearly a waste of the time of a talented cast and director. risible.

very disappointing 7th chapter of this slowly dying series. very evident that the budget was extremely low. this movie was made for one reason and one reason alone. to sell puppet master toys! fans, such as myself of the series have decided, from what i have read and heard that the only one in the series worse than this is curse of the puppetmaster. in turn, turning us away from the series. opting to make this a pg-13 film, for whatever reason, did not work in the films favor. the plot seemed almost to be there, but was easily lost in the steady stream of nonsense. the only film in the series worth watching, also directed by decoteau is part 3 - toulon's revenge.granted, i do favor the scenery in the film. yuck!

retro puppet master is complete and utter crap.in particular,the puppets look stupid,and crappy.the acting was unforgivable and the story was rancid.this movie goes back into the the past,where the dolls where first created,thats not puppet master.retro puppet master is rated pg-13,the first puppet master to be rated pg-13.the movie contains no horror,or suspense.the fact that this movie was a puppet master film boggles the mind,because this installment doesnt have the buckets of blood,good acting,or any entertaiment like the previous movies did.dont see this movie,dont rent it,and dont even watch it f its on tv,because this film is stale,not violent,and completely crappy.2 out of 10.as a puppet master fan,i am disappointed...seriously.

i have never seen a movie so bad. it's not even entertaining enough to be a drinking game.it's so bad, i don't even want to talk about it... and that's the whole point of this, isn't it? please. don't bother to see this movie. 'nuf said.

in the literal sense....reminds you of those "cops-and-robber" or cowboys-indians" role-playing games you played with your 8 year old friends. tedious and un-inspired, the storyline was obviously written to make bad acting and dialogue seem as part of the plot, but all it does is showcase it. i cant believe john badham let his name be associated with this piece of crap. this could have been done better by a high school film buff who had been given the camera lighting, filmstock and editingdestined to be a time-filler on sci-fi channel, when they've overused everything else from their library, and barely better than the paid programming shill downstream.

now this is a movie i really dislike. it's one of the most boring horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere. the settings are not even attractive for the eye and do not serve for the movie's purpose. the puppets look really cheesy , not in a good way like in the puppet master 80's flicks. what did they do to our favorite toys?!the story is lame, not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets. there aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible. i felt asleep the first time i watched it, so i can recommend it for insomniacs.

retro puppet master starts in kolewige during 1944 where puppet master andre toulon (guy rolfe) & his living puppets plan to escape germany, hold up in an inn puppet master toulon reminisces about his early life & the point at which he learned the secret of giving life to dead objects way back in 1902 in paris when his younger self (greg sestero) ran the theate magique. he describes the fateful night when he met a 3000 year old egyptian sorcerer named afzel (jack donner) & the eventual love of hi life the young & beautiful ilsa (brigitta dau). he tells the story of how afzel passed the gift of life to himself & gave life to his own wooden puppets that were part of the theatre magique show. however the gift of life was also a curse as the ancient god sutek whom the secret was stolen from in the first place by afzel wants it back & everyone who has learnt it dead...as of late i have been on a bit of a puppet master bender as being a big fan of the first three i decided to watch the rest of the franchise & as such i have seen puppet master 4 (1993), puppet master 5: the final chapter (1994), curse of the puppet master (1998) & now retro puppet master in the space of a couple of weeks & boy was it tough to get through them all, especially this one as it's the worse of the series so far. retro puppet master feels like a cross between puppet master iii: toulon's revenge (1991) with it's period setting & puppet master 4 & puppet master 5: the final chapter with sutek trying to kill everyone associated with his stolen life giving secret. there's not much continuity here either, again there's none of the green serum featured in the earlier films & despite andre toulon committing suicide in 1939 at the start of the original puppetmaster (1989) he is seen alive & well during 1944 in this. the majority of the story is told as a flashback & concentrates on andre toulon himself rather than the puppets, the film focuses on his relationship with ilsa & him learning the secret of life & it's all rather dull & tedious stuff to be honest. even at only 80 odd minutes retro puppet master feels long & padded with no real pace & the no central concept as the plot never really settles down & generally hops around a lot. then of course there's the baffling decision to totally redesign the puppets which i found incredible, i mean why would the makers take the one basic thing that made the puppet master films so memorable & completely do away with it? the puppets are seen briefly at the start & the end but otherwise we get these rubbishy looking wooden caricatures that are nowhere near as cool as their modern re-workings. it's never even explained why these puppets were used rather than the ones all puppet master fans have come to love although one suspects that full moon was hoping to make yet another sequel which dealt with that very question.if a poor story & a complete lack of our favourite puppets wasn't bad enough full moon decided to go with a pg-13 rating for this making retro puppet master the only puppet master film not rated 'r' in the us (obviously other countries have their own film ratings systems) & therefore there's not a single drop of blood in the entire film, the puppets don't kill anyone, there's no swearing & no nudity either. this is tamer than tame kids stuff all the way. besides the puppets themselves being rubbish the special effect are the wost of the series too, there's no stop motion animation at all in this one, no cgi computer effects (surely in 1999 cgi was cheap enough?) & all the effects are of the stiff rod puppet type effects. i mean whenever you see a puppet 'walk' the camera is always positioned above it's wait so it's legs don't have to be shown & there's obviously some production assistant just pushing the thing along, that's as complex & state of the art as the special effects get.the one positive thing that retro puppet master does have going for it is that it looks rather nice, the period production design, costumes & props are actually quite impressive & it's a fairly handsome film to watch at times. apparently filmed in bucharest in romania which doubles up quite nicely for turn of the last century paris. the acting here is awful & maybe the worst of the series.retro puppet master is more or less the final puppet master film as the next one puppet master: the legacy (2004) basically edits together footage from the previous seven films & it's a pretty crappy way to round the series off which started so well with three excellent & distinctive little killer puppet flicks. don't bother with this, just watch one of the first three again & just remember the good times... the killer puppets would return in the terrible spin-off flick puppet master vs demonic toys (2004).

i watched the first few episodes a short while back and felt i couldn't take it anymore. the horrible looking fight scenes are the worst i've ever scene in my life. about one-third of each episode is dedicated to flash gordon and his "mighty" fight moves. i know fight choreography from that era isn't exactly up to par with today's standards, but this is ridiculous. they don't even try to make it look realistic. flash gordon, who hardly resembles a fighter, uses his drunken slow moves and bare fist to knock out four or five guys with knives, guns, and other weapons. give me a break! there's also a scene where he does some similar act while in the water. basically every episode has scenes similar to that. as for the rest of the episode, there's not much else i remember. i basically viewed it out of curiosity on what science fiction looked like 70 years ago.

thank god i was not operating any heavy machinery, it could have been an even worst disaster. shots were slow & very repetitive. different scenes, same shots, medium shot, medium shot, medium shot, snooze. story line was rather empty. william hurt was the worst. where did he get that stupid accent from? random shots of scenery just to include them really didn't add much. there were more shots of arbour traveling in her car than anything else. the direction really didn't take us into any of the scenes & it also didn't make me feel for any of the characters. i would have rated it a zero if imdb had the option. great sedative if you can't sleep. there went 2 hours of my life i will never get back.

lazy movie made by a lazy director. the characters are grotesque. despite the tragic of this war, there is no emotion at all in the movie. symbolism is artificial and inefficient (and old bosnian woman giving a photo of her son to arbour will "concretize" her willingness, will awake the super-mother sleeping inside her, a corpse eaten by worms to show the horror of genocide... too much is sometimes worst than not enough).this movie is only an advertisement, an empty elegy to a woman who is not a hero. she worked for united nations. remember un failed to protect civilians at srebrenica. who are the true heroes of this war? a canadian judge leading post-mortem trial for atrocities that happened mostly because her organization failed to prevent them? where is the criticism in this movie?

i was forced to watch 'changi' last year in year 10 australian history. looking around the class room, both classes, all 40 students were nearly asleep, all 40 heads on the table whispering to the person next to them. i refuse to believe that because i am only 16, that my opinion doesn't count, having studied world war two, i not only felt embarrassed and ashamed watching this australian piece of trash television. i was out of my mind at the appalling effort this mini series applied in the usage of film elements. the acting was poor, the screenplay was very inaccurate and the score was dreadful. please, do not watch this film, it is bias and very racists (to the japans).

"changi" is an australian comedy/drama set in the world war 2 japanese prisoner of war camp of that name. the story cuts between past events, and the present day, when the aged veterans plan a reunion. this is a much publicised and controversial miniseries, here in australia. the budget ran over ($6.5 million aust. dollars); historians and veterans criticised it's authenticity; and critics pilloried the uneasy mix of comedy and drama (shades of "pearl harbor"). series writer john doyle (half of the successful roy & h.g. comedy team), has tried to defend himself with comments about "the characters are composites of actual people"; "the troops used comedy to cope with the situation"; "it's only based on actual events"; "one of our actors was actually there" etc. i don't have a problem with any of these points. many superb fictional and factual dramas have come out of the japanese p.o.w. camp experience: "king rat", "tenko", "merry christmas mr. lawrence", "bridge on the river kwai", "paradise road", "empire of the sun", "blood oath", and "a town like alice". black comedy has often been used successfully in p.o.w dramas: "life is beautiful", "the great escape", "seven beauties", "stalag 17", "the colditz story", and even "hogan's heroes". so why is "changi" a monumental failure? - the acting in "changi" is uniformly excellent, the music and cinematography is good - it is the writing and direction that have let it down. every scene seemed to give me waves of deja vu. when anthony hayes is made to stand in the blazing sun, i thought "didn't i see alec guinness do this in "bridge on the river kwai"?". the sudden flashes into surreal song & dance brought back dennis potter's "singing detective", but without the finesse. this borrowing happened so often, it smacked of lazy writing by cut and paste, rather than homage. the constant intercutting between the past and present stories left me unable to concentrate on either. flash forward and flash back can be a useful tool - here it left me distanced from characters, where intensity was called for. the "ausiness" is overdone - every conversation seemed to include "stone the bloody crows" & such, that i was saying "i get the point, i know they're aussies". cultural stereotyping extended to the british and japanese too -sadistic young japanese officer; uptight british officer; wiser japanese commandant; fun-loving, rascally aussies etc. i thought i was watching "hogan's heroes on the river kwai". after 3 episodes i'm tuning out.

this was a very good show. i enjoyed the construction of real time and flashback, seeing the old diggers meeting again and recalling the terrors of their captivity in changi pow camp. the main problem with the way the show was written is that the scenes of life in changi are more like a holiday camp than what the place must have been like. i am old enough to remember film footage of the men being liberated from changi and other japanese pow camps. no actor could lose enough weight to have a resemblance of the state of those men. they made the jews of belsen look like sumo wrestlers. i have met several veterans from changi over the years. many would never ride in a japanese car, let alone own one. the physical and mental torture those men endured was too horrific for them to even talk about. what percentage survived? john doyle might be ok writing comedy for "roy and hg" (i hate that too) but this is a serious sugar coating of history that should never have been tolerated. i'm happy for satirists to write "the life of brian" and make fun of the crucifixion because it is obviously comedy, even if some consider it to be in bad taste. "changi" is written as a portrayal of a real event and, as such, might be regarded by younger people as a true record. great performances by a fine cast cannot redeem this lightweight screenplay.

milo is a complete rip off of the 1992 slasher flick mikey, if you actually check it up both films have the same tagline!but if you want to watch an incredibly funny film with absolutely no plot whatsoever......well then this is the film for you.the acting is terrible and the flashback scenes are overwhelmingly confusing. the story behind this atrocity is simple milo jeeder is a kid with serious family problems,his father is an abortion doctor who keeps unborn feoutus's in a jar (nice!) and was desperate for a child of his own, he figured out a way to bring one of these aborted children to life and he named him............. milo!!!!!aside from all the bad acting,terrible directing,annoying sound of milo's voice and the ear piercing sound of the bell on his bike ,if you take away all that badness its still a bad but funny attempt at a film.i'll give it a bank busting 1 out of 10

four young grade-school girls witness the murder of one of their classmates during what they thought was just an innocent game. the killer is a strange young boy named milo jeeder. sixteen years later, the four survivors of the event re-unite under happier circumstances in the same town where it happened. they believe that milo drowned in a river shortly after the murder, but soon learn that the demonic killer milo has also returned, still a young boy, unchanged even after almost two decades.the cover for this movie makes it look really cool (yet i still expected a bad movie to come out of it). when i pop in the dvd into my player, the menu comes up and makes the film still look cool. sadly, this movie isn't all that it got my excited about. the movie is your average attempt at a slasher film and when i say average, i mean just like all those other small-budget slasher movies that have never been welcomed with open arms into most members of the horror community (i'm talking about you, the horror fan). in other words, you could walk up to any horror fan and the majority of responses would be "this sucks".what mistakes did the movie make? first of all, the dvd cover art makes milo look really dark but they blow it all by showing his face in the movie in many different scenes. he had the potential of being a very freaky character. secondly, the back of the cover art tells freddy, jason, chucky etc to pack their bags and move on out because milo is so much better... why in the hell would you want to say something like that when it comes to a no-name, low-budget slasher film that has obviously failed? i mean, it just raises your expectations of the movie, making it harder to impress itself upon you. in a last ditch effort to attract attention, it says (in very big letters) "from the creator of anaconda". just shows you how low they're going to get as much attention as possible for the movie.the gore in the movie sucks, the director gives you some hideous angles when milo attacks someone. the music isn't all that bad and i never once fell asleep during the movie (congratulations). i'm still trying to figure out what milo actually is. my best bet would be that he is a zombie, if anyone else knows, tell me. rest assured, i won't be losing any sleep over thinking about it.

this is easily one of the worst films i've seen in many years. i started viewing the film not expecting much and that is exactly what it delivered....not much! in fact, it ended up delivering even less than i expected. my first reaction when i saw the opening portions of the film was that i would probably end up rating it a "4". i thought that it seemed to have reasonably good photography and a haunting atmosphere.as the film progressed however, the rating kept going down and down in my mind mainly due to pedestrian acting and a plot that went from being just plain silly and tasteless at the beginning to being both silly and repugnant near the end. by the time the movie was over, i was willing to rate it no more than a "1". don't waste your time or money on this one.

i happened to catch this supposed "horror" flick late one friday night, i wish i'd gone to bed! tell me.. is a 3 ft tall raincoat-clad twerp on a gurly bike supposed to convey some sort of fear? not here, yet mi-low is still able to beat the crap out of the janitor (antonio fargas) who is three times his size(?) uh-huh. and the ending is so pitiful... it just leaves you hanging with nothing to go on what-so-ever! i found myself asking, "is that it???"acting is about as good as it'll get in a low budget film. the aforementioned fargas delivers a decent performance; but it is my conclusion that jennifer jostyn maybe one of the worse actresses to ever strut into tinsel town! sure, cute face, but bad acting.rating: 1

this movie sucked sooo bad, i couldn't even watch the ending. milo's voice was too low and i couldn't understand what he said as well as some of kendra's lines. also, where did he get all these wedding dresses from; it was very impractical. the movie failed to elaborate on milo's drowning and how it made people ridicule dr. jeter and his practice. overall, i was disappointed that i was unable to give this movie a rating of zero because by grading this movie as a one, i felt i was giving it undeserved praise.

this movie scared the hell out of me for no good reason. the eerie music was well written but other than that, its a complete waste of time, and it really disturbed me.... i'm not really sure why either.... if you just want to see a bad 'b' horror movie, i guess you could give it a shot, but only as a last resort

this has got to be the worst horror movie i have ever seen.i hated it so much i wanted to come here and complain about how bad it was. normally bad movies are no big deal, but something about this one if you hated it.. you really hate it.if anyone liked this you probably enjoyed baby geniuses, i thought i could never find a movie that was worse then that one.. i guess not.

this movie was by far the worst movie i've ever had to endure. i couldn't believe that they tried to pass it off as a serious movie, it was so bad i couldn't even laugh at it's pathetic attempt to entertain me. if you want cheesy horror that you can laugh at, rent dr. giggles instead.

this movie was crap. the script is so full of holes; i can't see how the producers agreed to finance it.we are never given an explanation of anything. the acting is horrible. the plot sucks. this movie was obviously written for those 8 and under.i have to say this: why are the high school classes only 2 minutes long? teacher walks in, finds a frog in the desk, or drawing on the chalkboard, and 30 seconds later, the bell rings, class is over. the kids haven't even opened their books. can we have at least a little continuity?oh, the dialogue. milo jeter is the re-incarnated, aborted fetus, zombie thing. do we really need the line, "this is dr. jeter's office. dr. jeter, milo's father." thanks for the tip; i could never put that together myself. it never gets any better.why does milo talk the way he does, even in the beginning? was milo ever `real'. or was he never real, just always what he currently is? and if it was always that way, why the unexplained `accident' milo had?besides "what is milo?", what are all the unresolved items for? we see all these contraptions in his father's medical office, and are never given an explanation of what they are for, or what they have to do with the story. what are the injections for? what about the aquarium contraption? they obviously aren't needed. (see the movie, it'll make sense). and what does this medication do to anyone? apparently nothing, since it has no effect on the lead actress.this movie is a very, very bad rip off of all the other slasher movies. it's a really awful friday the 13th/halloween slopped together by a 10-year old writer. it's not cheesy enough to laugh at, it's just an incredibly frustrating bore.

stay away from this movie at all costs. i was suckered into watching this movie in a bet to see which one of us knew the t "worst movie of all time". needless to say this one won hands down. it is long and drawn out, and has no purpose or plot from what i can gather. a movie about a killer kid raised from a fetus that was grown outside the womb just has no place inside your vcr. if you are extremely bored and have no life watch this movie. but if you rather keep your sanity, stay away.

this movie was so weak that it couldn't even come up with good cliches to rip off. i love horror movies and will see practically anything, but if i had it to do over again i would have skipped this one entirely. you may think that i'm exaggerating, but i challenge anyone to find anything even remotely satisfying or interesting about this piece of garbage. not scary, not funny, not curious, not worth it.

typical story of an evil kid going after people. i suspect that antonio fargas (huggy bear on "starsky and hutch") and vincent schiavelli didn't want to stress this junk on their resumes (actually, schiavelli left this life with a mostly good resume). sometimes i wish that the killers in these movies would just go after the idiots who decide that we need a new one of these movies every other month (note: that comment is not to be taken seriously; i just think that slashers have lost their touch).anyway, this is one movie that you'll do best to avoid. it's ninety minutes to two hours that i'll never get back.

i like cky and viva la bam, so i couldn't resist this when i saw it for £1.99 in gamestation. it is bam magera's debut scripted film, penned by himself and brandon dicimaillo, and stars the entire cky crew (ryan dunn, raab himself, rake yohn, jenn rivell, don vito etc etc). brandon also is in charge of the artistic direction - which is one of the film's greatest merits - its quite ckyish in its colour style - but also shows progression.basically it follows (very loosely) ryan dunn's break up with girlfriend glauren (played by jenn). vilo (played by bam, named after vilo valo by any chance?) and falcone (bran) play his best mates who reek havoc by doing various stunts.its a bit like the cky films but with a linear storyline (which is very basic indeed) and poor acting. its strange, the usually super charsmatic gang seem to have the life sucked out of them when they know what their meant to say next.the acting and script is pretty appalling for the most part, but the second half of the film is much better than the first (90 mins is a stretch for the flick though), and there are a number of redeeming factors, such as tony hawk's cameo, dicimaillo's sub plots such as 'the futurstic invention awards' and 'the diamond bike', the soundtrack is also very strong (its not all cky and him - in fact bomfunk mc's steal the film in terms of its use of music). in the second half of the film the sense of fun is much more real - especially since don vito has a fairly prominent role in the latter part - and he seems to steal every scene he is in.the film will appeal to those who like the cky antics, but only because of the core material and not the filler or story line bullshit. oh, and will someone tell bam that skating montages, especially in films, is sooo 1998.however, the best part of the package on the dvd is not the film - but the 40 mins 'making of' doc.the last 20 minutes of the documentary deal with raab himself's alcholism and the crew's real feelings towards each other amazing candidly (as usual bam comes across as a bit of a dick, especially towards raab's drink problem and ryan dunn comes across as a really nice down to earth guy). the last ten mins of the documentary deal with a friend (who is an infrequent cky member) trying to kick heroin whilst staying at the magera household with the crew - and a caring unitary side of gang (espcially ape and ryan) really comes across - a startling gem in an otherwise dull dvd.for £1.99 i'm very satisified - although i hope bam stays to the improvised and short skits from now on.

i kind of like bam margera, so i was curious. but watching a home production with somebody elses friends and family, with a decent camera and a sound guy, just isn't good film-making. writing, direction, acting and editing is abysmal at best. but i sat through half of it. and why?this film gives perfect examples of what not to do, it is a film student's dream of what to avoid at every stage of the process. cram it into film school curiculums all over the joint!so thanx bam! now i know jackass is for real - cause you ain't looking to win an oscar, dude:)

i did not think haggard was the funniest movie of all time i like cky and viva la bam a lot more. i think a lot of it was just really stupid and had no plot for being a movie. i highly recommend not paying a lot of money for this movie but anyone who likes viva la bam, cky, or jack ass should see it. i loved many parts of the movie and then there were parts that should have been cut out. i think that jonny knoxville should have played in the movie because he is a much better actor then most of the people from haggard and probably could have made this movie allot more funnier. i think ryan dunn was probably the best actor and it should have had bam skating more.

this movie was really bad. it has that quality that a lot of indie movies have: moments of humor filled with long spaces that are completely boring. any die-hard bam magera fan will prolly like this movie, but then again thats probably the only person who would see it. someone gave me this movie to watch knowing i am a fan of jackass and was a fan of viva la bam, before the scripted nature of that show wore thin. to explain why this movie doesn't work i should just say the premise itself is played outa guy who is with a girl who is horrible to him. and pretty much the whole movie you've got this ryan dunn guy whining and bam magera skipping around like a merry mischief maker. dicamillo's performance is strange at best. it's a humorous little nonspecific canadian french accent that pretty much is the extent of his performance (basically funny for 5 minutes and then its like 'ok you're pretending to be foreign enough already")maybe it would work if they were going for parody but all they succeed in doing is making a movie with an iq of zero. i love toilet humor as much as the next guy, but this isn't even lowbrow its just stupid. its like the only humor to be gotten from this movie is completely inside and the audience, even those savvy to magera and company, are left out of the joke.next time magera is handed a sack full of money let's hope he doesn't blow it on some lousy pet project

wow...i just watched this movie...american people have this stereotypical view towards hindi films such as, all indian films have dances, songs and a love story....its pathetic how far away from the truth that is. this film simply exposes the stereotypical western view of hindi films. horrible acting, horrible direction, horrible cinematography. and all this by a hollywood director. most indian films today are much more content driven, realistic, touching and meaningful than this piece of crap. indian cinema (not just hindi) also cover a variety of different subjects. just like most other hollywood films these days, this shows a very stereotypical view of of another country, where truth is thrown out the window. this is a highly not recommended movie. instead watch good hindi films like black friday, eklavya, omkara, khakee, awarapan, gangster, don, zakhm, dor, sholay, mother india, lagaan...those films are what real indian cinema are all about.

to put in simple words or rather a word, would be best suited by pathetic !!!!!! the movie starts with attracting a little interest by the plot, but, but as few minutes by audience is getting restless for restrooms and getting snacks, or to get a breathe of fresh air outside the closed dark hall....it seems like watching a movie from 1960's where colors were dull, directed by a debutant, and acted by high school students ! movie revolves about a american high headed actress trying make a comeback into films by acting in one of the not-so-great indian movie. her acting is real sad complimented by the worse dialogue delivery.overall: i would not recommend anyone to watch this movie still want to watch: then try watching it at home, when some tv channel airs it, believe me it would be fun as this movie would not get a single advertisement and no sponsors.and better carry a aspirin, u might need it if you cant find a remote control to change channel ! p.s. i have no clue, if the other reviewers even watched the movie ? i did and wasted my $10 on the ticket !

i really like salman kahn so i was really disappointed when i seen this movie. it didn't have much of a plot and what they did have was not that appealing. salman however did look good in the movie looked young and refreshed but was worth the price of this dvd. the music was not bad it was quite nice. usually indian movies are at least two to three hours long but this was a very short movie for an indian film. the american actress that played in the movie is from the television hit series heroes, ali larter. her acting had a lot to be desired. however she did look good in the indian dresses that she wore. all the movie had not a lot to be desired and i hope salman does a lot better on his next movie. thank you.

to me bollywood movies are not generally up to much, though they are still quite desired and bollywood is a big file maker as they have their own fans.the only motive that made me watch the movie was to see to what extent an american actress could change or affect the logic that indian movie were based on. not only did not it change the movie story also this blending caused some ridiculous series of events.i mean it is quite common to see heaps of illogical things through indian movies as they have their own world in their movies. but once you see such incidents happen to an american it makes you laugh. for god's sake can you believe a famous american actress is stuck in desperate situation and feel impotent. can you imagine an american actress falls in loves with a dance instructor whose fiancée already fell in love with american's boy friend and they met each other at the same time. there were lot of similar things to mention. the less said the better.perhaps i was wrong as i expected too much from indian movies.

the basic plot of 'marigold' boasts of a romantic comedy wherein the film industry is kept as a backdrop. an american actress marigold, played by ali carter gets stuck in india. worse that, she is out of money. she then decides to play a small role in a bollywood musical, so that she can earn enough money to get back to her nation. here she gets to meet indian choreographer prem, played by salman khan. basically, the movie fails at the script level. just by calling a film a hollywood venture doesn't guarantee quality cinema. marigold stands out as the best example. the art direction is weak and outdated. musically, marigold turns out to be a dud. shankar-ehsaan-loy's is far from being acknowledged as a decent hear. actingwise, salman delivers of his most amateurish performances till date. ali larter is good and has immense screen presence. performance wise too, she is good.one can also find good reviews regarding this movie at http://www.comingsoon.net/films.php?id=36310

i read the reviews of this movie, and they were generally pretty good so i thought i should see it. i'm a big francophile and art film lover, but i believe this is yet another case in which the critics make something "arty" or "intellectual" into something it is not. i will be blunt: it contains scenes of sexual perverseness that i never, ever wanted to actually see. obviously, the piano teacher has some major psychological issues, but i really did not want to see them displayed so graphically. the film is, in essence, disgusting. i mean, when i saw requiem for a dream, i was repulsed by the last sort of scene with jennifer connelly, but that was not anywhere near the sort of disgust and repulsion i felt during this film.

i rented the video of "the piano teacher" knowing nothing about it other than what was written on the video box. i did this with some trepidation because films that win awards at cannes are usually very good or very bad. unfortunately, this one falls in the latter category. about one quarter of the way into it i found myself saying out loud, "this movie is boring." about half way through i was saying to myself, "where have i seen this before?" at the three quarters mark i had figured it out.in spite of its literary origins, this film is essentially a remake of robert altman's much earlier (1969), and better, "that cold day in the park." although the details obviously differ and altman's work was more plot-driven and less of a character study, the two films are thematically identical. there is nothing "new" to be seen in this production. every aspect of it has been done before: a character spiralling out of control with increasingly self-destructive behavior (abel ferrara's "bad lieutenant" 1992); a perverse and doomed 'love' culminating in an operatic (near) death scene (david cronenberg's "m. butterfly" 1993); uncommonly brutal sex scenes (david lynch's "blue velvet" 1986); and so on. hence, i am bemused by the fact that so many found the film to be "shocking," "shattering," etc. this highly derivative film seems to have been made for the sole purpose of making viewers feel uncomfortable, and clearly succeeded with some. however, i largely attribute such a reaction to a lack of film-viewing experience. see enough movies and you really will, eventually, have seen it all. and while it is true that i saw the expurgated 'r-rated' version, i doubt that the additional scenes would change my overall opinion of "the piano teacher."technically, the film is not without merit. there is some very good camera work and the lighting is excellent. isabelle huppert's creditable performance also helps save it from being a waste of time. this is the first of haneke's films that i've seen, and if i were to see more i expect i would have the same opinion of him that i have of ferrara: an interesting director but not nearly the genius others make him out to be. rating: 4/10.

although i can see the potentially redeeming qualities in this film by way of it's intrigue, i most certainly thought that the painfully long nature in the way the scene structure played out was too much to ask of most viewers. enormous holes in the screenplay such as the never explained "your father died today" comment by the mother made it even harder to try to make sense of these characters.this won first place at cannes in 2001 which is a shock considering. perhaps the french had been starved for film noir that year and were desperate for something as sadistic as this film. i understood the long scenes as a device to keep the viewer as uncomfortable as possible but when matched with the inability to relate to the main character it went too far for me and kept me at arms distance from the story altogether.this is a film for only the most dedicated fan of film noir and one who expects no gratification from having watched a film once it's over. i loved movies such as "trainspotting" or "requiem for a dream" - which were far more disturbing but at least gave the viewer something in the way of editing and pacing. to watch this teachers slow and painful silence scene after scene just became so redundant that i found it tedious - and i really wanted to like this film at every turn.

well, the artyfartyrati of cannes may have liked this film but not me i am afraid. if you like the type of film where shots linger for so long that you wonder whether the actor has fallen asleep or the cameraman gone for lunch then it may be for you. a large part of it is like this with short sojourns into the realm of unpleasantness. i did not find it shocking nor disturbing as some other reviewers have - simply a little distasteful and pointless. the only reason i did not give this one star is that the acting is commendable ans the film is fairly well shot. the plot, however, has little to recommend. a large part of the film just shows a grumpy woman teaching or listening to piano, which might appeal to some people. but lest you think this is harmless enough be prepared for some snatches of pornography and sexual violence just to wake you up with a bad taste in your mouth. not recommended.

i do not fail to recognize haneke's above-average film-making skills. for example, i appreciate his lingering on unremarkable-natural-day-lighted settings as a powerful way to force a strong sense of realism. however, regarding the content of this film, i am very sad to see that in the 21st century there is still an urge to pathologize domination-submission relations or feelings (and/or bdsm practices). the problem that the main character has with her mother is unbelievably topical as is the alienation and uncomprehension felt by walter (i don't mean the frustration of a lover which is not loved back in the same way, which is understandable; i mean that he looks upon her as if she were crazy, or as if he was a monk, come on!). i mean d/s is not something new in the world and i think it is rather silly to treat the subject as if it were something "freakish" or pathological; it isn't. in general, films dealing with this subject are really lagging behind the times.so, for me, i feel that this film ends up being quite a programmatical film, worried with very outdated psicoanalitical theories (isn't it nearly embarrassing?), and that does not really relate with real-life lives and experiences of those engaged in d/s relationships (personal experience, forums, irc chatrooms even recent scholar studies will show this).

isabelle huppert is a wonderful actor. the director of "la pianiste" understands this, providing the viewer with long takes of huppert's face, and these are a pleasure to see. huppert is not an animated actor--she registers emotion with the smallest lift of an eyebrow or flicker of a smile.other than the enjoyment of watching an experienced actor excel in her profession, there is nothing in this movie that makes me want to recommend it. (well, if you enjoy self-mutilation, sado-masochism, and bizarre behavior, "la pianiste" might work for you. other than these attributes, i could not find any redeeming value in it.)buried in all this strange material there is a kernel of truth. people who compete at the very highest level--musically, athletically, whatever--begin as strange people, and are shaped into stranger people by the competitive environment.not worth a trip to a movie theater to relearn this life lesson. 

this movie purports to be a character study of perversion. some reviewers have been gulled into assuming that because perversion is depicted, the film is psychologically deep; actually, considering the salacious material, it is surprisingly tedious and shallow, with no motivational substance. why is the main character the way she is? you won't find out from the script. for a better treatment of the same theme (and a more entertaining movie), try bunuel's belle de jour.

elfriede jelinek, not quite a household name yet, is a winner of the nobel prize for literature. her novel spawned a film that won second prize at cannes and top prizes for the male and female leads. am i a dinosaur in matters of aesthetic appreciation or has art become so debased that anything goes?'gobble, gobble' is the favoured orthographic representation in britain of the bubbling noise made by a turkey. in the film world a turkey is a monumental flop as measured by box office receipts or critical reception. 'gobble, gobble' and the piano teacher are perfect partners.the embarrassing awfulness of this widely praised film cannot be overstated. it begins very badly, as if made to annoy the viewer. credits interrupt inconsequential scenes for more than 11 minutes. we are introduced to professor erika kohut, apparently the alter ego of the accoladed authoress, a stony professor of piano. she lives with her husky and domineering mum. dad is an institutionalised madman who dies unseen during what passes for the action.reviewing the piano teacher is difficult, beyond registering its unpleasantness. what we see in the film (and might read in the book, for all i know) is a tawdry, exploitative, nonsensical tale of an emotional pendulum that swings hither and thither without moving on.erika, whose name is minimally used, is initially shown as a person with intense musical sensitivity but otherwise totally repressed. not quite, because there's a handbags at two paces scene with her gravelly-voiced maman early on that ends with profuse apologies. if a reviewer has to (yawn) extract a leitmotif (why not use a pretentious word when a simpler one would do), elrika's violently alternating moods would be it.a young hunk, walter, studying to become a 'low voltage' engineer, whatever that is, and playing ice hockey in his few leisure moments, is also a talented pianist. he encounters elrika at an old-fashioned recital in a luxury apartment in what may or may not be paris. in the glib fashion of so much art, he immediately falls in love and starts to 'cherchez la femme'.repressed erika has a liking for hardcore pornography, shown briefly but graphically for a few seconds while she sniffs a tissue taken from the waste basket in the private booth where she watches.walter performs a brilliant audition and is grudgingly accepted as a private student by erika, whose teaching style is characterised by remoteness, hostility, discouragement and humiliation.he soon declares his love and before long pursues erika into the ladies where they engage in mild hanky panky and incomplete oral sex. erika retains control over her lovesick swain. she promises to send him a letter of instruction for further pleasurable exchanges.in the meantime, chillingly jealous because of walter's kindness to a nervous student who is literally having the shits before a rehearsal for some future concert, erika fills the student's coat pocket with broken glass, causing severe lacerations to those delicate piano-playing hands.the next big scene (by-passing the genital self-mutilation, etc) has walter turning up at the apartment erika shares with her mother. erika want to be humiliated, bound, slapped, etc. sensible walter is, for the moment, repulsed and marches off into the night.at this point there's still nearly an hour to go. the viewer can only fear the worst. erika tracks down walter to the skating rink where he does his ice hockey practice. they retire to a back room. lusty wally is unable to resist the hands tugging at his trousers. his 'baby gravy' is soon expelled with other stomach contents. ho hum.repulsed but hooked, perhaps desirous of revenge for the insult so recently barfed on the floor, walter returns to erika's apartment. can you guess what happens now? it's not very deep or difficult. yes, he becomes a brute while erika becomes a victim. one moment he's locking maman in her room and slapping erika, the next he's kicking her in the face, having sex with her and renewing his declarations of love. am i being unfair in this summary? watch the film if you want, but i'd advise you not to.anyone can see eternity in a grain of sand if they're in the right mood. i could expatiate at the challenging depiction of human relationships conveyed by this film if i wanted. but i 'prefer not to', because this is a cheap and nasty film that appeals to base instincts and says nothing.i'm supposed to say that parentally repressed erika longs for love, ineffectively seeks it in pornography, inappropriately rejects it when it literally appears, pink and throbbing, under her nose, belatedly realises that she doesn't like being hurt, blah, blah, blah.the world has, for reasons not explained, stunted her. she apparently makes a monster out of someone who appeared superficially loving - but surely we all know that any man is potentially a violent rapist, because that's his essential nature however much he tries to tell himself and the world otherwise.at the end, if you have the patience to be there, there's a small twist. before going to the final scene, where she's due to perform as a substitute for the underwear-soiling student with the lacerated hands, erika packs a knife in her handbag. for walter?yes, you're ahead of me. she stabs herself in a none life-threatening area and leaves. roll credits.if this earned the second prize at cannes, just how bad were the rest of the entries?

a man is builing a hotel with a partner. he finds out the hotel is over-insured. things just get worse. this film has a huge mumber of scenes. they must have been put together in someones' sleep. it jumps around from place to place. it does not stay focused on anything for very long. the ending starts on christmas morning with a hotel fire. it then cuts to a night scene of that fire and then cuts back to day time. the dvd sound track is horrible. it takes a fair plot and turns into the worst film i have scene in a long time.

yet again not quite bad enough to make it enjoyable. in fact this one is just boring. it's reasonably well made, even though the script is bad, the effects are ok and the acting average. (apart from james mason who is always great, but in this one underused)i suppose it is hard to write anything about this film because it didn't evoke any reaction in me what so ever.dull, dull, dull, dull, dull.

this flick is worse than awful! it took a good story plot and turned it into schizophrenic cinema. the photography is extremely amateurish . . . looks like a 5th graders home movie project filmed with malfunctioning 8mm kiddie cameras . . . the editing appears to have been done by somebody having psychotic flashbacks (while on drugs and booze), with scenes cut short, followed by other, unrelated scenes, then chopped segments of scenes pasted in . . . totally unnecessary and gratuitous nudity . . . missing scenes . . . daytime scenes inexplicably turning into night-time scenes, then suddenly back to daytime . . . obviously no continuity. tom skerritt, wendy hughes and james mason's good acting skills are wasted, as are the talents of the "key" supporting cast - (forget the villain and the anderson women - very amateurish acting). this movie is a good candidate for a remake, even with skerritt and hughes . . . just have it professionally done this time.

***spoiler alert*** disjointed and confusing arson drama that has to do with a sinister plan to burn down a major vacation resort before new years day. being insured for ten million dollars the man behind valley view estates in the blue mountains in australia julian fane, guy doleman,is determined to bring his own project down in flames in order to collect. this has to happen by january 1, two weeks hence, before the insurance policy on the project runs out.with his mind totally on his work builder and architect howard anderson, tom skerritt, has no idea that his boss, julian fane, is planning to burn down the resort he's building and possibly set him up as the fall guy. anderson gets a bit suspicious when insurance investigator sophie mccann,wendy hughes, informs him on some very fishy goings on between fane and the insurance company proud alliance. it turns out that proud allience is actually owned, or 60% of it, by fane himself! this explains whey fane is having all these arson fires happen in order to collect the ten million dollars of insurance which is at least twice as much as the entire valley view estates is worth!we later have sophie mccann murdered, in a faked swimming accident, to keep her from finding out whats happening with the suspicious fries around and in valley view estates. it's when lloyd's of london, who's underwriting proud alliance, insurance investigator george engles, james mason, shows up that fane takes a powder leaving his ace arsonist on his own and out of control to blow fane's entire plan.meanwhile anderson has gotten wise to both fane and engles who unlike fane wants the valley view estates to go under for reasons which are never made quite clear, just watch the last few seconds of the film to realize that, by it's writer and director. the arsonist is exposed as he's about to do in his girlfriend with anderson coming to her rescue. we then have this wild chase scene with the arsonist getting lost in the valley view construction site only to have it set on fire, with the help of howard anderson, where he ends up burning to a crisps by the time the fire department came to hose him down.the sudden and unexplained ending never made clear to just what happened to the big cheese in this whole scheme of things the sinister and evil minded julian fane. it's as if fane got away scot-free and only his unstable and deranged henchman, the arsonist, who was only the instrument of fane's crimes ended up as the only person who payed from them.

i've been on a bad run of films. this is a clinker about an arson plot and a psychopath. tom skerrit, whom i really enjoy, was pretty young here. he is a builder with a passion, but he has a partner whose profit motive includes over-insuring and burning. into the mix comes an agent, who is drowned, his daughter, and her nut-case boyfriend. james mason plays the insurance investigator. any idiot, given a little warning, would know something was rotten in the nation of australia. still, they bumble their way. the most interesting thing to me was that the huge hotel that was going to be built, never got beyond being a bunch of sticks. low budget, i guess. the plot could have been interesting. maybe they should have hired a film editor (the did?). half the time you don't know where the characters are, but i guarantee a five million dollar payoff would have probably made a close watch on the structure mandatory. it doesn't work. although there is lots of neat fire.

additionally titled burning man and flash fire for its various releases, this australian made film, shot in new south wales is problematic for its producers from its outset due to several personality conflicts and extended shooting time that prematurely uses up its allocated budget, and although the storyline is at times nicely detailed, below standard post-production finishing and overmuch cutting jettisons the affair. tom skerritt plays as howard anderson, an american entrepreneur with a "passion for building" who is in process of erecting a tourist hotel in the blue mountains region, all the while unaware that his business partner, julian fane (guy doleman) has insured the incomplete structure for ten million dollars, far more than its actual worth, and plans its destruction as corollary to normal summer brush fires in order to collect a handsome sum through fraud. in line with this illicit scheme, fane arranges for an arsonist to perform the incendiary deed, a young man who also happens to be the boyfriend of anderson's daughter, and due to the future resort's being in the midst of a critical fire hazard sector (one of the many unexplained elements of the screenplay) julian has every expectation that his dastardly design will come about without serious hindrance. as the local insurance firm victimized by the crime is majority owned by fane, the policy's naturally skeptical underwriters, lloyd's of london, deploy senior investigator george engels (james mason) to probe into the nature of the felony, made more sinister because of the death, possibly a homicide, of an insurance investigator (wendy hughes) who, in following clues was apparently coming close to the cause of the arson. the setting for the film is the week before christmas, capstone of summer in the antipodes, a dramatic background, but the links within the story are not smoothly compounded, resulting in the presentation of events that are rather difficult for a viewer to follow, a problem heightened by erratic editing, the mentioned heavy cutting, and poor sound and picture quality. skerritt's semi-comatose and droning style is fatally invalidated by this dim sound processing but mason is very effective, as ever, and enjoys the best dialogue with hughes impressive as the too early written-out investigator; doleman wins acting laurels with his performance as the malevolent julian fane.

this movie is honestly one of the greatest movies of all time...if you suffer from insomnia. it is a fool-proof way to guarantee hours of sleep at a time. as the movie slowly progresses, the audience slips into a state of unconsciousness and gradually loses sight of any sort of plot that the movie might actually contain. this effect is surely created due to the lack of sweet action/sweet babes.also, mr. eisenstein was obviously unable to master the art of montage. a prime example of this is the scene on the odessa steps. for no apparent reason, an event that in real life would have taken a matter of seconds is transformed into a seven minute nightmare for any sane viewer. this editing flaw tarnishes any sort of realism in the entire film. honestly, i've seen more realistic editing watching cartoons.some individuals who have commented on this title have hailed battleship potemkin as: "one of the greatest movies of all time" and, "truly a masterpiece". well i'm writing this comment to persuade readers to avoid watching this film at all costs. my best guess is that my fellow potemkin critics simply wrote the wrong words in their summaries. surely what they meant to say was: "one of the greatest snooze-fests of all time" and, "truly an epic fail".in conclusion, don't waste your time. if you are interested in watching a movie of far superior quality, go to www.youtube.com and watch a halo 3 montage. if i played the movie "battleship potemkin" in a game of slayer on guardian, i would shoot it in the face with my sniper rifle and then teabag its dead body. peace!

this is a really really bad movie. however it's good to laugh at the horrible ideas and "special" effects. the plot centers around an eu space agency that discovers a 10th planet that orbits directly opposite the earth. they send a maned mission (they have been to mars and have yet to discover this planet? is anybody stupid enough to fall for this?) to the planet and can you believe it, it's the mirror image of the planet they came from. most everything is predictable from that point. honestly from the title of the movie you can guess just about everything. the only surprising thing here is a maned space program run by eurpoeans :) there really can be no excuse for the plot concept or execution. so it's good for a laugh or maybe if you are in an altered state of consciousness.

this is a very dull film with poorly developed characters, subplots that go nowhere, and barely tolerable acting. it comes across as a poorly conceived rip-off of "2001."the only thing making it worthwhile are the sets and costumes and visual effects. but even that wasn't enough to keep me from nodding off. i would like to get the soundtrack, especially the music during the space flight sequence, for nights when i have trouble falling asleep.

being the sci-fi fan that i am, i was always curious about this film. so i was excited to see journey to the far side of the sun finally get released on an affordable dvd (the previous print had been fetching $100 on ebay - i'm sure those people wish they had their money back - but more about that in a second).anyway, the premise of this film (just like twilight zone's "the parallel") is that there is an undiscovered planet resembling earth on the "other side of the sun". this planet is of course exactly like ours except that it's inverted. this basically means their letters are reversed and people drive on the wrong side of the road.sound intriguing? well that's basically all there is to this film. the first hour or so is dedicated to the preparations for the journey to this other planet. it's just tedious scenes of switches being pressed, banal dialog, etc. there's no point to it whatsoever. gerry anderson managed to find the most boring british actors in the history of cinema to play most of the roles. i mean they are so dull i'm surprised the crew was able to stay awake to finish the film.anyway, once the crew finally lands on the planet (after an interminable sequence of the astronauts sitting and literally sleeping in the cockpit), roy thinnes notices the copy is all backwards on a bottle of cologne and hops back on another ship to tell people about what he has discovered. oops he never gets to do it as he crash lands and dies. the end! oh wait, there's a bonus scene of one of the space executives hurling himself into a mirror in his wheelchair at the end. i guess he wanted out of this film too.i'm really surprised a film like this could get made even back in the 60s. rent if you must. do not buy.

i'm also a sf buff, among other genres, and i especially like those films from 60's and 70's with their "ideas over effects" premise that produced so many intelligent and likable stories put on screen. in a nutshell i completely agree with scott-886's review of this movie. i heard of this film, and being what i previously mentioned, a 60's and 70's sf buff, with a penchant for sf stories with touch of the "twilight zone", i expected a lot, and my expectations were heightened with reviews ranking the effects of this movie "second best" to kubrick's "2001 space odyssey". what a fraud. "journey to the far side of the sun", was ordinary, convoluted, half baked, silly looking film, with laughable amateur special effects (and remember i love films from that era and despise cgi), and it can be fully compared more to 60's sf disasters such as "marooned", which "journey" very much reminded me of. the idea behind it all is not that bad, but building the plot on a story of a twin planet to earth, on which the same world is inverted, asked for a master like kubrick to direct. needles to say robert parish is nothing like that, so he delivered boring and silly movie, that looked and felt like a matinée tv series of those days. not worth wasting your time on, even if you are an absolute fan of the genre.

i never saw the other two "ninja" movies and for all i know there are known, but for some reason i watched this one. this one starts out rather fast as this one ninja goes on a super killing spree. he is almost unstoppable as it takes quite a number of bullets to take him down. he is not out for the count though as he ends up possessing a woman and he then continues his killing ways by using her as his tool. another ninja enters the fray and apparently the only way you kill a ninja is with another ninja so he volunteers. this leads up to a big battle at the end as the dead ninja goes back into his body and they have it out in an all out war. sounds better than it actually turned out being, but at least it was not boring.

if you like bad movies (and you must to watch this one) here's a good one. not quite as funny as the first, but much lower quality. a must-see for fans of jack frost as well as anyone up for a good laugh at the writing.

in all, it took me three attempts to get through this movie. although not total trash, i've found a number of things to be more useful to dedicate my time to, such as taking off my fingernails with sandpaper.the actors involved have to feel about the same as people who star in herpes medication commercials do; people won't really pay to see either, the notoriety you earn won't be the best for you personally, but at least the commercials get air time.the first one was bad, but this gave the word bad a whole new definition, but it does have one good feature: if your kids bug you about letting them watch r-rated movies before you want them to, tie them down and pop this little gem in. watch the whining stop and the tears begin. ;)

alright, we start in the office of a shrink, and apparently not a very good one. the main hero from the first jack frost is in the shrinks office blurting out random rhymes about jack frost. gee, alright my brother is yelling ''turn it off!''. anyway, back to the crappy movie.the shrink has his speaker phone on and is letting his secretary and her friends listen in on this heroic insane sheriff. i suppose he is supposed to be the hero from the first movie, but he looks nothing like him!. yadda yadda yadda, they laugh at the poor sheriff, yadda yadda. now some people are digging up the anti-frozed snowman, yadda yadda, now we're in a lab with some type of doctor people.. i don't quite see how this has to do anything, but their poking the anti-freeze/evil killer mutant snowman with needles, heating it, shocking it, adding strange and bizarre chemicals to it, the whole nine yards. nothing. alright, they give up and leave it in a fish tank. one of the doctors leaves his coffee on the top of the tank. the janitor walks in, cleans stuff, bumps the fishtank and the coffee spills the tank which makes jack alive.behold the power of mocha! now somehow he is in..uh.. i believe the bahamas... but it looked more like hawaii.. but it couldn't be hawaii! unless they spent all of their budget on the dang air plane tickets. bah.. i wont spoil the rest of this rotten movie, so you'll have to rent it and watch it your self... er... i wouldn't suggest doing so though.... sheesh..

coen brothers-wannabe from writer-director paul chart relies far too much on ideas lifted from other (better) movies, yet does manage to create a creepy atmosphere that keeps one watching. robert forster cuts loose as never before playing a psychopathic psychiatrist (ha ha) who goes on a killing spree in the desert. the film is unusual, but in its attempt to keep one step ahead of the audience, it becomes alienating and off-putting (with a role for amanda plummer that is downright humiliating). an admittedly bravura finale, many quirky bits of business--and forster looking great in the nude--make this a curiosity item, nothing more. veteran movie-director irvin kershner produced, and maybe should directed as well (could paul chart be a pseudonym?). *1/2 from ****

two stars amanda plummer looking like a young version of her father, christopher plummer in drag, stars in this film along with robert forster--who really should have put a little shoe black on top of that bald spot.i've never seen amanda plummer in a good film. she always plays these slightly wacky characters in films that don't quite add up, and she does so yet again in this one.firstly, we have two young women, sisters, who don't resemble in the slightest, who allow themselves to be picked up, separately, by questionable men along the roadways.amanda's character, sandra, does at least have a good reason for allowing dr. jake (robert forster)to pick her up in the first place. she has been run off the road, seemingly by a maniac, and her car is pretty much destroyed.warning - spoilers ahead! however, as we go along, we realize dr. jake is not playing with a full deck any more than amanda is. he makes every decision based on the flip of a coin.when dr. jake and amanda arrive at a motel, who do we see but the maniac's car, and what does amanda do but get inside his station wagon and start snooping around. what her motive was for doing this is never clear considering the man is apparently dangerous and might try to kill her. one would think the last thing she would do is place herself in such a precarious situation.not only does she snoop around, but she finds some money and takes it.shortly after this we have several other things that don't add up.dr. jake, with amanda as his passenger, runs out of gas, and the two of them abandon his car and begin walking. one would think crossing a desert, he would have checked his gas gauge--this seems a very unlikely thing for him to allow to happen. then later, he is seen driving the same car. when or how did he get the car back? dr. jake tells amanda he knows she has taken the money. now how would he know that? he didn't see her do it as far as i know, and she didn't tell him she did it.then later we have a character named santini (david thewlis), the man who was driving the station wagon, give the two of them a lift and i'll be darned if he doesn't know amanda took the money as well. how would he know that? it loses credibility at an alarming rate the further we go.when alice, amanda's sister (fairuza balk)gets in the clutches of the killer and decides her fate on the toss of a coin - one would think she would be very, very careful that the coin she swaps for a trick coin would definitely be the trick coin - but apparently it isn't.it's jarring things like this, that destroy any credibility this movie may have had.

i'm glad i never watched this show when it came out.i just wondered why it lasted 4 years. it reminds me of the terrible 80's with fake people, fake clothes, and fake music. how did i ever survive growing up in this era? the acting in the majority of episodes i have watched are forced. this makes for very boring shows. the plot lines are not very interesting as the old twilight zone shows. the old show inspired the imagination and made one look forward to the next show. stick with the old twilight zone shows and spare yourself the pain of watching garbage.

this documentary attempts comedy, but never quite gets there for me. camp? ehn, maybe. the more apt word that everyone will agree on -- and have a hard time avoiding in any review -- is kitsch. it dripped kitsch. it was as if the film makers had worried their viewers would take the movie too seriously, and so they bent over backwards to insert kitsch and proclaim, "we're joking around here! see???"in short, i felt it was trying too hard. for example, the sock puppets that introduced each scene were (to me) annoying when i'm sure they were meant to be amusing -- or at least (ahem) kitsch-ey.do not, however, avoid this movie based on my complaints. just be ready to revel in kitsch rather than having it thrust at you unprepared. if you're interested in lighthearted fare, you could do far, far worse. at the very least, the facts surrounding the rise and fall of the bakers make this interesting and worth a view. at best, gaggles of like minded kitsch lovers will hoot and holler over choice bits throughout the film.

plankton, or creatures from the abyss as i'm positive it's more commonly known as & filmed under as the title creatures from the abyss appears over a moving image & in the same font type as the rest of the credits, starts with five 20 something kids, mike (clay rogers) his girlfriend margaret (sharon twomey), sisters julie (ann wolf) & dorothy (loren depalm) & an annoying idiot named bobby (michael bon) whom decide to all fit into a small rubber boat & head out to sea, don't ask why as i don't know. oh & the complete idiot bobby left the petrol behind & never thought to tell anyone so it comes as no great surprise that they end up stranded out at sea without any petrol for the motor & to make matters worse they become trapped in a thunder storm & discover a dead body floating in the water. shortly after their luck seems to change when they come across a yacht & potential safety, in a flash everyone boards the yacht & begin to explore. first of all they find a scientific lab with various fish specimens & computer equipment, then down below they find fully furnished & luxurious cabins. they find a chemist (deran sarafian) who appears mad & can't talk. they eat fish from the fridge which makes dorothy puke up green vomit, beetles & slugs. they learn that these fish are living fossil's 1000's of years old & have been contaminated by toxic waste dumped in the sea & that they fly, mutate, bite & are generally unpleasant to be around. i really can't be bothered to go on with this plot outline so i won't, here's what i think...this italian production was produced & directed by massimiliano cerchi under the pseudonym al passeri (i'd hide under a different name if i made a film this bad too) & i think plankton is quite simply one of the worst films ever, there are so many things wrong with this film it's difficult to know where to start. first the script by richard baumann is total crap, it makes no sense whatsoever & is so slow & dull it was torture for me to sit through. why would five people just simply set sail for the middle of the ocean on a rubber dinghy barely big enough to fit them all in? what were they planning on doing exactly? why do we often get point-of-view shots from these fish creatures but they seem to be totally invisible to the characters as they are never shown on screen even though they are right next to a character, & how do these fish get around the boat as there is no water for them to swim in? people's actions & reactions to things are all wrong, they constantly split up, they make bizarre decisions that simply don't make any sense in the situation they find themselves in & some of the dialogue is as awful as anything i've heard. i could go on all day about all the plot holes & ridiculous goings on but i'll run out of space if i do. the fish creatures themselves look awful, a mixture of rubbish rubber puppets & some really bad stop motion animation at the end, the scenes where they interact with the human cast also look terrible with some bad super imposition. i have heard a lot of comments saying that plankton is gory, don't make me laugh! forget it there is virtually no blood or gore in plankton whatsoever, there are a couple of slimy scenes when bobby transforms into a fish monster while having sex with julie but it's pretty brief & he doesn't kill her, he just sort of drips slime on her, grows a couple of tentacles & a fish head comes out of his mouth. later on julie's vagina starts to drip some dark slime but that's it, we never get to actually see what happens to her or what the slime is. dorothy has a fish creature come out of her back, off screen, & control her but again we never get to see what happens to her while margaret commits suicide, a very brief shot of a plastic harpoon stuck to her forehead. easily the grossest scene is when dorothy pukes up that green stuff with what looks like beetles & slugs in it. that's it, only one person actually dies on screen & for the most part plankton is quite tame & as exciting as watching paint dry & i nearly fell asleep it's so boring. i can't see how anybody can like this total crap, i just can't. the acting is awful, the dubbing is awful, the characters are awful & i hated all of them. tecnically plankton is predictably crap as well, with an estimated budget of only $250,000 all i can say is where did the money go? the sets are monotonous & dull with one lab & a few cabins, the special effect's are bottom of the barrel stuff including the most fake looking exploding boat ever, the cinematography is bland, the music sucks there is zero atmosphere or tension & as a whole plankton, like it's name sake, is as low in the food chain as it could possibly be. i hate plankton, it's awful in every single aspect of it's overlong 86 minute duration. do yourself a favour & avoid this one at all costs unless your either a masochist or insomniac.

boasting some pretty good rick baker-esque special effects and deran serafian in a small role, this pretty lame italian movie deserves some recognition. cerchi gets some credit for still making gore flicks while most of the other italian directors (ruggero deodato, sergio martino, lamberto bava, and enzo g. castellari) have moved on to lower-key tv movies. as for plankton, it's half piranha - half the thing, with people turninging into monsters, raping women, and causing general mayhem. the ultra-grimy, sleazy, and over-sexed feel of the film makes it hard to enjoy. only available in italian language work-prints floating around.

i walked out of the cinema having suffered this film after 30 mins. i left two friends pinned in by a great fat bloke to endure the remainder.as soon as the opening sequence of the film unrolled, i sensed something was wrong and it wasn't long before i to stop myself from hiding under my seat cringing in embarrassment. i'm not one for walking out of films however bad as they usually have some redeeming feature, but this one suffered from a catalogue of bad directing, bad acting (bar 'bruno' character & the impeccable jean rochefort -according to my friends),awful editing (in terms of theme and meaning), terrible soundtrack and image correlation that seemed to make an art out placing the wrong peace of music over the image and scene at the wrong time . the worst crime was its overall insipidness and unbelievability (a result of the aforementioned atrocities). why was it so awful? i do not want to waste more of my time explaining. i'd say go and see it for yourself but i don't want to fill the coffers of this project any more than necessary. oh, the screening did possess one redeeming feature: my friend cambering over the rows of seats in silhouette with his umbrella hooked over his arm as he tried to steady himself -more pathos, tension & entertainment in those few moments than in the 125 mins of this sadly dire effort.

sorry, but i usually love french thrillers - e.g. chabrol - but this was a glossy shambolic mess. the fact that it was based on a harlan cohen book is telling, because rather than being a french film (strong on psychology and character), it's more like a john grisham-esquire roller-coaster ride by numbers with ludicrous plot twists, flashbacks that update previous flashbacks, a predictable villain (as soon as his name is mentioned you think 'hmm, he'll be the bad guy!') and sets of mysterious stereotyped characters who seem to inhabit different movies. by the end i was laughing hysterically at the unevenness of the film's tone (the scenes where the lead character is being helped by two streetwise shady characters are unintentionally hilarious), the utterly baffling plot, the absurd coincidences and strokes of good fortune (e.g. guessing the password for an email account) and yawning uncontrollably (thought i must have misread the 1hr 50min running time as it seemed to drag on for 3 hours 50 minutes).

first off, if you want to make a good film, don't cram all your exposition into the last 10 minutes. the viewer is expected to be bewildered for nearly two hours, only to have margo's father explain everything to alex very late in the film. to make matters worse, the scriptwriter decided it wasn't enough to have the basic mystery solved, but adds in a completely unnecessary murder that we knew nothing about (involving alex's father!).there's some serious motivation issues with characters also. margo's father's choices don't seem to make sense once the film is over. why didn't he just kill philippe's father and be done with it? instead, a complicated plot to obscure the truth is concocted, but one which ensures that everyone will be in physical jeopardy for years (including the completely innocent photographer, who gets murdered by philippe's father's thugs). although alex is a doctor (whom one would think is relatively bright), he chooses to flee the police, during which he not only endangers his own life, but those whom he involves in a nasty pile-up on the freeway. why was margo's friend so keen on keeping her promise to margo, once all the crap hits the fan for alex? and are we to think that margo's father would rather kill himself rather than go to prison? what about his wife? did he consider her wishes? those are some of the main problems.then there are some nasty details, like: why was her father there the night of her faked death? how did he get a hold of the junkie's body on such short notice and get it back quickly in order to bury it with the other two? alex's friend bruno seems over-eager to be part of the mayhem, in which he and his friends have to kill for alex, notwithstanding the perceived debt he owes alex for saving his son's life. what good would the photos of margo do? they don't implicate philippe at all. and why would margo have the safety deposit box key handy that night for her would-be abductors to take? did i miss some other things? probably. minor irritations of mine include the fact that although alex is a doctor, he smokes like a fiend. which makes his marathon run away from the police even that more impressive. also, when he is riding in the convertible with his lawyer, neither of them is wearing a seat belt. how bright could they be?

according to most people i know that saw this film and to the reviews i've read this was supposed to be a hugely entertaining thriller that oh so needs to be seen by more people. i didn't expect this film to blow me away but i certainly didn't expect to find this movie mediocre at best, which is what it is.i'm no stranger to french films being both french and having studied them as a student so i'm aware of the clichés and corny plot twists that can go unnoticed by english/american audiences. there are some great french films that should have been given widespread international release but this isn't one of them.to begin with the plot is both far fetched, over complicated and too smart assed to be entertaining so you really feel every minute of its 2hr and 5min run time and by the time everything is finally revealed you are beyond caring. the main character himself is lacking any real charisma or even acting talent to keep your attention fixed mainly on him and his journey anytime close to the crap ending so by the time you've even considered swallowing the main plot twists it's begun to dawn on you that you've wasted your time! i actually remember switching off before the credits actually began to roll after the film's climactic reunion - that was the point in which i was sure i had almost completely wasted my time by the way.the film is not at all the worst thing i've seen but it seems completely overrated. for instance i read somewhere that it beats all the bourne identity films in terms of suspense or even that it has 'wall-to-wall tension'. i can safely say some people are hyping up this frankly dull movie.4/10 is a generously considerate rating for this film i feel, and since i have seen some complete and utter stinkers, i'll therefore save the 1s, 2s and 3s for them.

martha plimpton has done some prestigious movies, working with river phoenix and harrison ford, but she was never able to expand her limited, tomboyish appeal into the same class as, say, molly ringwald. this film, which was barely released, is just an extension of her late '80s/early '90s attempts to find a screen-persona which was identifiable to moviegoers, and it represents another failure. plimpton plays a troubled young woman who finds out on her 21st birthday that she was adopted and--worse than that--was actually abandoned as an infant on her parents' doorstep! she sets out to find her biological mother and father, but the viewer has no clue why she'd even want to (would simple curiosity give her this much determination?). unattractive material given sitcom handling; it starts off on the wrong foot and never recovers. plimpton gives a sour, surly performance, but hector elizondo and mary kay place are fine as her adoptive parents. *1/2 from ****

let's not kid ourselves, this atrocity is not plan nine or cat women. it is bad, period! the performances vary from drama school theatrics (marla english) to a 'couldn't care less' walk through (tom conway). the photography (even in a good print) is so murky it is occasionally hard to see what is happening. the real problem, however, is the aimless, pointless, nearly plot less story and the leaden, paceless direction. at a brisk 77 minutes it still feels endless.the screenplay is especially inept. there are two story lines that only intersect at the very end of the picture. tom conway is trying to create a super race, using voodoo and modern science (although there is little science in evidence) which he can control telepathically. he is keeping his wife prisoner (for no discernible reason). meanwhile a couple of petty crooks and a white hunter type guide are trying to find the village in which he is working, in the expectation of gold and jewels. when they finally arrive, tom conway decides that one of them, the woman, is the perfect subject for his experiments. she is turned into a monster, kills conway (natch!) and then reverts to normal. she sees a gold statue half drowned in a boiling pool, tries to retrieve it and falls in the water and apparently drowns. the white hunter rescues the wife. in the final shot we see the supposedly drowned woman emerge as the monster again; threatening a sequel (now that really is a scary thought!).the aip producer, samuel z arkoff, in a lecture included on the dvd, prides himself on spotting the teenage niche market and satisfying it with ingenious low budget movies. however, it is difficult to see how anyone could think this rancid concoction would satisfy any sort of audience. what appeal do they think it could possibly have? the monster appears so rarely that it could hardly be called a horror film. the jungle action is tepid and tedious. there are no teenagers in it and no characters that teenagers could be expected to identify with.the producers exposed 77 minutes of film, but they didn't make a movie. this is a con trick and arkoff should be ashamed of his association with it.

this 1950's howler is so bad it's unintentionally funny. tom conway portrays dr. gerard, a scientist who is turning natives into a monster using voodoo. his poor wife, played by mary ellen kay, is being held captive by her wacko hubby who has no time for her but threatens to kill her if she leaves him. along comes marla english as a greedy murderess who has already killed a man to find treasure in the jungle. her idiot boyfriend, portrayed by lance fuller, is along on the safari. they hire "touch" connors, (later renamed mike connors, of mannix fame) as a guide. english is a terrible actress, but hey, no one else in the cast were turning in academy award winning performances either. "touch" (i'm sorry, i can't even type the name without cracking up, i mean, what the...) gave the only half way decent performance of the bunch and that's saying a lot. the monster is only seen briefly, and the ending is predictable to say the least. i would say this movie falls into the "it's so bad, it's almost good" category of movies. it's good on a rainy night when nothing else is on the tube.

let's face it, this is a pretty bad film.however if you go in ready to make fun of it you can survive the experience.okay, you'll scream in agony a lot.african jungle fun in a dopey kind of way.tom conway (who spends most of the film wearing a funky chapeau) is using the local witch doctor and mad science to create a "perfect" being.it looks like a varmint that has been on a six week drunk and is in a sack dress.ugly is being kind.but it won't kill for him because he's using a good girl as his subject.he needs a bad bad girl.marla english and lance fuller are two petty crooks in search of african gold.acting lessons for ms english should have been at the top of the search list.she's a bad girl and lets everybody know it in a performance worthy of a junior high school play.mike "touch" connors is the white guide english & fuller con into leading the expedition.english & conway finally meet and it is a match made in hell.she is the perfect subject to become his voodoo creature because she'll do anything (stress anything) to get what she wants.you will do anything to stop the agony of this movie at this point.what made this movie interesting for me was conway wearing that funky tribal hat/headdress/floral piece!still trying to figure out what kind of dead animal it was.guess he thought if he pulled it down low enough over his eyes nobody would recognize him.truly bad cinema.

awkward disaster mishmash has a team of scavengers coming across the overturned s.s. poseidon, hoping to loot it before it goes under for good. irwin allen's sequel to his 1972 blockbuster "the poseidon adventure" arrived in theaters seven years later! never mind that nobody cared anymore, why give us such a shoddy production, filled with dim characters and miscast actors, only to trash the memory of your biggest hit? one might end up feeling really sorry for michael caine, sally field, peter boyle, jack warden, karl malden and shirley jones were it not for their lost-at-sea expressions (good for a few stray laughs). there's a moment when saintly jones is tempted into taking some treasures just for herself and she timidly starts stuffing her pockets that is an unintended hoot. the film was a career bungler for all concerned, most especially allen, who never quite recovered from this. * from ****

wretched. talk about botched. beyond the poseidon adventure is bad in every respect. salvagers michael caine and karl malden decide to tow the wreck of the eponymous ocean liner with a really creaky tug boat. they're challenged by ruthless telly savalas and his gang of machine-gun toting goons. this part sequel, part remake has caine, malden and another group of poseidon survivors making a similarly dangerous trek out of the sinking ship. among this group are shirley jones, slim pickens, peter boyle, shirley knight and slim pickens. jack warden plays a blind man. surely, you'll wish you were blind after seeing this mess. sally field is particularly annoying as a stowaway on board caine's tug.disaster master irwin allen not only produced this one, he decided to direct it as well.

sequels, well there are many reasons to make 'em but what went through irwin allen's mind to come up with such a boring idea is beyond all logical matters. there are so many open answers to this movie that it is ridiculous...like the poseidon which is a monstruous ship with passengers on is drifting on the sea and just michael caine with his miniboat and an evil telly savalas discover the boat...well, at the beginning the french marine are circling above the wreck with their helicopter but as a sinking cruiseship is a daily thing, they just fly away... what am i trying to say??? hmmm, michael caine goes on board with sally field and he might pick up everything he sees (diamonds)if there wasn't a telly savalas who is looking for weapons on the ship...my god, why in fact am i wasting my words on here? it's ridiculous and knowing that both field and caine were involved makes you think what went through their minds when reading scripts....certainly not diamonds....

maybe here in sydney we are all poop side down and as a result we get to lap up floaters like this s-eek!-uel in classy theaters. released here in 1980 this hilarious all-tar drama was greeted with howls of delight at the session i attended. in fact the audience were so into the ludicrous antics on screen it played like a rocky horror session. within 5 minutes we all knew it was a real disaster: the tug boat scene where you can see the buckets of water tossed in from off-set. after that it was every patron for himself and the cinema rang with advice, cheering for bad acting and oo-waah reactions. the gunfight in the hold among the crates is especially idiotic and allows drunken viewers with friends in altered states also watching to contribute appropriately. i call these films with michael caine his holiday house films as i always reckon he agrees to do them because he has seen a house he likes and doesn't want to spend his savings. like jaws 3 or 4 or whatever it was called.

i accidentally caught this in the middle flipping channels. i immediately recognized almost everyone in the cast, "groovy" haircuts aside, and wondered what kind of film could attract such a cast of both past and future stars? having not seen the original, i guessed it might be the poseidon adventure, since it was obviously on a ship in distress. was i wrong! i cannot for the life of me imagine why any of these great (or promising) actors and actresses would allow their name to be associated with such trash. there is no story, the performances all looked forced, the characters a parody of the usual disaster movie roles that are suddenly brought together by an event, and start pontificating about the real meaning of life at the level of bumper sticker philosophy.it is only worthwhile to see the unusually awful performances by such greats as sally field, michael caine, et al. they must have needed the money badly. can we blame the director?

...but other than that, there's almost no redeeming social value to this sequel to the original poseidon adventure. where the heck are all the people from the original, including the rescue crew? michael caine undergoes his most humiliating performance to date (although he later trumps himself with jaws 4 down the road). slim pickens is just embarrassing as a stereotyped texas, and generally you just have to wonder, "why did they bother?" irwin allen's last stab at cashing in on the disaster craze, i guess.

being stuck in bed with the flu and feeling too rough to get up to find the remote, i actually watched this abomination from start to finish (how many people can say that? and for any who can - what's your excuse?). my god, has there ever, ever been such a total mess released by a major studio? there is not one second of genuine tension in a supposed "thriller"; the script is inept and ludicrous; the sets look like they were leftovers from a low-budget tv movie; and the cast ... what were they thinking?!!! sally field gives what is without doubt the worst and most embarrassing performance of any academy award winner in history. her irritating nasal whine and stupidly perky behaviour in what is meant to be a life-threatening situation are truly asinine. it's a wonder she didn't use all her future earnings to buy up and destroy every print of this turkey. michael caine, who now pontificates endlessly on the art of screen acting - even running master classes for would-be thespians - should be taken out and shot (preferably by one of telly savalas' henchmen). angela cartwright, an actress i usually like (and whose name isn't even in the opening credits, poor soul), is ten years too old for her role, and her horrible matronly yellow prom dress must haunt her nightmares to this day. slumming it are karl malden and shirley knight - hopefully they collected a big pay packet to assuage their involvement. the whole film is a series of bad scenes, but one that especially sticks in my mind is the explosion which results in the "ceiling" (if an upside-down ship's deck can be termed as such) collapsing and a load of empty cardboard boxes falling through! ooh, how scary! really, really, terrible.

stodgy drama starring pat o'brien as a washed-up reporter who turns up at his ex-boss's house to ask for money to fund his son's operation, only to find him dead on the floor. since o'brien knows the identity of the culprit, he offers to take the rap in return for the money he needs. a decent premise is wasted on a film that pretends it has surprises, twists and turns, even though it really doesn't. performances are rotten across the board, the movie dresses itself up as a hard-boiled american noir but the mix of dodgy accents doesn't work, and the story is hardly gripping. and it contains possibly the least attractive screen kiss of all time.

a washed up reporter called bart crosbie (pat o' brien) blackmails gang boss heinz webber (george colouris) for the money to pay for his son to have a life saving operation. in return he agrees to turn himself in for the murder of his editor, whom the gang killed in order to prevent an incriminating story being printed about them.typical poverty-row b-pic of the time directed for far more than it's worth by terence fisher, who within months of making this would become one of the leading british horror film directors at the hammer studio. the script is far-fetched and teen idol tommy steele (guitar in hand) was drafted in to sing a poor rock and roll number called "the rebel" at a coffee bar that acts as a legitimate front for the gang's activities.

another eli roth in the making. self promoting, bad script writing excuse for a horror director. victor is as far from the new horror icon as mary poppins (reference to the disney score). what is going on here? you have marilyn manson opening and closing this piece of crap and chitty chitty bang bang all through it. can this even be called horror? horrible, yes, but horror is a stretch. david lynch should sue them for stealing the elephant man prosthetics. please stop these fan boy want to be directors now. the video directors already have enough competition breaking into the film industry. getting online and talking about how great your movie is does not make it true. stop the insanity. i work in the industry and yes these films are fun to work on, but rarely ever entertaining to actually watch.

this movie is one of the worse examples of hype. people who read imdb comments might be tempted to view this total waste of time, as i was, by false tag-lines like " a throwback to 80's horror" and what-not. this movie sucks, from the acting to the directing to the story. horrible, all across the board. and i really like good horror films, i am not at all a snob. this sucked. for reference, i loved the grudge 1 and 2, black sheep, planet terror, texas chaisaw massacre the beginning, the others, the ring, jason x, slither, planet terror, and really hated the ring 2, texas chainsaw massacre(re-make)wolf creek, the hills have eyes(re-make)hostel 1 and 2, and this movie. gore doesn't trump fun or originality.

i don't understand what the big hype was about this film. all the horror sites were saying that this movie had all the essentials of an 'old american slasher' flick that it would satisfy your needs. -- even though this was similar to an old american slasher flick, my needs were still not satisfied.my big problem with this movie is that we are now in the 2000's, not the 1980's. 1980's horror is the past and should stay in the past. horror movies have changed so much that older movies now look cheesy and unrealistic. even though they are fun to watch, they don't offer the same realistic blood thirsty gore that the recent films offer.hatchet is cheesy, unrealistic, and down-right awful. if we wanted to watch an old american slasher flick, i can just go back to the friday the 13th series, nightmare on elm street series, or the halloween series. i must admit, the movie is better than some of the horror movies being released but it is among the worst. the jokes are not funny and the actors are horrible.i would personally stay away from this movie and never look back.

i first heard of this movie at the "flashback weekend" in chicago 2007 for the "nightmare on elm street". robert englund was really talking the movie up and he was great in his part of "hatchet". the same can be said for tony todd. knowing this is a low budget first time director / writer it delivers every bit as much as the big budget and also cameo laden "holloween" (2007) remake/re-imagining.technically it falls short in a couple of places. the alligator attack seen was shoot too dark. when it happened the dark head of the alligator against the swamp clamping on to the black pants became almost invisible. the mood music in the swamp scenes was too loud in volume and canned, like a bad sitcom. and just like "holloween" (2007) someone is smart enough to have a gun, but of course shooting the killer is only a pause button for the killer. the ending, well, as soon as i saw where it was going i knew what was going to happen, not very original.the highlights of the movie are the characters and their interactions. unlike "holloween" (2007) we got to meet the people and care what happened to them. ben (joel moore, who is also the lead of "spiral")the sulking lead and marcus ("not another teen movie")as the best friend and funny man to root for during the movie. shapiro (joel murry "dharma & greg"), jenna (joleigh fioreavanti) and misty (mercedes mcnab of "buffy the vampire slayer: the series", "angel: the series" and "the addams family" movies) give a convoluted reason for topless women. mr. and mrs. permatteo played by television regulars (richard riehle "grounded for life", patrika darbo "step by step")as the older couple that you know don't stand a chance, even the tour guide shawn (parry shen) is a fleshed out character. i hope to see more from all involved in this film, but i think it will play better on home video than in the theater, sorry.

harry knowles has a quote right on the front cover of the dvd stating"the next icon of horror" really?!?!?!? i have heard a lot of hype surrounding this one but wasn't totally convinced. however i am a die hard horror fan and will give just about any horror movie a chance. no matter the budget or the rating cause ya never know where your gonna find the next gem. not here.not hatchet. hatchet is poorly conceived,poorly acted and un funny. just because you have the actors who played freddy jason and candyman and a buffy chic topless with tons of gore does not make you an expert on horror.sorry. i don't even want to describe the plot because it is so idiotic. honestly my money is on rob zombie. there is a man who knows old school horror. forget this trash.

this pointless film was a complete disappointment. none of the characters is likeable in the least, so you watch what befalls each without really caring. what was worst was renting this movie at a gay owned establishment only to find that this story of male hustlers was filled with homophobic young men engaged in plenty of scenes of straight sex and not one single scene of gay sex.

i watched this last night on sundance. altman must be the most hit or miss director of note ever. this show, despite its "star power" is utterly non-compelling, and its political insights--which i as a proud liberal in no way disagree with--are shallow and clunky, and seem ripped from the headlines of usa today, despite the fact it's coming out of the mouth of someone as esteemed as mario cuomo. the drama, as such, is not very dramatic, and the comedy is not funny. the only points of interest, really, are seeing how new yorkers live their lives, and the loyalty of a cast and crew to reassemble a show that keeps insisting has some cult following from 1988. sometimes it seems like altman's sole contribution to cinema has been the art of having all your actors talk at once, the effect of which is one feels depressingly like they're a stranger at a wedding.

in the only act of commonsense they have ever made, the nsw film & television office refused to fund this film. the producers kicked up a big stink & in a blaze of publicity took their production to victoria. apart from the lost work for technicians, nsw were lucky not to have been involved...the film fails on just about every level. the post modernism fails, the casting fails (what is rose byrne's character all about ? which 1 dimensional snarling nasty did hugo weaving channel ? what the hell is pia miranda's character doing?) and the story is a clichéd mess of contradictions. in fact, the story runs like a dragged out prelude rather than a complete plot line.it might have had a chance if the "pop culture meets depression" style was better thought out and executed. if the casting was quirkier, if the style was less serious ... if just about everything was different. apart from the usual excellence in costume, design & cinematography (like most australian films), the film is just a total miscue. at a reported budget in excess of $7m, "the tender hook" is a symptom of the malaise of the australian film industry - the wrong people and the wrong projects are getting funded. compare this mess with "noise" (under $2m), or "cedar boys" (under $1m) and you get the idea. the tough, interesting films are struggling for funding and the flabby, overblown projects with name casts are getting the bucks.the funding bodies who invested in this deserve to go the same way as hugo weaving's character at the end of the film.

the tender hook, or, who killed the australian film industry? case no. 278. this sorry excuse for a period drama takes a cast and idea with potential  rose byrne, pia miranda, hugo weaving, in a jazz-era gangster drama  and turns it into a sloppily paced and executed soporific. mcheath (weaving) is a boxing promoter and gangster and functioning illiterate; for no apparent reason he's given to singing bob dylan and leonard cohen songs before bouts. how post-modern. how stupid. anyway. there's a boxer, art (matthew le nevez), who becomes mcheath's latest protégé, over his unfortunately aboriginal stablemate alby (luke carroll).mcheath's flapper moll iris (byrne) makes the goo-goo eyes at him. sexual tension squelches under the surface. miranda plays daisy, a friend of iris's (these flower girls stick together) who keeps turning up in scenes unannounced. they practice dancing together and talk about "hooking up" with guys. in the 1920s. i stopped counting anachronisms after that. there's a subplot involving japanese beer and a backstory of broome pearl fishermen. i don't know what it was all about. for some reason that is not exactly (at all) explained, byrne puts cocaine in art's lemonade. mcheath thinks he's a drunk and sacks him. byrne plots and schemes to help him out again. she's a big one for the plotting and scheming. most of which causes trouble. mcheath's two gunsels, portly ronnie (john batchelor) and russian donnie (tyler coppin), debate bumping off mcheath when he realises their part in one of iris's schemes, but ronnie wimps out when he sees mcheath crying. a lot of practically incoherent scenes get in the road of the film finally ending.director jonathan ogilvie spends a lot of time working with cinematographer geoffrey simpson creating some pretty images, but utterly fails to generate a sense of style, which might have compensated for and decorated the wispy, pathetically underpowered script; unfortunately ogilvie's sense of film grammar, the lack of structuring of the scenes and exposition, is stunningly incompetent. in an early scene, daisy suddenly appears in the car with the protagonists. how she got there, and indeed who she is, seems to have slipped ogilvie's mind. there are many more examples of this sloppiness. where he chases poetic sparseness, he achieves only wan irritation. he gains awkward performances from actors who are normally reliable, badly miscasting weaving and leaning on byrne's ability to project a kind of haunted doll-like humanity whilst saddling her with an incomprehensible character.it might not matter so much if the story had more substantial characters and stronger plotting preferably not stolen from a dozen old noir films and festooned with witlessly sprinkled pop-culture quotes. but it doesn't. it's boring.

whenever i see a video like this, i have to ask myself how it was financed. hbo or showtime or whatever must pay for the production company to go through the motions -- to hire someone who may or may not actually speak english to get high and hammer out something approaching a plot, to pay strippers with terrifying boob jobs to bounce up and down on grossly waxed dudes' torsos, to find people to design and light sets, to purchase the rights to cheesy techno music, etc. but i have to imagine this has to be a vanity project for whoever's serving as executive producer... he had to have nailed all of those girls, right? and bro's not wrong about the "spanish looking" girl, but to call the cops "stunning" is awfully generous. in fact, i'd go so far as to call them something much closer to "hideous," or "fugly." watching these women writhe around -- sometimes *clearly* high on pain killers -- was so far from erotic that my testicles actually ascended inside of my body. gross.why waste time with this when there's so much freely available hardcore porn on the internet? i wonder whether the popularization of internet video will slowly kill the softcore video industry... one can only hope, right?

there's nothing wrong with softcore but this one is pretty clinical - lots of nudity but it's all fake (of course, it's always fake - it's a movie but you know what i mean). there's no sexuality or erotica, it's all random nudity and poor acting of "lust" and sex with each other.part of it is of course, your personal preference. these women clearly have some body issues with their piercings, tattoos and silicon - not to mention that overly plastique & leathery look so if that's your thing - great, you get to see all that here.i don't think anyone's expectations are very high when looking at a movie title such as this but for many people, it would be pretty much like looking at cyborg fembots ... they almost seem real but it's really more creepy.

it is amazing what you can see if you wake at 2 am and turn on the telly. i didn't know they showed films like this. i immediately thought of roger corman, who reused locations for movies or used other films locations for his own movies.the makes of this film could just move the camera angles and add some time and they would have an xxx film.there was no story, just minimum dialog that led to stripping and sex. i bet there wasn't 100 words in the whole film, but there sure was a lot of very large busts and hot lesbian action. there was male/female action too, but it was only about 25% of the movie.another interesting thing came to mind in watching this film that may interest those who are buying hi def dvds. sony refused to license betamax to adult film makers and adult films came out on vhs. you can guess what happened to beta max as the adult film industry makes millions of videos. sony has again refused to license blu-ray to the adult film industry and they have just signed a deal with toshiba. you can guess which high def system will disappear.

"air bud 2: golden receiver" is a very bad rehearse in making a sequel in the course of a single year. the first film was cute, cuddly and charming. the idea of a dog playing on a basketball team is quite far fetched, but he defiantly pulled off enough stunts to save the concept. even the human story had some explanation to it. josh's father was killed in a plane crash, so he is sad. and the audience becomes emotionally involved as well.now for the poorly made sequel. it is terrible. this is the worst kind of bad sequel, the kind that changes the good ideas and turns them into bad ones. the kind that changes the main plot piece in one way, this time, the k-9 plays football instead of basketball. no madder how much time is spent in mind over matter, benefit of a doubt, walk into with an open mind of an attitude you have with a film like this, there is no positive thinking when it comes to down right bad film making.the sequel stars kevin zegers as josh, who is in eight grade. he lives with his mother and little sister in a seattle suburb. in the first film the human story involved him losing his father in a plane accident, which the audience can relate to, most people know what it feels like to lose a close loved one. in this movie, the emotional plot is a bit more complicated. josh's mother is dating once again. he and buddy, his dog who can play basketball, don't like this at all. why? if i were in his shoes i would love to have an extra parent in my life, especially one this nice. the man's name is patrick sullivan, and josh's mother, jackie, met him became he is a local veterinarian for buddy.the animal story is too simple. josh is influenced by his best friend to try out for the school football team, the timber wolves. the team itself looks like something from america's funniest home videos, the can even catch a ball without tripping or plummeting into each other. so when bud shows up one day, he proves he can play as a receiver for them, and is no doubt the team's best player.buddy's extremely cute in his football costume. oh, he is enough to melt the heart. the dog is the best in this movie as well. too bad there wasn't enough stunts done by him to draw attention away from the fact that no one ever asks any questions about a dog playing off a school football team.there is a very bad sub-plot about russian circus workers that like stealing amazing animals, of course they try to catch buddy. but their dim minds are ruled over by the animals and end up doing what looks like a "home alone" scenario to them."air bud 2: golden receiver" is much more goofy than the first too. the russian kidnappers add a bunch of lamebrain slapstick that, i have to admit made me laugh, at the stupidity of it all. there are way too many sequences that detail a screwball nature and too few scenes that depict the true reason why people will see this movie-to see a dog play football.the performances were also quite the embarrassment. i liked gregory harrison and robert costanzo's presentations, but the overall acting grade would be equivalent to a d+. kevin zegers and cynthia stevenson were absolutely pathetic.there were a few hilarious moments near the end by a couple of football announcers, but that isn't even worth mentioning. will children enjoy this movie? perhaps, but even they will grow weary when the heart felt discussions become too long and deep. they will most certainly complain that the dog didn't get enough screen time in, and loath over the fast changing script, and protest against the boring performances, and argue that this movie is trash in comparison the origami al "air bud," as i did.i suppose that they will think the dog is adorable.

this is without a doubt the worst sequel i have ever seen, & i've seen plenty of them to make that conclusion. the plot is simply ridiculous. i can catch a ball & run around a field, too. why can't i play in the superbowl? yes i know this movie was intended for children, but there are just some plots that even children can realize are totally dumb & unrealistic. the first air bud movie was pretty good, but this one was a total crash. disney is loosing it. if i controlled who won the razzie awards, i would give this one a couple. have a nice day! =)

[warning: some spoilers included, though it is a documentary.]i bought this documentary because i like the work of the directors d.a. pennebaker and chris hegedus, which includes moon over broadway, startup.com and the war room., all terrific documentaries i would highly recommend. watching this ultimately boring and uninsightful account from depeche mode's 1988 tour, i realized they had nothing to work with when they went to edit this film together. the band members were certainly less than forthcoming on-camera; hence, undoubtedly, the contest to add fans on a one-week bus trip was added to liven things up a bit. really, now, i mean, c'mon. who thought a concert film of a synth-pop band with three keyboardists and a singer would be a good idea? granted, i like depeche mode's music, and martin gore writes good melodies, but seeing them in concert never seemed like it would be interesting, and this movie is proof positive. unless you are a huge fan of depeche mode, stay away from this documentary....it's a complete waste of time.

as a massive fan of dm, it goes without saying that i have seen this film numerous times. however, i watch it purely for the concert footage...the rest of the film is, um, pretty dreadful, sad to say.famed rock music film director da pennebaker followed mode around on their late 80s music for the masses tour, which promoted the superb album of the same name. the title 101 derives mostly from the fact that the concert material included is from the 101st and final concert of the tour at the pasadena bowl, but is also a reference to the movie being a 'beginners course' on the band and how it ticks ie depeche mode 101. amidst footage of the quartet playing live and exploring america is a second story thread covering a group of dm fans who've won a competition to meet the band, go on the tour in their own coach bus and attend the finale gig.now, as i said above, the concert footage is great. mode are here on top of their form as stadium rock gods, which was a somewhat unusual achievement for an electrorock band back in the late 80s. though the film catches the band before they recorded their 1990 masterpiece "violator", there are still countless excellent tracks seen and heard here eg behind the wheel, the majestic never let me down again, everything counts, just can't get enough from the vince clarke years, shake the disease and many more.when mode are onstage, they are brilliant. when they are not, they're, well, very boring. nothing even vaguely of interest happens to the lads as they check out the us in the dying days of the reagan administration. as an example, the probable "highlight" of the material is a visit to a country music store to buy cassettes. not exactly thrilling stuff. i know all bands don't have to be wild and reckless idiots, but these guys make the mormon tabernacle choir look like rammstein.the only real excitement comes from various clips centring on the band's lead singer dave gahan. gahan comes across in 101 as being mildly psychotic, talking about a violent power inside himself he can't control, recalling a bizarre rage attack involving a taxi driver and so on. there's one point in the film where he throws a prima donna tantrum at some poor guy backstage - truly embarrassing. the man clearly had issues back then, which thankfully have been resolved. songwriter martin gore and keyboardist andy fletcher are presented as very articulate, clearly massively talented, but also utterly colourless men; while the somewhat enigmatic fourth member alan wilder is the only one of the quartet who pulls off the rock star persona with any sort of aplomb.and as for the 'fan tour' thread, well it's unwatchable dross. let's not kid ourselves. maybe it's just because it's all so *very* late 80s, but the gaggle of young devotees do little for me but raise a feeling of irritation. they are, to a person, singularly shallow and vapid people, whose antics are banal when they aren't hide-your-face cringeworthy. let me reiterate....*nothing* happens in the footage that isn't onstage that is of any interest. nothing. endless scenes of kids spraying their hair, arguing pointlessly, changing their clothes, getting lost in cities on the way to gigs and finding their partners in bed with another competition winner makes me wonder just one thing - if cure fans were this mind bendingly dull back in '88/89. the love the youngsters have for the band is something i can definitely relate to, and is at times infectiously joyous, but if what we see was the most interesting stuff out of what was filmed of them, then i'd hate to see the outtakes.but the music is all that matters, and in this regard 101 excels. the pasadena concert, one of their all time best gigs, makes the film worth seeing. the recent dvd edition of the movie comes with a bonus disc containing what remains of the unedited concert footage (a good 80% of the performance), and thus makes the dvd an absolute must for fans. the audio commentary by the band (minus wilder, who left mode in the mid-90s) on the first disc is also, oddly, far more interesting than the film itself.as a document of the boys from basildon during their amphitheatre idol period, depeche mode 101 is invaluable. but if you're looking for excitement, you're better off getting the accompanying double live album (now available in super audio cd format).

the plane is a 747 jumbo. the cockpit is located on the upper deck on a 747. in the movie the pilots do not climb the stairs in the 1st class cabin to reach the cockpit. they walk to the front of the 1st class cabin and through doors into the cockpit. what a gaff !!! the front of the first class cabin has a cloakroom for jackets and a tv screen. beyond that is the radar dome. before takeoff a 747 is shown to commence the taxi to the runway. on take-off the plane is shown to have only two engines. areal 747 has four engines. who was in charge of continuity on this movie ? during the early part of the flight the front of the plane suddenly includes toilets - another farcical gaff !!! after that the front of the plane becomes the rear and vice-versa. at this point i stopped watching. absolute rubbish!!!

i would have given this film a one star vote had it not been for the laughs i got out of it. some of the dialogs were just plain so lame that they make you laugh!! how could some one have actually talked like this. not to mention the fact that the bodyguard majors (antonio sabato jr.) flew a 747 like a pro and michael pare's team of whiners were able to dig a trench filled with gasoline and blow up a huge boulder in the nick of time. did anyone notice the lame tribute to "fantasy island" with the guy saying "boss, the plane!!" to michael pare just as the 747 comes in sight.the only saving grace were the cute girls and even cuter female hijackers. not to mention that the main hijacker deserved to die the lame death that he did for being such a joker!! imagine escaping from being tied up just to shot by a "crossbow". hello.the poor pilot probably died in the plane while everyone was eating steak and having rum!! just for laughs, they should make a sequel to show us how they all spend the night in the midst of a category 3 hurricane on neptune atoll. did i hear michael pare calling it the "best honeymoon resort in the pacific." now that would make an interesting movie!!

maybe this movie was actually intended to be satire like 'airplane' but it failed at that as miserably as it failed at being a 'thriller'. i don't understand why they couldn't have paid an actual pilot a couple hundred bucks for a little technical advice. hell, i would have done it for free! this magical aircraft managed to morph from a 757 to a 767 to a 747 in an hour and the power levers worked backward. and the dialog sounds like it came out the back end of a kid's game of 'telephone' where everyone spoke different languages. i actually rewound the tivo and watched some of it a second time to see if it was really as bad as i thought at first. it was.

i have seen three other movies that are worse than this one, "plan 9 from outerspace", "side hackers" and the dreaded "blair witch project" there are so many technical errors in this movie that regardless of a decent plot the movie just isn't believable.let's start with an amtrak train with no skirts or handrails between cars. the killer walks up behind his victim as she moves from car to car and just pushes her off the train.in one scene a killer sneaks into a woman's apartment. he wants to sneak up on the woman to kill her, so what does he do? he turns up her stereo! if i heard my stereo suddenly get louder i'd be concerned. he kills the women by throwing an electric hair curler into the tub. i was amazed to see that an electric hair curler with a five foot cord could be tossed ten feet and remain plugged in. plus the apartment looked modern enough to have ground fault outlets in the bathroom and the victim was still electrocuted.the boeing 747 is one of the most well known commercial airliners on the planet so this part really amazed me. first the cockpit was not even close to a real 747 and second it wasn't on the top deck of the plane. i watched in utter amazement as the pilot and co-pilot (where was the flight engineer?) walked right past the spiral staircase and headed forward toward's the nose of the airplane.i was also amazed that bullets wouldn't penetrate an aluminum serving cart (good thing for our hero), or bathroom doors, but would penetrate the ceiling causing a fuel leak that exited through a small hole in the fuselage. huh? watching three guys lengthen a runway by 100 yards in less than a week was pretty amazing as well.i didn't check, was this a movie of the week or something? it was terrible.

you have to see this. i could not stop laughing about the stupidities i saw in this movie even late after the event. there is maybe a million of individual mistakes and stupidities in this movie. the acting is bad. the story is so predictable and flat. the effects are like 50 years old. the supposed thriller is nowhere. you will not enjoy the movie, but you will laugh at it and enjoy laughing at it a long time after it. we had a great time after the movie. truly. me and my friend spent entire 40mins long bus trip home chatting about this movie like we have seen next oscar winner. sadly we were talking about all those bad things we had just seen.

my suggestion..... this movie was really intended to be a "comedy",wasn't it?!!!! if not, the producers, directors, actors & "hair stylists" should really choose another career! now, the guidelines of my submission requires a minimum of "10 lines". how in the world can i add any more to this? hmm...let me see. oh yes, the beginning of the movie was quite hilarious with the "crash landing" scene. too bad that the plane didn't hit the tanker truck & a bunch of "martians" would have scrambled out from the wreckage (obviously hiding) and decided to take over the "world" planet and make a better movie. now, that would have been a great beginning!t

i can't believe that someone actually paid to have this film made. stupid, unrealistic, and stereotypical. right from the take off of the massive 747 the pilot pulled the throttles back to increase speed. then you have 5 armed persons with semi to fully automatic weapons firing without so much as one bullet breaching the walls of the pressurized cabin at 38,000 feet. then once below in the belly of the plane a stray bullet hits a fuel line and we see the fuel leaking from the side of the plane. the acting was just horrid and forced. there just didn't seem to be any direction. i have seen some pretty horrid b movies in my lifetime but with the names that were in this film i was extremely disappointed.

the idea that anyone could of concocted such a trite, cliché, yet indeliberately comical movie is shocking. the final 20 minutes of this film are comical glory; with six men digging enough trench in 10 minutes to light the runway with gasoline for a 747, while a supposed 'major' perfectly lands the 747 in a 110mph crosswind - leading one to question the misnomer of calling this movie crash landing...some of the dialogue was equivalent to rubbing sandpaper in my ears, while the only aspect that saved this movie for a 1 was the plethora of attractive women filling the screen a large portion of the time. not exactly a consolidation for this pathetic excuse of a movie, but my mute button finally received a workout.view at your own risk! 2 out of 10

hilarious!! i would have sworn ed wood wrote this. terrible. i loved every frame. bad movie aficionado's, this is your trophy! i will watch it again. words cannot explain how entertaining this movie is. pare's career must have dipped low, but i really think he's heading in the leslie nielson direction. he was perfect for this. terrible, just terrible!! you'll love it!! get some friends, lots of beer, and you'll have the time of your life. it's an mst3000 party, waiting to happen. enjoy!! it is worth the rental!! you like the "colombo type" cop and the comic relief coroner. the bad guy will have you on the floor laughing. he's also in another pare movie, komodo vs cobra, and he's just as good there. i don't know what the budget was but they'll get it back because this film is destined to be the best unintended comedy of the year.

aghhhhhh! what a disappointment. a perfectly good hunk like antonio sabato jr and nothing but embarrassing drivel coming out of his mouth. i cringed at 95% of the dialog! it would have been better to have made the character a mute! how antonio sabato and michael pare could speak those lines without losing control of some bodily function is beyond me! if michale pare's character prefaced or ended just one more sentence with the word 'men' i think i would have thrown the iron through the tv set (i love to multitask - especially to get through bad movies). must have been a lean year for both of them to sign up for this movie. washing cars for a living would probably look pretty good to them by now. and the bad guy......if he was so bad why didn't he just shoot all those rich college kids instead of promising toilet breaks. even the title was a misnomer. a 'crash landing' means the plane actually crashes and doesn't just land without even a token fire or anyone being injured. instead of landing safely the plane should have crashed and burned just like the script.this movie is a stinker !

this movie is so bad it's worth seeing. this movie will have viewers lapsing in and out of a coma within the first 10 minutes. it all started when a bunch of writers came up with the idea of a jetliner being hijacked and a passenger who can fly a small plane has to land the beast. however, they know it's been done before many times so to make it different, let's do it very badly! major masters has his name pirated from 80's movie "to live and die in l.a." from character played by willem dafoe. that saved 10 minutes in writing and production time. the plane is supposed to be a boieng 747. that plane has a unique silhouette, even in the dark with its characteristic forward hump on the top. just ask the late ronald reagan who lamented this point when them ruskies shot down kal 007 in the eighties. yet when the plane takes off it's clearly not a 747 looks more like a 767. this well researched film also forgets to include the engineer's seat in the cockpit and replaces it with two comfy rumble seats. no need for a flight engineer on this complex plane! heroine is played by perpetually pouting gloria lynn berg. after tying up the hijacker, despite several bus-loads of people on this jumbo jet, nobody bothers to watch this guy who almost killed all of them. he's just forced to amuse himself.the crippled plane, leaking fuel from all the hijacking shenanigans won't make it back to hawaii so masters will try to land at an air force base located on an island. only the runway's 300 feet too short! four army guys with little bobcats (the kind you rent to take all day moving a load of horse manure to the back of your barn), are gonna clear a 200 foot wide and 300 foot long swath through the jungle in 20 minutes! no need for a bulldozer here! where can you find guys like this? these guys could make a highway between los angeles and las vegas in 3 hours equipped only with tablespoons, a compass and a duck!after that hellish obstacle is fixed, masters will try to land the plane as heroine pouts away. hijacker giggles to himself and unsupervised gets free to make more trouble. he is finally subdued in a most retarded manner that i can't tell you. but, can you say moby dick?there are so many retarded scenes in this movie. the wounded captain is parked prone on the bar on the plane while masters, who supposedly can barely fly, puts the plane into 60 degree banks and 20,000 feet per minute drops. the pilot should be french kissing the ceiling during these challenging stunts, but doesn't budge an inch. i think that if they had picked different actors to play the parts, this moving could have been way better. if we need a pouting heroine in the movie, why not pick better known actress bernadette peters who seems to be perpetually pouting as well? besides, she can sing and the busty well aging peters could feature some gratuitous cleavage shots. now with the singing angle this could be a hijacking, let's land the plane movie musical! cast luciano pavarotti as the pilot. they can sing a duet in the cockpit prior to the hijacking and there's no way that tubby tenor would fly up to the ceiling as masters works his magic on that big bird. in keeping with the musical theme, masters could then be played by andrei bocelli, that peters can sing with as he lands the plane. not only is he totally blind but only knows a couple of words of english. now that's a plot! think of the edge of your seat conversation between masters (bocelli) and the air traffic controller:atc: "sir, please throttle back to 180, flaps set to 25 degrees. maintain 230 heading"bocelli: "what?"atc: "sir, arm spoilers now, confirm brake pressure at 250 psi. maintain descent at 500 fpm"bocelli: "what?"the hijacker could have been played by the late great rodney dangerfield who can spew a plethora of his one liners as he sits tied up and unguarded: "i get no respect. my wife is into group sex. yeah, she screwed me in front of the judge and jury!" get the idea?missed opportunities the movie has your standard crying and moaning passengers that are never developed. woody allen could have been at the back offering one of his neurotic monologues: "she said i was great in bed. i told her i practice myself a lot..." now this is a movie!also, according to similar movie "executive decision" where lazy eyed steven segal is mercifully killed at the start giving that movie a chance, 747's have massive attics up top. the plane was introduced in 1969 so who knows what has accumulated in almost 40 years up there? my uncle has old clothes, a sled, magazines and all sorts of stuff in his. wouldn't it have been cool if masters opened the trap door and saw a teary eyed chevy chase in a woman's housecoat watching old super 8 movies of his childhood? just a recommendation.so give it a chance, and as u lapse in and out of consciousness imagine how great this movie could have been if i had my hand in it...

i should have gone without seeing the movie after reading the review here. i saw the whole movie by fast forwarding and ended in 25 minutes. though its a low budget movie it could have been made better. the movie starts more like a thriller and in few minutes it tells you that you should switch off immediately. and why was the movie named "crash landing" when it was landed so well in such a bad climate. without any acting, all the characters where just moving or doing like kids.and should not forget to comment on the joker - the main hijacker who would have been more suitable if this movie was a full time comedy.

this film was embarrassing in its clichés, poor acting and generally low production values. it starts out badly with the long haired 3 star general calling the hero, masters, "major" when he is obviously wearing the silver oak leaves of lieutenant colonel. but what was most distressing was the crew of soldiers on neptune atoll. how out of touch with any kind of reality can you get? they were all experts on flying a 747 and the scenes of the soldiers digging the ditch were beyond comical.warning: this film is dangerous to your intellectual health! watch at your own peril!

i gave this film a 2 mostly because it does actually have an ok cast but the film itself is just so (insert unusually rude word beginning with the sixth letter of the alphabet)-ing pointless that i felt bad that at the time i voted for it its lowest vote was a three.very predictable plot....two nare-do-well musicians have no money and plenty of money problems. however when a friend leaves a bag full of money (that belongs to drug dealers) in their care they of course spend it and then the "fun" begins.not an original idea in this whole film.

if you're not a fan of the 80s, and you need to be a particularly strong fan, or of one of the two leads, there's nothing about this film to recommend.the story, as others have said, is dull, almost an afterthought to the basic notion of the characters and the idea of making a slightly manic comedy. i watched it to about an hour, hoping it would turn a corner, a twist would occur or it would somehow kick into gear but no... it's not unwatchable, it's just dull. it goes by. it goes by with bits of running around madly, lingering shots of feet at strange angles, bits of shouting madly but i didn't get a real feel of energy or manic fun, it just came across as forced. needless to say also, there was nothing to laugh at particularly. a bit of mild amusement here or there but nothing more.don't be fooled by the mention of feminism by the way, all it means in this case is that almost all the principal cast is female. if anything, it's actually cloying... two female leads, fine, excellent, the drug dealer is female, okay, their landlord is a landlady, alright, their friends are female, okay, the only other person we particularly see who lives in the same building, oh, female... i wasn't on the lookout for that but after a while it felt like a conscious decision had been made to have the film cast that way and it felt, again, a bit forced and cloying.on the plus-side, if you are a fan of 80s fashions and culture, there is plenty to see and if you're a fan of helen slater, she's fun and enjoyable to watch. there's also some screen-time for carol kane, which is great, but not enough...overall: 3/10. if you're a huge fan of the 80s, helen slater and carol kane, you could maybe stretch it to a 5 because of them, although there's still the fact it's a comedy which isn't funny, which hinders it substantially. if you're not a fan of those things, you might as well make it 0 because there's nothing much else to enjoy here.

i want to say that i went to this movie with my expectations way too high. i thought it was going to be funny because it's the sequel to bruce almighty which was really funny and it stars steve carell who is an excellent comedic actor but boy, did it sucked.the movie is advertised as a sequel but it really has nothing to do with the original since the only people reprising their roles are morgan freeman and steve carell but steve's character is completely different, he is no longer the jerk he was in the first one here he is a nice guy. the story is different and the actors are different and it's not funny.all the actors involved(steve carell, morgan freeman, wanda sykes, john goodman, ed helms and even jon stewart in a very crappy cameo) have talent but none of them seems to use it and it looks that there in the movie just for the money.now the plot is obviously shaped after noah's story but there are so many wrong things with it, i don't know where to start. i guess the big problem is that in the everyone around evan thinks that he is crazy despite all the things that are happening to him, he grows a huge white beard in two days, he gets help from animals from all around the world, he builds a giant arc in a few weeks, in real life people wouldn't be mocking these guy after that, they would be saying he is the new noah.also the special effects are good but what the hell is the greatest movie flood ever filmed doing in evan almighty? did they really had to waste such good special effects as filler for this crappy movie.jim carrey seems to be a smart guy since he has stayed away of three of the worst sequels ever made, son of the mask, dumb and dumbered and now evan almighty.this was a giant disappointment and tom shyadac should be ashamed of himself.

this film is definitely up there with the worst films i've ever seen, probably in my top 5 of worst films. i laughed once and that was when:evan: "im building something" evan's secretary: "i hope its a barber shop"that was literally the only time i laughed in this 'comedy', awful compared to bruce almighty which as a big jim carrey fan...wasn't even that great! this movie lacked the humour of having god's powers and was more about family bonding. id class it solely as a family movie, definitely not a family comedy. seeing a bird poo on someone's shirt is not hilarious, neither is a beard that grows back instant!i didn't even think the special effects were great, the animals looked really stuck on, it was like watching a film which hadn't been 'glued' together properly2/10 film - avoid!

evan almighty (2007) ** steve carell, morgan freeman, lauren graham, johnny simmons, graham phillips, jimmy bennett, john goodman, wanda sykes, john michael higgins, jonah hill, molly shannon, ed helms, (cameo: jon stewart as himself) strained 'sequel' to "bruce almighty" with carell's jerk anchorman evan baxter leaving tv to begin his stint as a freshman congressional rep has his hands full when god (freeman reprising his holy role; jim carrey wisely avoided the 'calling') demands he build an ark like noah and the hilarity ensues (or should have). the godforsaken sitcom-y script by steve oedekerk, joel cohen & alec sokolow is absolutely lame and only carell's amiable persona transcends his vain evan into something resembling a human being. the end result is a lot of bird poop gags and overall bloat (reportedly costing $175 m for the cgi f/x). sykes steals the show as evan's sarcastic assistant. sacrilegiously unfunny. (dir: tom shadyac)

was this supposed to be funny? this is one of those films that just doesn't work. the first one, bruce almighty with jim carey, had some very funny moments. this one had none.steve carrell, who was brilliant in bruce almighty, fails to deliver here. his performance is very ordinary and he can't carry it off like carey did.the one good thing about this is i only paid $1.95 to rent it. it's a movie for children...very young children who have only seen about 4 films or so in their short lives.it's interesting to note that where jim carey stars in a film and they make a sequel without him that it's usually a huge turkey. anyone remember son of mask? (imdb worst 100 films of all time) avoid this one movie lovers.

evan almighty continues the mainstream bruce almighty franchise, this time with newsman turned freshman congressman from buffalo, evan baxter (steve carell), at it's center. a wholly innocuous (and not even really self-doubting) man, god (morgan freeman) decides to enforce some sort of quest upon baxter, in order to illustrate the importance of... reciprocal kindness, so that baxter can "change the world" (aka, pay it forward).think of evan almighty as a wholesome derivative of 'distinguished gentlemen.' baxter is not a con, but his colleague, congressman long (john goodman) wants his unquestioned support on a bill that essentially, is harmful to the environment. and well-meaning baxter, knowing the importance of networking and visibility, is willing to support him. in addition, with the new job comes more responsibility, and baxter is in a sense, vilified, for not spending enough time with his family. so god, decides to give evan baxter some guidance by forcing him to become the modern day noah. his orders: build an ark. except, while it may be mildly humorous to see baxter's transformation to the "weirdo with a beard-o," there doesn't seem to be much point to this whole thing which becomes abundantly clearer when the climax of the film fizzles. (spoilers: if none of the population is killed by the "flood", then what was the point of summoning the animals... or at least the ones that obviously weren't from suburban virginia? or, more importantly, if all baxter had to realize was that long's projects faltered in their quality, then why did he have to build an ark?).so, although a comedy like this needn't be a hysterical laugh-riot, it was certainly one made far less enjoyable as it was crammed with far too many homilies (and not all from morgan freeman) and action that seemed intended for a film of more epic events.

the creative team behind evan almighty really should have been able to make a better film. starring one of america's favourite funnymen and helmed by ace ventura pet detective director tom shadyac one expects a higher laugh count than the picture provides. hell even steve oedekerk who wrote and directed last years atrocious barnyard, and attains a writing credit here has done better work. the fact of the matter is that evan almighty isn't the worst picture of the summer season but it might well be the most disappointing. the title and creative team behind the picture suggest this is a sequel of sorts to 2003's bruce almighty. that picture had jim carrey in the lead, and whilst both steve carell and carrey are both funny guys it's the latter who's better suited to this sort of material. i've heard that carrey was offered this sequel before anyone else, but the actor declined staing he saw no other places for his character to venture. thus shadyac moved over to carell, who ever since an amusing bit part in the 2003 original has been gunning for stardom. after sleeper hits the 40 year old virgin and little miss sunshine the man has become big business, and so it's him rather than rubber faced jim who leads this production into theatres. the story see's evan baxter (steve carell) having been elected as a congressman and thus he and his troop move house and state so evan can find success with his job. his wife (lauren graham) and three kids have doubts but overall show a supportive side towards evan, who himself looks at the future with optimistic eyes. however things start to go belly up fairly fast, god (morgan freeman) appears to evan stating a flood is coming and that the politician must build an ark. initially ignoring the encounter, evan is quickly granted some robes a beard that refuses to stay shaved and animals are beginning to appear two by two. evan then begins to put the boat into construction but the neighbourhood aren't happy and neither is a fellow politician (john goodman). anyone expecting the wacky laughs of some of tom shadyac's other films will probably be left completely cold by this movie. ace ventura, liar liar and hell even bruce almighty where largely very funny pictures, but all of those ;projects have one thing in commen and thats jim carrey's presence. shadyac hasn't made a worthwhile film without carrey at the helm, he's worked with robin williams, eddie murphy and now steve carell, but still only carrey seems to meld successfully with shadyac. carell after the disappointing box-office and critical mauling won't be desperate to work with the director again, and with carrey now doing more serious projects shadyac had better find a new comic muse fast. carell himself is fairly dull here, whoever felt that his bit part in the first movie (despite being quite amusing) deserved a full length feature should be taken out back and shot. i expect after bruce almighty's box-office draw it was universal studios themselves, but you know when a quality comedian can't do anything with a character then the scren persona is a dud, and thats exactly the case with evan almighty. lauren graham isn't any great shakes as evan's wife nor do any of the children strike the right note. freeman lets it all hang loose as god in another amusing and chilled performance but he appears to sporadically to carry the piece. indeed the most consistent source of laughter is evan's secretary (wanda sykes) and creep co-worker (jonah hill), both made me laugh twice as much as any other character in the project. oedekerk's writing has been worse (barnyard) but also better (ace ventura when nature calls) than his work on this production. his script does have genuinely funny moments but it's also full of cloying family moments and the humour is never weird or indeed offensive enough. the film takes tame and easy swipes at religion when it ought to rip the concept to shreds, indeed the opening church sequence in the simpsons movie shakes religion harder than evan almighty's whole 95 minute run. with a bit more daring and heart this could have been a far better picture. i don't doubt that the core family audience will be mildly entertained by this film, but if they'll be satisfied is a completely different question. there's a line between being watchable and being worthwhile, a line that evan almighty is always on the wrong side off. maybe when you're feeling bored and the films on cable you can afford to watch, but i can think of plenty better ways to spend my time and indeed more importantly my money than tuning into this mediocre comedy.

i like to think that i can appreciate a movie that is a bit out of the ordinary, and i certainly love a good movie that makes me think.if you like out of the ordinary movies that make you think, then look elsewhere. this movie is so bad and so disjointed that the only thing you will be thinking after it is over is how it is possible you wasted 90 minutes of your life watching this.a movie of this kind needs a driver to get buy in from the viewer. why are we interested in the main characters? what motivates these characters through their existence? why do they make the decisions they make? this movie makes a very weak attempt at doing these and fails in the process. there is no chemistry between these two actors, both of who are superb in their ability to be comfortable in any role. so why did they fail here? i strongly feel that they didn't know what their motivations were either, and when an actor doesn't know, their audience can't follow.in sum, i have seen macromedia flash videos that offered more in the way of provoking thought, at least i have more interest in the morphed hamster who likes the moon than why this married family man would risk it all for a "code 46" violation.

there is nothing worse than science fiction crafted by folks who don't have a feel for it. grasping at a concept which wouldn't be so terrible by itself (a future where cloning is common enough that it is necessary to make it a crime for you to breed with someone too close to you genetically) the screenwriter proceeded to allow his ill-suited imagination to run wild.when tim robbins' character was able to guess a security guard's computer password simply by getting her to tell him one thing about herself, i knew i was in for trouble. this ability was later revealed to be due to robbins having taken an "empathy virus", viruses being used to grant instant (or nearly instant) skill upgrades to their users. robbins' love interest complained about her own experience with such a virus -- a mandarin chinese language virus, which allowed her to speak chinese, but as she complained, "she couldn't understand what she was saying." okay, first off, empathy, no matter how intense, isn't esp. without incorporating some sort of true mind-reading aspect (like an empathy virus which actively releases virions into the vicinity, infects nearby people, picks up bits of their memory, then departs for the original host -- which is, as you can probably tell, a smidgeon on the impractical side) you can't justify being able to determine a specific detail like someone's password just by "listening to the things you didn't say". nor can you acquire the ability to speak a language without understanding what you're saying -- the virus can't infect your vocal cords and translate for you on the fly, because a virus can't *think*. to give you the power to speak chinese, such a learning virus would have to modify your brain. it would have to encode the knowledge among neurons, and once it's in there, it's *yours* -- you certainly understand what you're saying, because you have to. to use your own brain to perform a task, you must understand that task (for the most part). unless, of course, they movie is suggesting that the virus was deliberately designed to put in place some bizarre multiple-personality mental schism where some sub-personae of yours functions as a built-in, one-way translator.the mélange of languages spoken by the characters is decent enough, although nowhere near remarkable enough to warrant all the love other reviewers have given. what's more, all the multicultural insertions in the world can't make up for a simple, frustrating fact: the dialog stinks! it's slow, it's plodding, and it's unnatural. again, i'm sure adherents have convinced themselves that the dull strangeness is simply the result of an inspired genius creating a truly futuristic (and therefore subjected to linguistic drift) form of speech. i disagree. good dialog is good dialog in any era -- and the same goes for tripe.lastly, i'll revisit the central concept of the movie -- the banning of sex with yourself. widespread cloning is a nice, classic sci-fi topic. so is global warming leading to ecological devastation (which code 46 also incorporates). unfortunately, the two don't go together! if you have an ecological disaster cutting down severely on the available living area, you don't run around cloning people! you have population problems enough as it is -- you don't add to them by cranking out re-issues. regular, old-fashioned sex-and-birth provides all the population you need, and cloning of any sort would be ruthlessly suppressed.to be fair, the movie wasn't all bad. it had some nice cinematography. perhaps if i had watched it muted, i could've enjoyed it.

i thought this film was a poor effort by the british film council - fell flat as hey, come on, tim robbins is an old guy and here is this beautiful young woman who falls straight for him as well. like lost in translation its really hard to suspend disbelief in this context. it's a good looking film but lacks punch. when tim robbins is pretending to be psychic it looks like he has a small migraine. he looks uncomfortable and life less. the part where he is screening suspect employees at sphinx is laughable. if an investigator came to my factory the last thing i would do is tell him about my freckle fetish. it's obviously over-intellectual. clumsy. the city is as it is, a convenient backdrop. they obviously picked the most futuristic city they could (shanghai) as a backdrop but the city never really comes out and effects the characters as in for example blade runner, where the characters of the city often intersect the story. slow as a wet week. no chemistry, real dramatic high points, so so plot.

***spoilers*** ***spoilers***i saw this movie last night at a screening. i started out already liking tim robbins and loving sci-fi. the first third of the movie was very cool. the score was good, the cinematography was interesting, the film maker's vision of the future was realistic yet starkly interesting nonetheless. i remember thinking to myself: "this is the most intelligently done sci-fi movie i've seen in a while". then they just couldn't keep it together.although from the outset, there were a number of more "rough around the edges" issues with this film (namely the editing, and later some of the writing/plot development), these issues were forgivable. they became unforgivable once the movie sort of lost all momentum around the half way mark, and then the film just got tedious when you realized that it wasn't going to go anywhere at all. robbins could not breathe life into his character, but did the best he could. his female counterpart (her name escapes me now) was good in her role.the main reason for the meandering of the movie seemed to be that the film makers could not decide whether or not to do a sci-fi movie or a futuristic love story. they ended up with neither.good:some of the cinematography: grainy, it felt like "21 days later" some times.very fitting for a futuristic movie like this.i dug some of the location shots.the music was cool.the film makers vision of the future was realistic but still cool and interesting.i liked the interactions with the other minor characters in the movie.some of the writing was interesting (early on). the girl who played maria gonzales (name?? can't recall), she was good.***spoilers below***a few questions/comments:i felt that a lot of the futuristic things in this movie were convenient to fix a patchwork story. namely viruses. obviously the virus they gave her at the end of the film that made her physically 'afraid' of him was just there so that they could stick in another sex scene and then she could uncontrollably report him for code 46. then they take him away and erase his memory and the movie ends. classic 'dream sequence' cop-out ending if you ask me. ties up all the loose ends very neatly if you just make it all a dream right?was robbin's character naturally good as intuition or was it the virus?why didn't they explore the myriad of issues surrounding the girl being a clone of his mom? that could have made some interesting story.at first i like the salutations from across the globe in everyone's speech. but it became intrusive especially since their accents were not convincing. i get it, the future will undoubtedly be racially and culturally more androgynous, but it started feeling like an at&t global networking commercial by the end of it.if they were 'outside' how could they have gotten busted for code 46?'cover' was never well defined. sometimes it seemed as trivial as a visa, and other times it was as vital as life or death. again, loose definitions allow them to use it for gluing disparate parts of the plot together.okay, i'm starting to get to negative about it, so i'll stop. there were some cool scenes, and interesting things about this movie, but that only gives it a 4/10

we're in a not so distant future, globalization seems to have reached a high point, languages mixes with each other (although english prevails over the rest), races have merged, human clonation is a fact, and all the territory seems to have been divided in two zones: the one for the valid and the one for the non-valid... a brave new world (in aldous huxley's style) in which people are genetically filed and blood relationships are strictly forbidden (for health reasons that's the code 46 of the title-). in such environment two souls that are destined not to meet fall in love with each other.winterbottom had an important story, with quite a big potential. a nice recipe that he ruins giving it a so slow rhythm, narrating it in a so weary way, removing any emotions... coldness, that's all code 46 transmits. coldness and boredom. not even the presence of samantha morton and tim robbins (both of'em play their roles wonderfully) , nor the visual and sound power of some sequences can do anything to save the movie. what a pity.code 46: what could have been and never was.*my rate: 4/10

if you are a weirdo who thinks it's "romantic" and wonderful to have sex with a woman who is the genetic equivalent of your mother, get her pregnant, and then have sex with her again once she's had an abortion and not tell her that she is related to you, then you would like this movie.nevermind the fact that the guy is married and has a son at home - it makes it even more disgusting and deplorable that he has no conscience as to what he's doing. he can't do right by his job, his family, or maria. he's a loser. there is nothing romantic or positive about this movie - it is vile and incestuous.it moves slowly and it leads nowhere for over the first half of the movie. i couldn't even finish watching this pathetic excuse for a 'romance'. i'm glad we didn't waste our money in the movie theater on this one. 0/10

i just finished watching this film and think it is one of the worst films i have ever seen. it was so boring that i found myself zooming through it at x2 speed and finished it in less than 30 minutes. i was not just disappointed, but angry that i had wasted my money to rent it. it ranks within the top five of the worst films i have ever seen, and i've seen thousands of movies! the plot was very confusing. had i not first read the dvd sleeve cover, prior to renting it, i would have been totally lost throughout this film. i would not have thought that tim robbins, after having made such good films as "shawshank redemption" would have agreed to appear in this film.

the film disappointed me for many reasons: first of all the depiction of a future which seemed at first realistic to me was well-built but did only feature a marginal role. then, the story itself was a weak copy of lost in translation. the middle-eastern setting, man with family meets new girl overseas, karaoke bar, the camera movements and the imagery - all that was a very bad imitation of the excellent lost in translation which had also credibility. this movie tries to be something brilliant and cultural: it is not. i wonder why tim robbins even considered doing this film!? the female main actress is awful - did she play the precog in minority report? and why do you have to show the vagina in a movie like this? lost in translation didn't have to show excessive love scenes. r-rated just for this? this movie isn't even worth watching it from a videostore!

i was talked into seeing this by a girlfriend..john was a good guy, sweet, sensitive and looks great with no shirt on!! i thought it was a love story about both of them but it was mainly about his reactions to her letters. savannah was a likable character at the start of the movie but once she dumped him i lost respect for her. she said it tore her apart being away from him and it was hard - he was the one a million miles away, he was killing people and the only contact he got was through her letters!!! she didn't have it hard, she had family & money and he had a tour of duty!! i was so frustrated at the ending when he forgave her - he was too much of a sweetheart. i would have waited the 3 years and welcomed him home with open arms.

the only reason i rated this film as 2 is because channing tatumis beautiful however the whole film lacks emotion and was boring to watch. usually i adore a good romance but this was just a waste of time, i didn't shed a tear despite it containing sad content it just wasn't acted very well at all. i'm no film critic but i just advise girls to avoid this really unless the only reason you're watching it is to see channing tatum lol the rest of the film is rubbish and if he wasn't in it (not that his acting was any good) i would have stopped watching much quicker. it's a shame really because if the right actors were chosen for this film it could have had the potential to be a real tear jerker. .. if you're looking for a good cry or a film for a girly night in...give this one a miss!!

i was looking forward to seeing two bright young actors appearing in "dear john," but it was very slow moving; and i felt that both the screenplay and the direction hampered the flexibility of the principle performers. i usually do enjoy film adaptations of these novels. ironically, i did think the movie did an excellent job of depicting realistic military action.the cinematography was very good at segueing through love letters, focusing just enough on a key word or phrase in each letter. i felt that channing tatum became bogged down in what became a very "hang-dog" series of expressions in response to loss.

this movie had the potential to be a very good movie in my eyes, nicholas sparks is a great romance author and this movie had every chance to be just as great as the notebook but whats sets the two apart is the notebook had a dream team of leads in mcadams and gosling but here the balance is thrown miserably off by the inept acting of channing tatumi felt a lot of the scenes were uneven purely because of his performance, a lot of the emotion in various scenes is lost because he cant act, leaving an awkward and uneven situation, amanda seyfried given a great performance only to have tatum drop the ball and the mood is lost and the scene cant recover.this story deserved to be cast right, but what it got was a pretty boy who cant act. tatum should stick to what hes good at, movies that are more about his physical ability, albeit horrible, like gi joe, step up, and fighting. the less he talks the better.try not to think of me as a jaded hater of channing tatum i went in to this movie with an open mind, because i've been surprised many a time by the likes of adam sandler in reign over me. i gave the same chance to tatum i didn't view him here as the sum of his past roles, purely just by his performance in this movie, which sadly was a letdown

having read this story a while ago i was very excited to see the movie. i read the book again. it is one of my favorite nicholas sparks books. what i think what makes the story is the relationships. that was the down point for me in the movie because i think the relationships were poorly expressed in the movie. i have no idea what the point of changing main characters roles (tim's and alan's characters). the movie didn't at all capture john and savannah's relationship. maybe if you haven't read the book you might like this movie, but i thought it was so dull compared to the book. i thought channing was a great pick for john,but i had a feeling he was going to bring all young adults out to watch it, so i think it was more geared towards them. the ending cuts the whole point of the book out so i was also unhappy with that. i was hoping the movie was more like the notebook or a walk to remember and the way they captured the books. i do feel like i wasted a friday night out and 10 bucks on a sappy love story, not at all the story i was expecting to see.

before i speak my piece, i would like to make a few things clear: 1)i am a chick who's not into chick flicks ("kate&leopold" and "someone like you" are extreme exceptions- hugh jackman's ass). 2)i only picked this one up because i am a fichtner fangirl who looked forward to see him in a bathtub. 3)i am not a demi fan, though i think her performances in "immortal" and "a few good men" were sublime and have earned places in my vid library- also i think she's a little crazy (no way is she not still sleeping w/brucie).if this is a character study of an unfulfilled woman living dual lives of independence and happiness, then i'd say we have one narcoleptic melodrama. marty: literary agent. makes 6-figure salary. lives in an upscale manhattan penthouse. easy for her to read several hundred manuscripts and fall asleep at her desk for some highly suggested nocturnal escapism. or perhaps stepping through an interdiemsional portal? she has the career, the looks, a cool car, a great pad, now where are the man and kids? in steps our boy aaron- some real escapism. what are architects? they're artists who can do math, dreamers that make real money. aaron gives marty the dream of security and fills a void where she, obviously has no self confidence.on the other side of the coin, there's marie, still living out her schoolgirl fantasies while she muddles through motherhood. her children are her career and life. but what about marie, does she only exist through her children? in waltzes william, a parisian stranger who helps her focus on the one thing she has lost touch with: herself.a supposed journey of self-discovery and late a coming of age thrown in some with angst and some resentment to marty/marie's own mother. this gets a 3/10. all i could say is thank god for the bpl multimedia division, i wouldn't waste my $2.99 at blockbuster on this, put it toward a harlequin blaze title.

i went to see "passion of mind" because i usually get a kick out of the genre of alternate reality romances, i.e. "sliding doors," "me, myself, i," etc. but this was the worst one i've ever seen! i had to force myself to sit through it. i didn't even stay through the credits which is unheard of for me.the magical realism was completely missing because demi moore was grim and the lovers she was two-timing were guys who usually play villains, though each was kind of sexy and appealing.there was actually a psychological explanation provided for the dual lives, with a distasteful frisson of the elektra complex; maybe the magic shouldn't be explained for this genre to work.(originally written 5/28/2000)

i had the misfortune to catch this on a flight recently. i had the bigger misfortune of having it played on my return flight as well. obviously demi's attempt to get some "arty" cred, the movie is a shambles because of her lousy acting ability. a better actress might have made this work, but a simple look at the face of moore shows the emptiness within. at least she's not ruining american literature this time out.

this movie defines the word "confused". all the actors stay true to the script. more's the pity, because the acting is fine, but the script is a confused pastiche of pseudo-psycho-analytic random ideas. the pacing is mind-numbingly slow, and the soft-focus-lens cinematography gets on the nerves quickly. i give it 4 out of 10.

enough talent and sincerity went into making this film that i wish it turned out better. everyone is clearly doing their best to be true to an intriguing premise, but it's too deep a vision, too involved attempt at disentangling mental delusion to survive a transition to the screen. it is an attempt to capture the dimensionality of gossamer patterns on celluloid -- the result is muddled and slow. i give it a 10 for effort, but a 5 overall.

this movie started with some promise: big name cast, good looking sets, but then it fell apart.most of the time it can't tell whether it's a serious movie or a comedy. one minute they're talking about how there's no joy in killing and the next there is a fight scene set to funny music and funny banter.some of the acting is pretty bad, mainly from patrick swayze and piper perabo. she also gets some groaner lines like, "when i marry, it will be about love." ugh.but the worst thing about this movie is that it's just boring. not enough action, not enough humor, not enough plot, not much of anything really. just a lot of clichés and cheesy moments.also, a movie with "dragon" in the title should contain a lot more dragons than the few (and pathetic cgi dragons) that appeared in this movie.can't the scifi channel show *any* good movies?

i am a german student so sorry for eventually mistakes (i'm working on it ;) )the stylistic very interesting converted and with effective sound effects accentuated platitudinous action of the drama deflect in no way from the horrible bad actors (insincere and unnatural moves and expressions of feelings) and makes so the relatively weird and senseless story less better. just the typical slasher-genre with in this case very odd action. many by-plays destroy partly the main story and let the viewers up to the end into the dark, create weirdness and let surmise the senses of actions and the point mere hazily. for sure its an hit for slasher-fans but not for me. but although the interesting style of cinematography and adeptly use of light is turned out well.so not the best one...

think of this film as fan service, a wet dream for the slasher genre admirer. we start off with a gory prologue which is pretty much unrelated to the rest of the film. flash forward nine months and the real meat of the plot begins: the virginal mandy lane is coveted by every jock and nerd in her school, and gets invited to spend a weekend at a ranch by three guys who think they can get lucky, and two bimbos obsessed with their weight and boob size. so.. you have a bunch of young students in a house in the middle of nowhere on a dark night, who want to do nothing but have sex, do drugs and drink booze. the only other company is a hunky ranch-hand who may or may not be suffering from gulf war syndrome. hmm... potential future suspect maybe?so as you're probably ascertained by now, all the house-guests end up being slaughtered in a variety of bloody ways, and for a change the black man isn't the first to die. there are some conventions that still hold up though, like the scantily clad babe being chased by a car in a field. or the lights going out mysteriously in the evening as our 'heroes' unwisely separate to tackle the problem. even down to the so-called shocking twist at the end, the movie is like an old 80's horror updated for the noughties, and on this score it succeeds.unfortunately, it also inherits a lot of the problems of the films of that era too, namely the paper-thin characters and the predictability of the whole enterprise. people get cut up, shot, bludgeoned etc but because of their innate hatefulness to the audience and stupidity in getting themselves in these situations, it's hard to care as the bodies stack up. someone gets murdered, one of their friends goes out to look for them alone, bang they're brown bread. rinse, then repeat. maybe one day we'll get a screenplay with plausible, intelligent, likable characters who make rational decisions but still end up being outwitted by a genius killer. until then, we have to tolerate teenagers with the i.q of pond-life being picked off by a deranged hoodie. oh well.. 4/10

looking at these reviews and seeing all these high ratings leave me to believe that large amounts of red corn syrup will please just about any brain dead idiot. this movie is beyond useless. all the cliché's of a slasher film without any substance. i am sure i could go in to details about the movie but why bother when you can sum it up? obviously everyone wants mandy lane and she apparently wants none of the guys. throughout the movie you will see this.when she stops being friends to the typical boy trapped in friend-zone loser, he goes ballistic and when she goes on a road trip to the middle of no where (of course) he begins to hunt them one by one. sounds decent so far right? but what made this movie suck beyond belief is when you find out that not only is her loser friend the killer but she is as well.. the plan was beyond ridiculous. lets together kill all our friends and then kill each other. they give no reason why they wanted to do this and given mandy lane's "goody too shoes" demeanor it makes you scratch your head even more as to what is actually motivating these characters to do anything they are doing. it's sad.. this movie had lots of potential but the director or writer apparently can't relate to the audience in anyway.

i started watching this because i was looking for a nice 'background' comedy for my sunday morning. then i noticed that this was going to be a road-movie and i decided to actually watch this.first 15 minutes were awful, but i wanted to give this a chance, because i never judge a movie without watching it throughly. then things started to get little better. this seemed like a nice road-movie about friendship.. but then the movie started to get horrible predictable cliché-twists and when the movie was over it left you feeling like you had wasted your time. did this have anything to say? why did they even make a movie like this? and i wasn't expecting a modern citizen kane, but still, i have several ideas how this movie could have been improved.so take my piece of advice; leave this alone and go watch a real road-movie. there are many of those. i won't make the directors of those movies seem bad by putting their names on this review.1/10

this movie was an all around uninspiring film. it was a non-moving story that definitely does not get you thinking anything other then where is all the strong moving material the other critics say about the film the 3 main actors are good, and there is a few laughs but once again it becomes another movie that you keep watching in hopes of it getting better and it just doesn't. i watched this movie last night and wished that we hadn't wasted our precious time (while baby is sleeping) watching this film. i plan not to recommend this to my family and friends, as well as obviously anyone looking to rent it. i was pretty much non-impressed with everything about this film.

unforgiven is clint eastwoods last tribute to the once great west. but whilst i thought this was going to be good and raise the bar for future westerns to come i was sadly mistaken. unforgiven, though simple in plot it falls flat on characters and emotions and i would certainly say that unforgiven is eastwoods worst film to date. eastwoods himself seems too old to play the part of acting and directing which also adds a downfall to the overall look of the film.all the characters seem rushed and ragged around the edges especially eastwoods character. the acting doesn't seem to flow and contribute to what the characters are feeling. the direction is poorly misled by quirky shots. so overall unforgiven is not eastwoods best and by far one of the worst westerns around.

and now for another point of view: i didn't like it. i didn't finish it in fact. i know that "unforgiven" is ranked by some as one of the greatest westerns ever made. i know that it stars and was directed by clint eastwood, one of the icons of american cinema. i know that it won a bunch of oscars. still, i didn't like it. i don't like westerns, and that's clearly a matter of taste, but i also don't admire eastwood's acting. he is not and never has been a leading man. he is no burt lancaster, no paul newman, no john wayne. in this film alone he is dwarfed by richard harris and gene hackman; they are both actors. no, eastwood is a tall guy with a reedy voice who usually plays tough guys. here he plays a retired tough guy. when i see him on screen, i see a man laboring at his acting. then there's the anti-western western plot. it is too obviously intended to inject contemporary values -- a respect for the role of women, blacks, native americans, and single parents; a disrespect for violence and drinking; the wholesomeness that comes with marriage, including interracial marriage, and small adorable children -- into a century in which those values weren't necessarily accepted, at least in these ways. by promoting those values, the movie comes across as mannered, if not preachy. then there are the hoary movie stereotypes -- prostitutes with hearts of gold, the kid who can't shoot straight, the city slicker new to the wild west, the sage brush shimmering on a summer afternoon with a musical accompaniment in major chords. finally there is the pacing of eastwood's direction. i gave up after an hour. eastwood was still riding north, chatting with morgan freeman and the kid who couldn't shoot straight, sixty minutes after the plot driven by the slashing of a prostitute was set in motion. it was way too slow. somebody had to find these elements uncompelling. i am afraid it was me.

starring: james belushi; peter dinklage; alex neuberger and jason lee underdog is a true hero's tale. here is the story of shoeshine, a regular, playful little beagle. when he is dog napped by a megalomaniac midget hell-bent on destruction, something freaky happens.our quirky little neighborhood pooch gains extraordinary powers. he can run as fast a cheetah; fly as fast a superhero and has the power of thunder. he is no longer shoeshine; he is underdog  the best crime-fighter in the animal kingdom. the city cannot sleep until underdog rids it of the evil midget dr. simon barsinister and his cronies.if you fancy some really light-hearted entertainment with all the clichés of superhero action flicks, then this one is for you. as for quality entertainment, this one is strictly for the juniors. those of you hoping to enjoy the comedy of the fast-fading star -james belushi - a word of caution: this is not one of his finer works.

jason lee does well to give this doggy movie fleeting promise, but it's not enough to distinguish it from any other bland family comedythis live-action, cg-enhanced adventure sees a shamed police dog (jason lee) transformed into a super-dog via an accident in the lab of scheming scientist dr. simon barsinister (peter dinklage). underdog sets about saving the city while attempting to keep his identity secret - a challenge given that he can both talk and fly.the odd gag raises a smile, but underdog's human sidekicks (james belushi and alex neuberger as father and son) are as dull as the predictable storyline. one for kids too young to have seen superman. or spider-man. or even shaggy dog

i didn't like underdog!i mean it was really unnecessary and needed a big face lift and then it would have been maybe passable but for the main part i didn't like it.this wasn't like any other kid movie its one of those movies that wanted parents(who grew up watching the cartoon)to come with there kids to come see this,i am neither of them so the film didn't appeal to me in the slightest.i had some problems with it like i don't think jason lee was the right voice for underdog it made it him sound sloppy and really unintelligent.then it was really predictable which makes you feel tired and mad.the humor was really what made me mad it was just to unfunny and somewhat pathetic.the one thing that bothered me the most thought was how almost everything out of underdog's mouth was sarcastic or rude.the acting was passable but needed a little improvement.if you have kids they might enjoy it, but if your not a kid by all means see it you might like it unlike me. 3.4 stars out of 10

story of the creation of underdog and adventures battling simon bar sinister in a live action format. first we have showshine picked up off the street and brought to a science experiment lab where simon bar sinister works. he fights back when sinister tries to inject him with a chemical and accident occurs, he gets superpowers and the lab blows up wounding sinister. on the street shoeshine runs afoul of riff raff, another dog and gets picked up by jim belushi who was a guard at the lab. belushi's son discovers that shoeshine has all these powers and eventually shoeshine becomes underdog, who will once again battle sinister.once you decided that under dog was going to be a real dog you've sort of limited yourself as to whether the film was going to work or not. for me the film half works and half doesn't. the part that doesn't is all of the stuff where you see shoeshine, the dog, as a dog with his master. some of the repartee is funny, but it just drags on and on as we get introduced to sweet polly and her mistress and we go through all the typical lets see what you can do stuff. its a deadly 20 or 25 minutes and effectively kills the film. its painfully dull and feels like it takes forever to get through it, which considering the film is say 75 minutes sans credits, is something you don't want to do.the parts that are good are anything with simon bar sinister (peter dinklage is a blast) and anything where underdog goes into action. some how somewhere they managed to find a way to be both twistedly true to the spirit of the cartoon and to update it. of course i could be wrong since the middle section is so dull, but i think not, since i do look forward to catching the end of this again on cable.as a whole its probably as awful as some people have said, but if you can wait for cable where you can stumble on the good parts, this is an okay cartoon to film adaption. (but wait for cable-really)

ok - i gave it a "3" just because they obviously had no money to make this film, but i feel it might deserve the "2.3" rating it had when i got here. i'm actually helping to raise it's rating, despite being bored for the last hour and a half. i will save the "1's" and the "2's" for the higher budget pieces of crap. at least the makers of "rise of the undead" didn't waste that much money. they did manage to waste 90 minutes of my life.the movie is too claustrophobic for me. the entire movie takes place in the same building, in dark rooms and hallways. with a setting like this, there should have been more action or character development, but there is just a lot of meaningless talk. i didn't get to know any of the characters. there is a schoolgirl and a goth chick but we never find out much more about them. none of the characters seem really likable.terrible movie made on zero budget. no scary special effects. no suspense. really nothing interesting at all here, folks. i admit i downloaded this from the net. it was free but i am throwing it away.sorry to the filmmakers. better luck next time. this one is more like a soap opera than a zombie movie.

zombie movies are hot, i love 'em. can't get enough. why i would purchase a film of this caliber goes without explanation, i just really love zombies. surprise, this really isn't much of a zombie movie; low-budget i can handle, being duped just irritates me.a group of horror-film clichés hold up in a warehouse/lab/who-knows-what to escape a fire storm outside. panic, yelling, low-light, and (eventually) zombies ensue.i kind of feel bad for the film makers, as it is obvious that they really thought they were putting together something good; a serious, scary horror film. it isn't, far from it, it's a boring mess of wooden acting, cheesy fx, poor lighting, excessive dialogue, and over editing.things first go awry when it takes a good 10+ minutes for the characters to ever sit down and start to figure out what is going on. it gets worse when another 20 minutes go by and they are still sitting around trying to figure out what is going on. all of this is littered with non-acting and bad dialogue.finally some one gets attached (not by a zombie though) and hope flickers just a touch before the characters are again lounging around whining (the only emotion any one every generates) about how much this sucks. me too guys, me too.finally zombies are in the mix, but no one watching cares any more. i think there was some blood and gore tossed in, but i was too busy praying for the credits to roll to notice. and when the screen finally did fade to black i felt even more cheated by the pointlessly 'cube' inspired ending.i will give credit for trying very hard, even if it failed miserably. that and the punk chick was very hot if totally under used.can't really recommend this to anyone, save for film students looking for 'no-no' pointers.4/10

i'm not sure what the appeal of this movie is, but i couldn't find it. it's a really long, barely credible, hardly lucid conversation between three guys on one set. it doesn't move anywhere, the characters are just totally bizarre, the underlying plot equally so. it's lost on me, definitely a walk out movie.the one thing that keeps you from walking out is the ever unrealized possibility that it might have some kind of point or meaningful climax, and the fact that, all irritation aside at the banal personalities, they're acted quite reasonably. but you have to brace yourself for endless dialog, wishing on many an occasion that teach would just shut the %*&* up for a moment.

this movie was beyond disappointment. well acted story that means nothing. the plot is ridiculous and even what story there is goes absolutely nowhere. it truly isn't worth a nickel, buffalo or otherwise..pun intended!

this movie was terrible. it was so very terrible.most annoying was the way the trial was conducted. the defense attorney is allowed to ramble on and on when questioning a witness without the prosecution making any objections. he attacks the children brought to give testimony with cruel ferociousness and repeatedly yells at them that they're lying. these just aren't things that they subject children who have been sexually abused to. the trial is silly and it ruins the whole movie...(law & order has spoiled me for courtroom accuracy-ness).

this movie was total cheese. it stank. the only thing good about it was the acting. other then that, nothing noteworthy at all.big time spoilers coming up! don't read anymore if you have not seen it!this movie is centered around a family whose happy and wonderful lives have been shattered as a result of their younger son and later as they find out older son have been molested by their daycare providers. although, they are called liars in court and the defense attorney is a real prick the jury finds them guilty and convicts them.in the end all i can say to the director is: "the next time you wanna make a movie like this, do it differently".

ugh. yes, it's exactly like the mcmartin mess, or the horrific arrests in wenatchee, washington. in the movie, the mother keeps aggressively questioning her little boy, over and over and over, until he finally tells her what she obviously wants to hear. the court investigators and "therapists" repeat the pattern. the questioning itself is sexually creepy, a relentlessy repeated assault in its own way.the moviemakers throw in a doctor talking about physical evidence of abuse, maybe to justify the film's point of view: that two- to four-year-olds never make "things like this" up. well, they will if every adult they know is asking them to. the way this piece endorses such discredited interrogation techniques makes watching it an exercise in frustration for anyone who knows what it takes to get a successful prosecution in real life. (they also add a special arrest incident towards the end to "prove" their case -- no parallel to this fictional incident ever occurred in real life. can't say more here without turning this into a spoiler, but you'll know it when you see it.)yes, children are abused, sometimes by paid care providers. but to watch a movie which affirms the ludicrous, hysterical accusations against so many totally innocent people, to watch re-creations of the trials that ruined the lives of countless children as well as the lives of the accused -- i didn't think i'd last until the end. it's just too sad, and made more so by the writing team's seeming endorsement of the abusive, paranoid, obsessional questioning techniques that started -- what can we call it? the bonfire of the sanities? no one i know has ever been accused of child abuse, thank heaven, but my 12-times-over-great grandmother was accused of witchcraft and killed for it. mobs filled with what they think is holy anger are just as dangerous now as three hundred years ago. sensational drivel like this -- "these accusations of satanic abuse are cropping up all over the country, there must be something there!" "so tell the jury that!" -- just eggs them on. and whoever thought it was a good idea to have kids under ten, some of them under five, play these roles? it's traumatic to watch them delivering their lines; how much more traumatic was it to act these parts? the moviemakers' commitment to fight child abuse apparently doesn't apply to themselves. and what were the child-actors' parents thinking? "melinda" (uncredited, at least in the version on the a&e network in 2005, but i think it was cassy friel) and "teddy" (brian bonsall) were terrific. professionals or not, though, they were too young to be exposed to this material, much less to be paid to act it out. despite ruthlessly exploiting these real-life children, "do you know the muffin man" got an emmy nomination for directing -- which just goes to show how crazed things were, back in 1989.

after watch this movie i was surprised that someone had like it!!!! i think this is the worst comedy i ever seen....ever!!!! if you think you had already seen the worst comedy made wait for watch this crap!!!! not funny at all( ok one or two laugh maybe.......but you have to be really high), the acting is terrible and the story doesn't exist. even if you like snowboarding ( and i really do) you will hate this movie. ok, ok you can see some nice babes , some nice snowboarding tricks and some beautiful mountains but that's all!!! watch a porno set in the mountains instead because the acting and the story line might be better!!!!! sometimes in imdb i read bad review about some movie and at the end they are not so awful....but this one, believe me,is pure trash!!!! don't waste your time and money in this one.

i guess if you like snow boarding you may get some enjoyment from watching some nice scenery and some nice tricks. but that is all the film has to offer. the story line is non-existent, and any jokes that may have been in the film were not funny, even on a sympathy level. i also disliked the characters, the main actor (adam grimes)tried his best, and for a comedy like this that doesn't have to be much, but when surrounded by so many other bad actors he had no hope of making this film good. but i shouldn't be too harsh on them, for all i know they might have great skill, but with a script that i could have written in ten minutes, what ever skills they had were ran and hid for fear of appearing in this film. my advise is don't watch it, i wish i never did!

on this quagmire of mediocrity? you are so much better than this.simply put, frostbite is worthless. bad acting (and i use that term loosely), minimalist "plot," sophomoric humor, and lackluster snowboarding. there's not even a sufficient display of feminine pulchritude to spark the prurient interest of socially inept, but red-blooded, males.top gun had spectacular flight sequences to goggle at. days of thunder had heart-pounding racing action. even point break had skydiving scenes to its credit. frostbite has none of these. it's not worth your time, my time, traci lords' time, carmen nicole's time, nor the time of anyone involved with this destruction of celluloid that would have been perfectly usable on something worthwhile had it not been wasted on this fodder for the recycling center.the world will be a better place when we forget that frostbite ever existed.

this movie is by far one of the worst b-movies i have ever seen. there are no plot twists at all. though the acting is decent, the storyline is terrible. there are also many mistakes in the movie, and it was bothersome to watch. for any of you who like horror movies, slasher movies, or even b-movies, i don't recommend this to anyone at all. most of the movie is focused on pointless killing, in ways that aren't even worth discussing. this movie could very well be compared to a crappy remake of jeepers creepers, which, too, wasn't that great of a movie. for anyone who wishes to spend a day at home, watching poorly made movies, this one takes the cake.

the acting was very sub-par, you had costas mandalar acting like triple h's dumber forest ranger brother, a scott mcmahon look-alike as his depute who i guess your supposed to care about but there is no emotional involvement anywhere. you have the stupid lesbian, not that i have any thing against lesbians, i don't just stupid ones who keep running around in a punisher like shirt and a grunge like hat who keeps asking if anyone saw her dead lover.the villain could be scary and there is a morality tale somewhere about trying to fight age and death but it is lost in this movie. costas hurst helmsley points out to the soon to be victims the way back into town, while obviously there are city lights behind him.also a mispronunciation of ed gein but pronounced it gine. as a citizen of wisconsin. we have had our share of monsters gein,dahmer, and mccarthy, but if your going to use it pronounce it right.god why do i watch all these terrible films. oh yes i am a glutton for punishment and i watch these so you don't have to.

dr. chopper starts shortly after teenager nicholas' (robert adamson) mum has died, he is still cut up about it but every cloud has a silver lining & in this case it appears that his mum owns a log cabin at lake tatonka the self proclaimed 'friendly place for happy people' that she didn't tell him about. so nicholas together with his girlfriend jessica (chelsey crisp) & three friends, jimmy (butch hansen), reese (chase hoyt) & tamara (ashley mccarthy) head out there for a fun weekend. unfortunately things don't go according to plan, the cabin turns out to be little more than a run down shed & their neighbours turn out to be dr. chopper (ed brigadier) & his two nurses who go around killing anyone they meet to use them in horrible experiments...going straight-to-video/dvd dr. chopper was edited & directed by lewis schoenburn & this film seems to be having a hard time here on the imdb with some pretty harsh reviews, while i think dr. chopper as a horror film is pretty worthless i don't think some of the criticism i've read is entirely justified. the script which takes itself very seriously is credited to ian holt (whether he likes it or not...) who has a role in the film as detective crocker according to the imdb cast list although i can't remember any character of that name, maybe he was one of the cops at the start? anyway, the basic story is alright i suppose although it's a tad dull & lasts for too long, it's typical slasher fare with some sort of evil character running around bumping off our annoying american teen cast, you know the drill by now. besides some brief & undeveloped nonsense about dr. chopper using body parts to replenish his own deteriorating body there's not much story here & the script seems to exist solely to invent situations for girls to take their tops off, there's the inevitable sex scenes, there's a sequence where some girls have to complete a sorority house initiation topless & there's even a couple of lesbians here as well one of whom is seen without her full compliment of clothing. oh, & when i say topless i mean they aren't wearing any tops but they all keep their bras on so you may want to bear in mind there isn't any actual full frontal nudity in dr. chopper at all. so there you have it really, it's an average story that has a mildly surprising twist at the end which is wasted, is populated with poor clichéd dumb character's that exist only to showcase some cheap gore scenes & girls in bras. to be honest i expect a little bit more from my films but then again maybe i'm just being picky.director schoenburn does ok actually, this is by no means the worst looking film i've seen although it still looks cheap. there's no style here, i didn't think it was scary & there's no atmosphere either. the gore is restrained & restricted to some dead bodies & severed limbs, there's nothing new here or any particularly convincing special effects. dr. chopper is also one of those films where character decisions & motivations are ridiculous.technically this is a little rough around the edges but is reasonably well made on what was probably a really low budget, the forest locations are suitably isolated although the cops office looks like someones front room & the two nurses outfits at the start look like stripper outfits. the acting is alright, it could have better but i've certainly seen worse.dr. chopper indeed features a doctor who rides around on a chopper motorbike but unfortunately that just isn't enough to satisfy me, despite it being a reasonably competent production the lack of any real gore, nudity or a decent plot sinks it without trace.

as a helpful warning for others, i believe "skeleton man" is actually worse than "raptor island." i have been using ri as an example of the worst original movie presented on the sci-fi channel, but sm is the most laughably incoherent and wretchedly designed movie i have yet seen. yes, i did watch almost the whole thing, coming into it about 35 minutes into it. it drew me in with its pure ineptitude. what was sci-fi thinking? once skeleton man and the surviving platoon leader (or whatever he was--i'm not good on military unit terminology) reached the chemical plant, the movie moved into a zone of impossible nonsense that was almost mesmerizing. i had the same idea as another viewer who wondered if more than one movie had someone been edited together to make one terrible whole.

i have very few to add to what all the other reviewers already made more than clear! this movie is awful! beyond awful... in fact, so insufferable that they have yet to come up with a term to describe the awfulness that is "skeleton man". in case you expect your movies to feature a minimum of logic and plot, you should stay as far away from this as humanly possible. sure, loads of people are getting killed by this skeleton-puppet wearing a ridiculous cape, but nobody ever bothers to properly explain what he is, where he comes from or why he's so angry with the world. he looks like a crossover between skeletor from "masters of the universe" and the horseman from "sleepy hollow" and runs amok in some godforsaken wilderness. the setting of "skeleton man" is another totally retarded aspect! for nearly half an hour, i assumed that the movie took place at a small isolated island, but it simply plays at the mainland where fancy highways cross the forest and power plants are located at the end of the woods! huh? why does everybody pretend to be trapped when there are like a million escape routes? anyway, after a couple of totally random killings, a special commando squad, led by poor washed-up michael rooker, arrives to come and hunt a monster they don't know anything about. really hilarious is how every member of this squad introduces him/herself as the expert in a certain field (we have a sniper-specialist, a tracking genius, a drill instructor...), yet they all die before any of them is able to demonstrate their supposedly masterful skills! the horror gods must really hate casper van dien, as he's present again as well, portraying an heroic soldier who steals a truck for no apparent reason, crashes on the highway, but somehow gets catapulted back to the middle of the woods to die there. right, that makes sense... furthermore the characters steal cool one-liners from "predator", the bonehead's horse constantly changes colors, helicopters are brought down with bow& arrows, ordinary bullets cause trees to explode and completely pointless vietnam flashbacks haunt michael rooker. i say we all combine forces and vote this pathetic flick into the imdb bottom top 100 asap!

the scientist charles and his wife (or assistant) marissa receive some objects and a skull from an ancient indian cemetery, and while cleaning a vase, they are attacked and murdered by a mysterious being, the skeleton man. then, a military squad commanded by captain leary (michael rooker) seeks out two groups of four soldiers each that vanished in the jungle. they face the skeleton man, shooting him while he kills each soldier. then the skeleton man goes to a power plant, and captain leary explodes the facility destroying the supernatural being.i bought "skeleton man" on dvd expecting to see a funny trash, but i found an awfully boring, annoying and senseless crap, with shoots and explosions. the imbecile story is totally disconnected and does not make any sense, and the military team is composed of imbeciles, insisting in shooting the supernatural skeleton man until they are totally slaughtered. their leader is also the most stupid, with the blow-up of an entire facility in the end to destroy the supernatural rip-off of the extraterrestrial warrior predator. on dvd, it is possible to use the fast forward button along the movie and reduce the suffering of the viewer. my vote is two.title (brazil): "skeleton man"

as i write this, no user reviews are in yet, but there are 17 votes with a 4.8 average, so apparently some people thought this movie had its moments. i didn't notice any, and even if i had i don't think i could have stopped rolling my eyes for long enough to appreciate them.a common debate among movie buffs is whether major mistakes in science, police tactics, and the like so common in b movies should detract significantly from one's enjoyment. i tend to fall into the "yes, that's a reasonable reaction" camp -- especially when the mistakes are central to the plot. with this movie, i look forward to reading how anyone can defend this mess. they completely botch pretty much every aspect of military tactics and strategy, police tactics, weapons, science, folklore, common sense, and human behavior (outside of b movies, that is.) in short, i can't think of any non-trivial thing they got right.any movie would have its work cut out for it when its central premise is a supernatural spirit, impervious to all small arms, able to disappear into another dimension at will, and yet apparently vulnerable to simply a bigger explosion. (they don't make ghosts like they used to.) combine this premise with every detail being wrong and you have a memorably bad movie.

this ranks up there as the worst movies of all time. no research or thought at all went into this movie. action scenes were thrown in at random intervals which made no sense in the context of the movie. items appeared and disappeared at random, etc. it's obvious that this was directed by a "stunt coordinator", who should go back to his old job. the skeleton man rode a horse throughout the movie, which amazingly, could change color at will. either that, or someone thought the audience would all be colorblind and not notice. blood would be on the actors in 1 scene and the very next, miraculously disappear and then reappear. seems that everyone connected with this movie forgot to check for inconsistencies.

although casper van dien and michael rooker are generally relegated to b movies, even they are above this movie. it fails to convey even the slightest sense of excitement, fear, or dread -- unless you count the dread of sitting through the rest of this garbage. the direction is amateurish with annoying cuts and jerky movement that hides the fact that the killer is no where near the victims when he attacks. and what a killer he is: a cheap skull mask and a black hood. i liked him better when he was fighting he-man. this is one of the laziest jobs of character design i've ever seen. i mean, it's skeletor! and he's on a horse! this is supposed to be some scary, supernatural creature? how are we supposed to take this seriously? all we get is scenes of this dude riding around the woods on his horse -- which he can barely stay on -- interspersed with scenes of soldiers shooting randomly into the woods, thinking they can shoot a ghost. occasionally, skeletor will shoot someone with an arrow or ride by and stab someone, revealing how corny the effects really are. i generally enjoy sci fi channel fare on a basic cheese level, but this film is too inept for any level of enjoyment. where's dolph lundgren when you need him???

if you like to get a couple of fleeting glimpses of cleavage on some attractive women, there may be a second or two of enjoyment from this film. if you enjoy seeing poorly conceived and executed "action" scenes, there are plenty. if you are both blind and deaf, i still advise you to not have this film on in your presence. it is surely the worst or very close to the worst film i have ever seen. and it does appear that there was some money spent on it. talk about throwing money away! as an editor, i would hope that the "editor(s?)" of this "movie" never again be allowed to edit a film, book, or even a post-it note. as a writer, i would hope that the author(s?) never again be allowed near even a broken crayon. you would think that i am not recommending that you view this movie. not so. tape it (so you may stop your pain when you need to) and educate yourself as to how bad a movie can be.

my wife and i enjoy bad science fiction movies. some movies are so bad they are good. mansquito was one of those. that one was bad but it had some redeeming qualities. it makes you wonder how a self respecting actor approaches lines like "hey! mansquito!"this one is so bad it has now taken its place as our standard for bad. it isn't just a bad movie, it really stinks. there was the coed strike force, the "indian" that rode around in a black cloak and used a sword for crying out loud. he shot down a helicopter with an arrow!! we tried to laugh at this movie but there were no points at which it didn't rise above pitiful. we couldn't come up with any redeeming features except for one. those were the words "the end"there seemed to be no plot, no character development, and no point to the movie. someone in hollywood needs to be fired.

to be honest, the movie was so horrible that i loved it. never in my life have a seen such a terrible movie. i was in shock. i mean, i don't even know what to say.the characters couldn't even keep their own guns, one minute a guy had an m16 and his friend had an mp5, then in the next scene they switched guns. (don't ask, trust me i know my guns)and i will never understand how they got from a place that looked like vietnam, to an arizona highway, to my backyard, and then to a chemical plant in california, that is what i took from it.why would you be afraid of a guy in a halloween mask wearing a trash bag for a cape and shot plastic arrows at you? how is that frightening? i wanted to swallow arsenic halfway through the movie. i love how the "skeleton man" randomly decided to go on a killing spree at that particular day. but hey, whoever made this movie should be shot in the knees and fed to a mound of fire ants.good day.

thank god for dvr and the high speed of it's fast forward. even with that i couldn't sit through any more of that travesty. when they came across the old indian asking for beans i gave up and erased it. is this the best that scifi channel can come up with for saturday nights? how about some old classics instead? the idea of a coed special forces unit was bad enough. it seems like they wanted to save money by having everything filmed out in the woods. what more can i say? it was so awful that i don't think i can come up with enough lines to qualify for space to review it. but, it looks like one more line will do it. save your time, let alone your money on this dog of a film.

ok i have seen hershall gordon lewis movies before but this one really takes the cake,its really gory and gross,not to mention disgusting the way the strippers are done in,i'm talking bad acting that makes plan 9 from outer space look like hamlet,the only saving grace is the late great henny youngman as the strip club owner,yeah take my wife..., please.the stripteasers are real sexy for 1972,i believe they used this same plot again in the roger corman movie;stripped to kill in 1987.i did enjoy the earlier h.g.lewis flick 100 maniacs,which was a mini masterpiece of sorts,but bad acting,no awards here,but be aware this is a splatter movie that paved the way for friday the 13th,and saw.in one disturbing scene a half naked stripper has her butt spanked with a meat tenderizer.ugh!morbid stuff here.h.g. lewis strikes again. 2 out of 10.

this movie is not a remake of she's all that ( 1999)?where is the renewal of the american movie? this was probably the worst movie i saw in the last 5 years. this and the last movies of schwarzenegger.

of course, all this nonsense begs the question 'does a genre as self-referential as the teen comedy really need another parody movie?' the woeful 'scary movie' (i and ii) took the formula about as far as it could go - 'not another teen movie' really doesn't have anything either intelligent or shockingly excessive to add.the plot, essentially based on fairyfloss teenflic 'she's all that', walks a shaky line between parody and homage ('john hughes high school'). everything from 'american beauty' to 'varsity blues' is mined for references. the result is ultimately an unfulfilling viewer experience. the downside of giving us a carbon copy plot of 'she's all that' is that we all know where its going anyway. and if we didn't then the jokes would be meaningless.there's extremely little to recommend here. the token gross-out scene (an erupting toilet) seems badly out of place here amongst all the 'feel-good' references. there are moments of humour - the song is funny enough and the odd good line is send the audiences way. it stinks, don't watch it.

"red sonja" is flawed, weak and lacking. even the camp-ness isn't good.there are only two good things about "red sonja"; the costumes (even though the red sonja costume is ridiculous. it's ironic that a girl who is even afraid to be touched by men, because she was raped, still choose to wear so few little clothes, even when it rains.) and the music by ennio morricone. still the movie is somewhat watchable but certainly not recommendable.the story is extremely simple and they didn't even bother to make it interesting. the story could have been forgotten if there had been some good action sequences and some humor, both are present but are seriously flawed in many ways. the movie takes itself too serious and tries to impress but fails completely.brigitte nielsen is an horrible leading lady. i don't know who's accent is worse; hers or arnie's and on top of that; she can't act. there is also absolutely no chemistry between the two characters which makes the love story totally unbelievable. even worse was sandahl bergman as the main villain who acts more poorly than a paper bag. ronald lacey was somewhat good in his role, but my god he looked horrible, he changed so much since his (only well known) role in "raiders of the lost ark". maybe it had something to do with his illness which claimed his life in 1991? and by the way, what was with all those "raiders of the lost ark" actors in this movie? next to ronald lacey, pat roach, terry richards and tutte lemkow appeared in a role, it seemed like some kind of "raiders of the lost ark" reunion.the only times when the movie gets a bit interesting is during the (sword)fights even though some of them are needless and weak.only really watchable for the fans of the fantasy-genre.4/10

red sonja is a career-step-in-the-wrong-direction for arnold schwarzenegger. having made a couple of sword 'n' sorcery films (as conan) he had moved onto slightly more serious acting roles in films like the terminator and commando, only to make a mystifying return to the sword 'n' sorcery genre for this 1985 debacle. it's hard to figure out why he bothered, as this is weaker than both conan films in every conceivable department. allegedly, this was to have been the third conan film, but for one reason or another the emphasis was shifted onto the leading female character, the titular red-head, leaving poor old arnold to play an incredibly dull supporting role. spare a thought, too, for director richard fleischer who had given the world classics like 20,000 leagues under the sea, fantastic voyage, the boston strangler and 10 rillington place. in this - his penultimate film - fleischer also has taken a gigantic career step backwards.evil queen gedren (sandahl bergman) wants to rule the world, and she needs a priceless and powerful talisman to do so. she and her brutish army storm a keep populated by priestesses and steal the said talisman, massacring the helpless priestesses as they go. one of the dead priestesses has a sister named sonja (brigitte nielsen), a fiery red-headed warrior, who upon hearing of her sister's death swears revenge upon the evil gedren. sonja rides across the land in search of gedren's lair. along the way she picks up travelling companions in the shape of a boy prince, tarn (ernie reyes jr) and his bodyguard falkon (paul smith). she also meets the muscular warrior conan - sorry, i mean kalidor (!) - who offers to join her in her quest. initially sonja doesn't want the help of kalidor (arnold schwarzenegger), preferring instead to prove that she can confront and defeat her enemies alone, but eventually she warms to him and accepts his assistance.red sonja is a staggeringly poor film, all the more so when one muses that it was made in 1985 when the sword 'n' sorcery genre was close to its end. it seems so simplistic and amateurish that one could easily mistake it for an early example of its kind. the performances are poor on the whole, ranging from bergman's embarrassingly ott villain to reyes' unbelievably irritating spoilt brat to schwarzenegger's wooden and unenthusiastic hero. nielsen is slightly better as the heroine - presumably full of enthusiasm at the thought of being in her first starring role - but she is let down very badly by the stupidity of clive exton and george macdonald fraser's script. the film is riddled with goofs, including a scene where schwarzenegger is seen in close-up hacking down bad guys but in a long-shot in the same sequence there isn't a corpse in sight. technically it is very inept too, with sub-standard special effects and appallingly mechanical monsters. there are a few compensations, such as ennio morricone's enjoyable music (morricone spent a great deal of the '80s providing good music for awful films, e.g the island, treasure of the four crowns and hundra). another compensation is giuseppe rotunno's lensing of the locations - in fact, much of the time it's a hell of a lot more gratifying to look at the lovely scenery than the actors standing in the foreground! there were very few sword 'n' sorcery films after red sonja, so in some ways it might go down in history as the film which destroyed its own genre.

it is sad that schwarzenegger was the best thing about this production, especially considering the fact that he had not yet come into his own, and was still as stiff as cardboard in his dialog delivery.actually, this isn't as bad as some critics say, but it isn't good, either. it is amusing, and does play like a poor country cousin of the conan line, making it a conflicted, uneven, poor work. and speaking of poor, the quality is terrible, due to the era in which this was filmed, but that is not the only reason.the story herein is inferior, even to the conan line, but moreover, it loses itself in the "red sonja must be dominated by big strong schwarzenegger" ploy, and entirely forgets its purpose, if it ever had one.it's entertaining, but in a low-budget, guilty-pleasure "b" kind of way.it rates a 4.2/10 from...the fiend :.

sometimes intentionally campy, at other times unintentionally silly (like in the opening scene, where a woman is "informed" that she has been raped and that her family has been slaughtered, just for the sake of exposition), this film is ultimately neither funny enough nor competent enough (as a straightforward adventure story) to be really enjoyable. i'll leave you to decide which may be the highlight, but the low point is probably the fight with a silly metallic dragon. brigitte nielsen was a good choice for sonja, with her fresh face and her firm, slightly muscular body (and i think that her dark-red hair suits her perfectly), but schwarzenegger gives one of his few colorless performances as calidor. (*1/2)

have just seen this film for the first time after purchasing it on dvdit comes across as a cheap attempt to cash in on the two conan movies.unfortunately, this film didn't appear to have the same budget as the conan films and hence some of the sets and effects aren't as flash and some scenes seem hurried. nielsen is ok to look at but unfortunately she couldn't act if a gun was put to her head. arnie's supporting role looked like it was done as a favor to director fleischer, who also directed conan the destroyer. maybe arnie wasn't confident that he would go on to headline films like predator, total recall, t2, etc.some of the female guardians of the talisman early in the film looked like they were struggling to lift their swords and the looks on their faces suggested they were having great fun making this film. i couldn't be so jovial if i was fighting for my life.all this aside, this film required very little concentration to watch and was mildly entertaining. i've seen a lot worse. two stars.

in the mid-1970s, my nyc apt. building was finally wired for cable-tv and since showtime (instead of hbo) was the only premium channel offered showing recent movies, i signed up for it. being a writer and night-owl by nature, i soon discovered the channel was showing movies late at night and until the wee hours of the morning i'd never even heard of--most of them american independent films and foreign films that had never been given a u.s. theatrical release. many of them had recognizable "star" casts and respectable directors, and thanks to showtime, i discovered many first-rate films i (and other showtime subscribers) would never else have had the opportunity to see. most of these cinematic mongrels were indeed "dogs" but often so bad they were unintentionally hilarious. one night, showtime unveiled a little italian-made gem called "redneck" (filmed in 1972, given a limited european release in 1973). even though the movie had never been released in the u.s., the mpaa rating was listed as an 'r'. since the director was one sylvio narizzano (the director who made his name with the glorious "georgy girl"), and the three leads were mark ("oliver") lester, fabio testi and telly savalas, i decided to give it a try. and found myself nailed to my tv screen in disbelief for 89 minutes. as i recall, savalas and testi played two criminals, the former a raging maniac who, in one stomach-churning scene, casually sent a german family to their deaths by nudging their trailer off a cliff, thereby plunging to the wilderness depths below. so far, so bad. then, out of nowhere, testi (as the "nice" psycho) and lester (all of 14 when the movie was made) are seen, both nude, in a men's room, testi sneaking peeks at the kid's body while shaving, and poor confused lester fixated on close-ups of testi's naked butt. as a not-yet-jaded member of the movie industry, and a card-carrying liberal (i was as much against censorship then as i am today), the entire movie made me queasy (and, being the early '70s when i thoughti'd seen everything in the anything-goes movies of that liberated era--including the uncut version of altman's "that cold day in the park", a real jaw-dropper until it was trimmed for an 'r' rating and would have spelled the end for altman's career had he not next come up with something called "m*a*s*h"), i still wonder if anyone else except me ever saw "redneck" and was appalled as i was. trashing the actors and movie-going audiences is joy maladjusted filmmakers have been merrily indulging in since the beginning of time. but leeringly exploiting a highly respected and talented child actor (mr. lester) at a time when he was beginning to make the difficult transaction from child to adult actor (and i'm sure his film offers had thereby dwindled to meretricious junk like "redneck")...mr. narizzano, you should be hanging your head in shame. (incidentally, i was soon to make friends with actors who had appeared in narizzano's future, undistinguished efforts. they both despised him. surprise?)

sdiner82 had clearly not seen the film in decades, and his memory is appalling. his attempts to paint the mark lester shaving scene as suspect are utterly erroneous, as are his incorrect comments about the bad guy "sneaking peeks at the kid's body". lester is clothed for the entire time the man is in the room, and the man barely gives him a glance.the scene is a crude attempt to show lester's innocent curiosity about the man's body.like everything in this film, it's badly done, but nothing more.even sdiner82's comments about savalas' character who "casually sent a german family to their deaths by nudging their trailer off a cliff" is nonsense (it was a single woman, she was already dead, and she was in a car).i suggest that sdiner82's review says far, far more about his own, far from liberal mindset, than it does about this valueless film.the only reason i even bothered to look it up, was out of curiosity to see if it was made before or after kojak.the film is a worthless piece of 70's trash, but sdiner82's review of it is the worst kind of slander. he wraps up his review in pseudo-intellectual "facts", but the only fact is that he is plain wrong on almost every "factual" matter he discusses.i can only assume that sdiner82 saw exactly what he looked for, which is disturbing. now he can return to burning copies of catcher in the rye.

i know a lot of people would claim certain films as 'the worst of all time' but i think redneck stakes a claim for this prize. a combination of quite dreadful acting from both mark lester and telly savales and plot progression that defies belief.on telly saveles: was he drunk when he acted in this? he seems to play a slurring, laughing lunatic with no sense of conviction. maybe he mixed his medication with his whiskey, i don't know.on mark lester: a performance more wooden than a carpenter's workshop. his clipped british tones don't belong in this film; and his transformation from sheltered teenager to gangster's apprentice in 24 hours is mad. and the strip scene with mosquito does not have any relevance to the plot at all; perhaps the director likes this sort of thing.plot logic: when memphis and mosquito ambush the car at the beginning, why doesn't mark lester's mother do or say anything to get her son out of the car, before the loonies drive it off? she just lets them all go, without saying a word!! on the other hand, redneck has to be seen - you won't believe how bad it is otherwise!

definitely not your typical polizia, redneck just never worked for me. the movie tells the story of a jewel heist gone wrong and a young boy who is inadvertently kidnapped in the process. in their attempt to get away, the robbers leave a bloody trail of death in their wake as they hatch a plan to ransom the boy. the plan is never carried off as the robbers are more intent on getting to france and the boy is intent on staying with them. while i could cite a number of problems i had with the movie, i'll focus on the most obvious  the character memphis played by telly savalas. from his work in the dirty dozen and kelley's heroes to other italian films like crime boss to his most remembered role as kojak, savalas was a winner. i've always thought of him as one uber-cool customer. unfortunately, savalas is almost unwatchable in redneck. did the director turn on the camera and instruct him to act as psychotic as possible? it might not have been too bad had his actions been done within the context of a plot i cared about, but here he seems to be acting bizarre for sake of being bizarre. it's appears to be random lunacy. and what's with that accent? savalas might have been a lot of things, but southern isn't one of them. he sounds completely ridiculous even attempting the accent. beyond that, i found little of interest in the rest of the movie. as i indicated, the plot never drew me in. i just didn't care about what was going on. and the notion that the boy is so quickly attracted to the criminal lifestyle doesn't ring true. as for the other actors, mark lester is almost as bad as savalas and the usually reliable franco nero isn't a whole lot better. three "name" actors and not a good performance between them. to make matters worse, i believe the director filmed many of the night scenes with nothing more than the glow from his watch to light the shots. i couldn't tell what was going on. characters i hate, a plot i don't care about, and a production values that failed  little wonder i've given redneck a 3/10.

a group of friends receive word from a pal who has found gold in an old mind shaft nearby an ancient abandoned western town of suttersville. despite warnings by the local sheriff, murphy(john phillip law), old man prichard(richard lynch)a bedraggled hick who swindles tourists with supposed collectible wanted posters, and kooky superstitious aunt nelly(karen black)to stay out of the mine due to it's notorious legend(..that an evil coal miner who sold his soul to devil and murdered a priest's(jeff conaway)daughter will return from the dead to kill those who remove the gold from his shaft), these people only see the green, not the blood red which could potentially ooze from their slain bodies. finding the gold of jeremiah stone intact, they line their pockets and carrying cases, prepared for the bright futures that supposedly lie ahead. but, when you do not heed the warnings of those you consider backwoods loons, the obvious result will be gruesome death. jeremiah stone, as we see, is lying merely a skeleton near an alter containing skulls lined next to each other as the candles on top of them light up, the pickax underneath awaiting it's master, with dust particles returning him to a grotesque corpse with demonic exposition, his eyes aglow with wrath. this hapless group, hoping for some fun around the campfire with gold providing them with warm prospects for life ahead, will fall prey to the vengeful ghoul and his mean pickax. another victim will meet the nasty end of a shovel thrown through the windshield of her vehicle, directing it's path straight into her neck. another failed attempt to retreat has stone causing a frightened victim to drive his car into a tree, his body engulfed in flames as he fails to escape without harm. another, a local girl searching for her new friends, worried about their well being, receives the pickax buried into her stomach. aunt nelly informs those still alive about the forty-niner and the curse on those who raids his eternal stash..and pays the price for relating such information. will anybody survive? or, is the entire group fated to perish at the hands of the zombie miner?make-up effects artist and monster creator, john carl buechler directs this supernatural slasher without worrying about logic or strong story-telling, opting instead to allow his zombie miner to destroy anyone and everyone who happens to be in his path. he provides just enough back story, and this is feeble at best, for the killer allowing special guest star, karen black(..oh how her career has sunken into the abyss)to explain to the viewer about him. the story given to us has the miner holding a priest's daughter hostage, threatening to execute her as the suttersville authorities warn against such an action. startling enough, stone plants that pickax right into her back, with the opposition unloading their guns with little effect because he sold his soul to satan. retreating to his domain, the mine shaft, stone sends out a warning against anyone even attempting to take what's his, the loot. typical of most slashers in general, this bunch of twenty-somethings are your garden variety victims, with little development other than some banter and exchanging of words provides as filler until the undead maniac pops onto the scene to slaughter them. they are the usual group, from the city, trespassing unto unfamiliar territory, resurrecting an evil that should remain dormant. like many of the later 80's slashers, a good deal of the violence is off-screen. what is on screen, the minimal gore, is rather mundanely presented and happens rather quickly. the ghoul make-up for the killer is only shown occasionally;he's mostly shrouded in darkness, the victims' horrified faces as he catches or chases after them are given more credence than the method of destruction. one thing's for certain, stunt men were set on fire many times. at least three times, a character is burned alive by either a lantern or flaming vehicle. martin cove has a minor cameo as black's former husband, caleb, now living with a much younger, and dense, honey. vernon wells(..of the road warrior and commando fame)has the back story role of jeremiah stone as a human, still capturing the same type of menace he specializes in. john phillip law seems to be enjoying himself as the rather polite and hospitable sheriff, welcoming the outsiders to his neck of the woods. buechler has quite an attractive cast of actresses, all wearing tight pants and smallish shirts, showing off their sleek and athletic figures, especially elina madison as easy-lay roxann, always willing to remove her clothes for greedy jerk, hayden(rick majeske). stephen wastell(the ghosts of edendale) is axl, a rather clumsy foil, used as a butt of many jokes including his "dump in the woods" scene and current unemployment status.

seen this one in a sneak preview yesterday and must say it was terrible. after the credits i thought: "hey with this cast it'll probably be pretty good". didn't at all turn out that way. lame predictable groaners, terribly simply drawn characters (maybe except a little ms. lara's) and an ending one could foresee 10 minutes into the movie. and worst of all, it misused a delicate theme (handicapped persons) for low level and mostly tasteless jokes without ever touching anything but the surface of the issue. the handicapped person the film sympathises with the most is the one who is just faking it. what kind of message is that? and the film doesn't have a thought through ending at all, it basically comes down to: "i love you, doesn't matter that you acted like a prick."to sum it up: great cast that must have been terribly bored to sign up for a terrible flick.

alexandra maria lara: a very beautiful and enticing woman, but not a good actress. in all the films i've seen her in, she appears to me as the exact same character. whether it be in the downfall, nackt, vom suchen und finden der liebe and now wo ist fred! she always is (plays?) the young, good-hearted woman, who is a little naive and doesn't know how to handle the things happening to her. she disposes of a repertoire of probably five different facial expressions that she works with abundantly. i personally have a hard time believing that she could play a mysterious and slightly obnoxious character because it just isn't in here. so she's typecast as the nice girl next door, which she is, but, once again, she ain't up to snuff when it comes to acting. til schweiger: same thing! the film: downright stupid. as it was an american movie it would have been a great role for adam sandler who i don't like either. i wasn't offended by the fact that this is a film with handicapped people in it, i just thought that the jokes resulting from this weren't funny at all. i chuckled twice or three times but when i was halfway through it, i was just bored and annoyed and wanted this flick to end.

be very afraid of anyone who likes this film. they probably inhaled too many paint chips as a child. its so awful i refuse to relive a plot. o yeah, there wasn't one! this movie is a true definition of what hollywood creates for people who don't want to think at a theatre. do the bad guys win? do the good guys win? who cares!

this movie is absolutely terrible... definately a bull***t story and even worse acting. too bad charlie sheen is involved in something like this since he is a decent actor and has done a couple of really good movies.the special effects are 'a-team'-standard with the classical car gets shot and then flips over with a little fireball under the hood.of course the enemy are portrayed as total idiots and die as fast as they can say '-die evil americans'.unless braindead movies are you game, don't spend 113minutes of your life on this rubbish. pick up 'the platoon' or 'apocalypse now' instead.

only saw this movie late last night. i remember the hype of it's release and to be honest had i viewed it back then i maybe wouldn't have been so generous. i hate hype, it can ruin a movie. i think the movie glossed over the characters and put too much emphasis on woody. he was good too - although kept wondering if he was stoned the whole time. it never went too deep. redford was dark but not too dark and his character let me down in the end. to me he should have been more confrontational with demi - throwing her out perhaps or telling her that she was paid for. after all he would have investigated them before he made the proposal - that's not shown in the movie, but no one in his perceived position would have made an offer to just anyone. he was cruel to the point of breaking them up and the last straw was the house and yet demi fell for him? the passages giving an insight to demi and woody's relationship were the best part of the movie. there was a keen deepness that outshone the shallowness of john gages character. he really could have been a lot stronger and as other people have alluded i think the movies draw-card was redford and they didn't want tarnish his "image". i say what the hell robert was old in this movie! woody and demi's characters were naive in a sense, but i think that was very intentional to draw you to their plight and champion their decision. but the reality is, they were losing their dream home and where did they go? las vegas? to gamble what little they had left and then accept a proposal from an insanely rich billionaire. i found their naivety when redford was seducing them a little too unrealistic. the movie could have been so much more and other actors would have made a difference, but having said that on late night tv - it was enjoyable and i if you don't think too much - also palatable

demi and woody are married, but they're poor. they meet robert redford, and he's really rich. he takes a fancy to demi, and since he's a gambling man he makes the couple an "indecent proposal:" one million dollars for a night with the little woman.at this point you need watch no more of the film because you can put the details together in your sleep. of course demi is going to accept the offer. if she doesn't there's no first half of the movie. of course it will affect demi and woody's marriage. if it doesn't there's no second half of the movie. and of course everything will turn out okay by the time the credits roll. if it doesn't, there's no happy ending for the sake of box office.the absolute best thing you can say about indecent proposal is that demi moore looks good in a black dress. as for the rest... the script is incompetent, the direction amateurish, the performances negligible. i suspect redford, moore, and harrelson blush and change the subject every time the film is mentioned. do them--and more importantly yourself--a favor. unless some one offers you a million... miss it!gary f. taylor, aka gft, amazon reviewer

spoilers throughout:not good. the movie differed completely from the book(not that the book was exactly a classic but it really was very good.)i guess demi moore was ok. actually, i don't really remember to much about her performance one way or the other. however the big disappointment wasn't with ms. moore.why did whoever did the rewrite decide to suddenly make the millionaire have a heart? (i'm referring to him as "the millionaire" because he also had a different name in the movie then the book version-just another change.)people who didn't read the book obviously won't know anything's different but in the book version this guy is much more ruthless as well as complex overall. he is also fascinating. the fact that such a big change was made in the movie alters the whole plot. it was almost like seeing a completely different movie.i know many movies vary widely from the books. but i also thought redford's character was a bit of a wimp. this isn't redford's fault(he's a great actor and could have played ruthless well) but without those qualities he becomes just another dazzled man in love hence the story becomes just another cliché love story involving 1 woman and 2 men. that wasn't really the point of the book.this could have been a lot better. even if i hadn't read the book version i wouldn't have liked this all that much, but changing so much around definitely takes it, for me, a few points down.

this movie received a great write up in blockbusters 'coming attraction' i was looking forward to the release date,08/07/02. the plot sounds reasonable, the cast alone should have guaranteed a side-splitter, but whoa there; apart from the 'off the wall betting events' this was quite a bore.this will never become a comedy classic, and i'm afraid it has done no help to the fine comedy reputation of john cleese. rowan atkinson, now he was quite funny, in a rowan atkinson sort of way!

if you are a fan of slap-stick that has terrible writing, awful acting and cliche after cliche this one is for you. there is far too much to list for the reasons why this movie sucks. in a brief synopsis, people with a combined iq of 100 journey to new mexico on a race for 200 million dollars. and yes they are all apparently super heroes, as they can do many things such as jump onto trains that are traveling 80+ mph, survive numerous car crashes, and endless instances of outright cartoonish roadrunner and coyote antics. if you are a teen, or dont want to think for a movie, this one is for you.. not one actor outside of lovitz is believeable at all.. lovitz saves the movie from a 1 with the hitler bit. 2/10 (save yourself the 2 hours of pain and $4)

eddie murphy and richard pryor team up in this would-be comedy about nightclub owners being squeezed by organized crime. eddie murphy wrote and directed this obnoxious ego trip, and therefore has no one to blame but himself for its failure. this is a genuinely bad film, so completely devoid of energy and humor that it serves only as a example of murphy's contempt for his audience. it would be remarkably easy to continue beating up on this movie, but i will show it more mercy than it showed its audience and stop now.

i wasn`t expecting much with harlem nights but i wasn`t expecting it to be as bad as it was . without doubt the worst aspect is the obscene language , it really is awful the amount there is in this film and before anyone accuses me of being a wimp let me point out two things...1 ) amongst my fave films i would include goodfellahs , platoon , raging bull while my favourite movie of all time is apocalypse now2 ) my all time favourite american television show is the hbo prison drama oz so you see films and television shows with massive amounts of swearing don`t normally bother me but the problem i had with harlem nights is to do with the fact it`s supposed to be a comedy but it seems the production team came to the conclusion that an audience laugh everytime someone ( especially if that someone is black ) says a rude word and decided to subsitute funny situations with swearing all the way through the film hoping to get a laugh. well i thought i`d never start laughing and i didn`t

just read through the other comments here, and was a little surprised to find that no one had said anything about the acting or plot.richard pryor and eddie murphy can both deliver an amazing stand-up comedy show. great actors they are not. enough about that.as for the plot? oh man. every time the movie tries to "fool" you into believing the good-guys are going to lose, you know those scenes: "what? the good-guys loses? oh.. i see, it was just a trick", it's done so terribly bad, you can spot it a mile away.it had 2 or 3 funny moments, but not enough to save the day.it's a little silly that these comments has to be 10 lines now. a lot of people will fill it up with crap, for it to be eligible. being brief is an art.

1989 was already a year in where eddie murphy wasn't that longer hot and started making movies that soon would be forgotten. funnily enough, it was also the year in where murphy directed his first film, but it also would be the first and last experiment. "harlem nights" wasn't exactly what you can call a success even if it was great to see the two best black comedians together namely murphy and richard pryor. don't blame it on the actors as they all played their roles like you expected them do, even if you have to face (again) the typical murphy-laugh. the worst thing from "harlem nights" are both the scenario and its terrible decors. everything is set in the roaring twenties and everybody has their profit from the forbidden clubs. sugar ray (pryor) and his adopted son quickie (murphy) are gathering easily 10000 dollar per day but of course soon the mob and the corrupt police come around the corner to claim their part of the cookie. sugar and quickie aren't guys who give their money for free and have their own plans. you can watch "harlem nights" that's for sure, but if you puke from the moment you hear the name murphy you better avoid as after all this movie is nothing but a lame excuse to see some good jokes.

this is truly one of the worst movies ever made--and i don't mean in a so-bad-it's-good kind of way. eddie murphy is a great comic, and it is a testament to how bad this movie is that it nearly killed his career. the writing and direction are inept, the sets and staging about as imaginative as a brady bunch episode, and the acting shows just how bad a great cast can be when they have absolutely nothing to work with. if it weren't for the costumes--which, aside from eddie murphy's ego, seem to account for the major part of the budget--you would swear this thing was slapped together by a bunch of high schoolers wasted on peppermint schnapps. that anyone could find this travesty in any way funny or entertaining is mind-boggling. it's probably no coincidence that the misguided souls who are praising this stinker are barely literate. but if your idea of hilarity is della reese getting her "pinkie toe" shot off, then by all means, put aside your drool cup and go rent this movie.

by dane youssefi was kind of looking forward to this one. i enjoy eddie murphy and i love it when a star hand-makes a vehicle for themselves or when someone who writes decides to mark their own directorial debut. but when the star's head gets too big for the rest of his body, there's always a danger of a big-budgeted hollywood vanity production.will the filmmaker keep it real or will he just waste amounts of money (the studio's, ours) and time (the studio's, ours & his own) patting himself on the back for an hour in a half? sadly, it's the latter here.another thing i really like is when someone breathes new and fresh life into an exhausted and dried-out genre. none of that here. the warring nightclub movies have become so worn-through that even the parodies of it are dreary and done to death. murphy does neither. he does the most clichéd: he plugs into a routine conventional formula gangster picture and plays it as seriously as if it were "the godfather." it's like a script where the next draft, they put in the jokes and the new ideas. but it seems like someone with clout just looked at it and went: "no this is fine."probably murphy. he is credited all over this. in the opening shot of beautiful white satin sheets, his name headlines across the credits about five times.the plot: a young orphan saves pryor's life and pryor adopts the little ragamuffin. 20 years later, pryor's dump has become a first-class hot spot. they're pulling down big money and a gangster wants their action. he's even got a dirty cop in his employ. but pryor comes up with a scheme, a la "the sting." murphy's screenplay plays like an unfinished first-draft that nobody had the pair to call him on. the actors aren't really allowed to stand-out much, if at all. even the almighty murphy seems to be on auto-pilot. pryor shows class and gentlemanly manners as sugar ray (perhaps it would have been better to name his character brown sugar rayfurther evidence that this one needed a polish), but everyone here is basically just on vacation. the oscar-nomination the movie received is richly deserved (joe i. tompkins' best costume design), but the production values are the only part that makes the '30's feel authentic. some sets look somewhat fake, but this is supposed to be a comedy of sorts. it's rare one movie gets nominated for both a razzie and an oscar (unless it's one of lucas' new "star wars" chapters).it's 1938 and everyone is talking like it's 1988, particularly the comedians. this is a prehistoric white man's formula. and with all these black comedians and satirists, you expect them to skewer the genre or at least bring new life to it. nope. murphy is pretty much just coasting here.the great roger ebert summed it up perfectly when he remarked in his review: "murphy approaches his story more as a costume party in which everybody gets to look great while fumbling through a plot that has not been fresh since at least 1938." jasmine guy is perfectly cast and seems to be indulging herself in her role and michael lerner has all the looks, evil and mannerisms of the prototypical mob boss down pat. and there are moments where pryor gives you an idea of what a more interesting leader and authority figure would sound like. he gives every scene he's in a feeling of dignity.would it have been too much to ask that della resse sing? or at least quit embarrassing herself with all her "kiss my ass talk?" and the late redd foxx doesn't get to leave much of a swan song here. he has some back-and-forth with resse which could have been some great stuff. nope. murphy wastes another opportunity again here.murphy's quick is charismatic and likable. but those moments are few and far between for sure. murphy has never looked better and never been duller. his character made me laugh twice throughout the whole movie.stan shaw's boxer with a horrible speech impediment isn't just painful and embarrassing, it's annoying. there's more to comedy than simply showing something unpleasant. you have to incorporate some kind of light touch and funny situation. watching him strain even the some of the easiest words just makes us feel sorry for him and annoyed with murphy.can murphy write a screenplay? well there was "raw," but that was really stand-up material. he wrote the outline for "boomerang" and "coming to america" for sure. but her didn't have the last word there. maybe a team of er-like script doctors could've revived this one.murphy's direction is so slow and quiet, you'd swear he was asleep at the wheel some of the time. he has too many static shots and doesn't seem to know how to build and release suspense. on some level, i think quick is the real eddie murphy. angry, young, hot-headed and ambitious. but occasionally charming. now if he were only funny sometime.there's a scene in which murphy has a femme fa-tale in bed who plans to make love with him and kill him. you can probably guess how it turns out. like everything else in the movie, this could have been better, but "surprisingly," murphy has not directed another movie since (he got a razzie nomination). and he no longer writes the finished draft for his films either (he won the razzie for writing this!) it's great to look at and the music is beautiful, and there are a few really nice scenes. but that just falls under the category of "gems among all the junk." not enough of them.couldv'e been. shouldv'e been. wasn't. oh, well.by dane youssef

produced at a point in his career, where he had the juice to do whatever he wanted, eddie murphy took on the task of producing, directing, co-writing and starring in harlem nights, an expensive-looking but ultimately empty gangster saga about a group of black nightclub owners/gangsters running a ritzy club during the 1930's, headed by a wisecracking hot shot (eddie murphy)and his adopted father (richard pryor) and their attempts to avoid being overrun by white gangsters who think they are taking over turf that, it seems, they think is rightfully theirs, simply by virtue of their color. this was an idea that probably looked great on paper but it definitely lost something in the translation. this was a vanity piece for eddie and i think he spreads himself a little too thin here trying to be the whole show here. admittedly, it was a pleasure seeing murphy and pryor together on screen, but the rest of the large supporting cast, including arsenio hall, redd foxx, della reese, michael lerner, danny aiello, jasmine guy, thomas mikal ford, stan shaw, and eddie's brother, are really given precious little to do (though i will admit murphy's fight scene with della reese is hysterically funny and probably, the movie's best scene). murphy clearly poured a lot of money into this film and a good deal of it shows on screen. the art and set direction are impressive and the breathtaking costumes should have won an oscar, but this one was a big miss for eddie as he definitely tried to wear too many hats.

this takes place in 1920s harlem. a black owned nightclub has to deal with gangsters and corrupt policemen.terrible vanity project for eddie murphy. it tries to mix comedy and drama and fails at both. the comedy simply isn't funny and the drama is boring and badly acted. you think a film with three comedy legends--eddie murphy, redd foxx and richard pryor--would be great but it isn't. there's nonstop swearing and the opening scene has a young boy shooting a man to death (this is shown as being ok). also we have the beautiful della reese degraded into playing a madam. one of the "comedic" highlights has a long, unfunny and terribly vicious fight between her and murphy. a boring, offensive and stupid mess. not the worst murphy movie but pretty close. a 1 all the way.

in the 1930s, hal roach studios was on top of the comedy world with such stars as laurel and hardy, charley chase and the little rascals. most of these films are exceptional and have withstood the passing of time. however, a lesser-known roach product was the pairing of thelma todd and zasu pitts (later, todd was paired with the equally untalented patsy kelly). try as i might, i just can't stand these pictures--they just aren't funny. plus, unlike laurel and hardy, there was not an ounce of chemistry between todd and her two co-stars. before you just think i am a crank, understand that i have seen and reviewed several hundred roach films as well as many other early comedies, so i am well acquainted with the genre and within the genre, this team is among the worst. part of the reason i think i am right about the team is that as a lower-tier team at roach, they were given all the scripts no one else wanted. if stan or ollie hated a given plot idea, it was often given to todd and pitts/kelly--and usually it showed.in this film, however, the team is at their absolute lowest. it's hard to imagine a comedy with less laughs and a more contrived plot. the film begins with zasu in the jury and thelma as a defense lawyer. as for zasu, she's a completely annoying moron. not the lovable type moron (like stan laurel or lou costello), but just a totally annoying and grating person who is pushy and obnoxious. as for thelma, as usual, she's the rather bland "straight man" and as such has little to do but react to zasu's boorish behavior.the plot involves thelma defending a client who is accused of selling exploding diet pills. considering that the pills are highly dangerous, when the attorney asks zasu to try swallowing one it just seems dumb. and, while they were called "pills", they were more like giant black blobs that were larger than golf balls. swallowing them only seemed contrived and made no sense--even for a low-brow comedy. when they find she has swallowed the pill and it really is explosive, everyone panics and runs about like idiots until the film ends.as i said, i am not a fan of this team. however, even for those who want to like the film, there isn't one legitimate laugh in the entire short! when i talked over this review with my wife (who also saw the movie with me), she thought my score of 2 was overly generous!!

peter yates film from the pen of steve tesich is a relatively low key "thriller" that doesn't really manage to get off the ground. story concerns the mysterious murder of an influential asian business man and the subsequent implication of a pathetic vietnam veteran (james woods) who, the police believe, may have taken revenge on his ex-employer. as the "eyewitness", william hurt never believes his friend is capable of such an act.hurt is well below his usual strength, and one finds it hard to sympathise with him or an uninspired sigourney weaver. james woods and christopher plummer do a little better in their support roles. worth noting is the appearance of morgan freeman as detective black.in retrospect steve tesich's story is only an unlikely romance dressed up as a mystery flick. the plot is far too contrived.friday, october 17, 1997 - video

i'm a collector of films starring ms. weaver, so i bought this only because of her being in it. i find it really odd that her early career is filled with so many awful movies. she started with incredible promise in alien but then had a slew of bombs. these bombs include this movie, deal of the century, one woman or two, and half moon street. she also appeared in the year of living dangerously, which was not a bomb, but her performance was less than notable. in the time between alien and it's 1986 sequel, aliens, the only movie she did that was worth anything was ghostbusters. before the release of aliens, i'm sure everyone thought this woman was on her way out. luckily she wasn't.back to eyewitness though, the film is boring. it doesn't create any suspense. william hurt seems like a cardboard stand in, and the atmosphere is just to dry. sigourney is decent but nothing worth remembering.watch this movie if you must but don't go in with any expectations of a decent movie. watch better movies with these two stars like accidental tourist and working girl.

a bare-faced rip-off of se7en and not fit to clean its shoes. the word 'predictable' must have invented for just such an occasion as this. lambert is wooden, as always (his moments of 'emotion' are laughable, as is his accent). the 'climax' is not that at all as we've had so many signals, and by the end we're simply immune to flesh, rotting and otherwise. altogether a real mess.

ok. first said, i just wanted to check whether this movie has an average rating below or exactly -1. but 5,9. this is sicker than any of the killers' proceedings -,- . that made me curious what people wrote here.. which in the end made me set up an account to give my 2cents of truth into this "well of delusion" i find here.how dare you guys even mention this movie in the same sentences as e.g. seven? the only thing they got in common is that they show various crime-scenes. that-is-it. and "best thriller of 1999!" ? have you even watched another movie form that year? or any other movie in your life at all? 1999 is not a year which people are reminded of by resurrection... what's with actual movies like 8mm, eyes wide shut, arlington road, double jeopardy? (theyre actually more a "thriller" than this one could ever be..). resurrection does not even deserve to be dedicated to a second of 1999.really, you guys can't be serious. i watched that movie yesterday with my girlfriend, highly recommended by a friend of her. a "great film with christopher lambert"! ...which i had not yet seen? hmm.. well, first look on the covers: ok, nothing special. at second glimpse you don't need to have supernatural powers to be aware that they simply mirrored lambert's head, clipped his nose 'n this&that, then made a fancy negative pattern on top of it, to get the killers image on the cover. you could even think they had some apprentice eat a gallon of marshmallows just to caption that creepy (booooh! -.- ) mouth.. whatever. turned it around and the plot starts with.. "it's raining in chicago... blabber blabber". come on, a six year old could have made that snippet sound more exciting. now, with this enormous excitement coming from the movies terrific presentation -.- , you absolutely wanna start watching it. because it can't be that bad, it still is christopher lambert. that assumption of mine was proved wrong. with "proven wrong" i mean it was brutally executed by a deadly mix of the worst imaginable acting ever known to mankind (every actor, but the tops are the "i can do 1-liners!" police chief, prudhommes wife __ actually a better detective than prudhomme when she recombines several incidents to a yet absolutely unknown hint in the case!!!! -.- __ and .. yes.. prudhomme himself) featuring a squadron of inhuman fake feelings, logic errors in a 1-minute-cycle, light-years far-fetched conclusions which in my point-of-view represent an insult to any thinking human being and last but not least a camera-man who obviously was a hyperventilating kangaroo. oh well, and if you do not completely shut down your brains (these aren't premises to watch it) then you should know who is who and what is what after max. 30minutes, simply because you know any scene after the first. that is thrilling. thrilling because this movie almost makes you think you can tell the future. the bottom line: this is by far the worst movie i can remember. trust me, i've seen many horrible movies which in some way were at least only bad attempts or bad copies of another movie. resurrection however, is the best example on how to fail in every aspect possible. it was so bad that after being shocked by its unimaginably low quality in e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g, i laughed more often than in any recent comedy, simply because i was fascinated by the crew's brazenness to publish such an -extraordinary- film strip. good thing for lambert he was in highlander:endgame a year later, thus he can be pardoned. ;^oanyhow, i do recommend watching this movie to everyone. in the end, we had great fun watching it :^d. i guarantee you, after you completely watched resurrection (be brave, you can do it!) , you will worship the level of acting in any given daily soap. or just go 'n watch highlander one more time... that's what i'm gonna do.

this film truly was poor. i went to the theatre expecting something exciting, and instead was afforded the opportunity to hone my "guess the next plot twist before it happens" skills. seriously, the plot was written with an extra thick crayon so everyone could see. nothing was truly shocking. in fact, even the gore was met with such complete suspension of belief that it really didn't add up to much.the excessive wise cracking and cops talking shop at the crime scenes made it seem all the more phony. and the scene where lambert's character is struggling with the clues and reaches his "investigative epiphany" goes to great lengths to indicate the level of intellect expected from the audience - little.probably the most annoying aspect of the cinematography was the "x-files" treatment: every building in the film, whether it's the precinct building, or a house at noon, or a hospital, was suffering from a lack of any discernible lighting (not to mention a lack of 'patients' in the case of the hospital). i don't recall a single scene when someone flipped on a light switch. it sure would have been nice.mr. lambert really isn't an oscar-grade actor, so i suppose you have to take this film for what it's worth. in the end, i've reached the conclusion that the only thing that would make this film seem more entertaining is to watch it after watching "the warriors". otherwise, you're left with an effort that is dull and unoriginal, and nowhere near the equal of films of the genre such as "silence of the lambs".

overrated, poorly written, badly acted. did the academy even watch this? i guess not. the political content guaranteed it an oscar nomination -- indo -pak border -- a little boy , terrorism. anything with the word "terrorist" gets attention inthis post 9-11 world. its like holocaust movies that are guaranteed an oscar nomination irrespective of their merits. and please cinematography does not mean shooting landscapes which are pretty in the first place. you have to be a rotten shooter to screw up making the desert pretty. at least this didn't win the oscar. they got that right at least. would have been a travesty.

i spotted the dvd on a store near my home, and since i'm a "cheesy horror movie/alien flicks" addict, i wondered how good it was. it even had two award mentions on the cover (i don't remember what festival it won) so i figured "hey this might be good". so i bought it (for five euros) and i came here to imdb to check out some reviews. here, either people bashed the movie to say it was bad, or people said the movie was a wonderful feat in indie movies bla, bla. i then played the dvd, not thinking about any review i had read, with an open mind, and not expecting anything at all.man... i don't' like being this critical, but the movie was genuinely bad... ok, i'm just going to give out some pointers of what i thought:1-acting/dialog: the acting was so confusing... sometimes the actors did a decent job, but there were scenes were i could spot no effort at all from them! the dialog was even worst... i think it was probably the aspect i most disliked in the whole movie. the talking in between characters seemed... off. not just bad, but far away from the actual happenings in the movie. the monologues of the female character, although well delivered, became boring and annoying in a little while... but of course the most ridiculous aspect was the... "aliens" or the "infected"... i wont even comment on that one, just going to say that it was absolutely ridiculous and took the entire mood away from the picture; 2-visuals: the strongest aspect in the movie... if you forget the awful fx and light flashes they used to simulate explosions or what the hell they were supposed to be. the "camera in car" aspect was quite cool actually, but they didn't even used the environment to inspire fear or dread. they left that to cheap sound and video fx and the three "infected" characters. the movie becomes boring in so many scenes...; 3-sound: talk about editing... this movie has no problems in showing how weakly edited it was. from computer sounds imitating the forest animals to the "alien dialog"... ah...so what did i like in the movie... (spoilers) the only thing i really liked and it was actually quite scary was the succession of two scenes where the car is still and you spot something/someone walking in a distant. at first i really thought it was me seeing things, but when the character realizes that the "figures" coming towards her were her own reflection, i was surprised! pretty creepy idea done well! apart from that... i had an awful time.and i don't recommend this to anyone... not even "teen get together" because you can't even laugh at this...i give it a solid 2. only some technical achievements worked here... apart from that... yeah... nothing

army private gene kelly, who's also a talented trapeze aerialist, comes under fire for doing daring stunts without a net and alienating his high-wire cohorts; meanwhile, there's an elaborate 'camp show' to put on for army soldiers and personnel, and the whole studio of m-g-m has shown up to join in the fun. mickey rooney plays m.c. (unctuously), introducing acts like kay kyser and his orchestra, bob crosby, benny carter, and the m-g-m dancing girls (who appear to be dressed as vegetables). red skelton does a cute bit with donna reed and margaret o'brien, but the other comedic bits suffer from an apparent vacuum between the performers and the allegedly-live audience (they're awfully silent until the editor cuts to them for exaggerated reaction shots). judy garland sings an inappropriate song about a jumpin' night at carnegie hall (improbably accompanied by classical pianist josé iturbi, whom judy calls 'hep'). the production is glossy, but the manic energy feels false, fabricated. ** from ****

jumpin' butterballs, this movie stinks! it's a dull and listless drag that never lets up. it's a wonder anyone even bothered to make groucho up in his bizarre trademark eyebrows and mustache, as he has nothing witty or outrageous to do or say throughout this bore. chico must have been so disinterested that he forgot to use his italian accent.only harpo provides a grin or two, and there's precious little of that to go around here anyway. figure in a loudmouthed hotel manager and another obnoxious co-comic in frank albertson, and the road gets even bumpier. a real misfire.

picking this up along with the rest of the marx brothers box set, i found myself disappointed by most everything beyond a night at the opera. this stinker is prolly the worst i've seen of them so far, with the clever lines left out and the characterization is woeful. the playwright is so obscenely stupid in this play it's hard not to tackle the television and try and strangle him.as it is, the marxes seem to do better as outsiders brought in to wreak havoc, and are much much better when they have a good gag or two at least. the material here is all obviously written for anyone, and it really wastes the marx's talent. avoid. rating: 3/10

this film is likely to be a real letdown unless you understand the circumstances under which it was made. the marxes were chosen to be cast in the film version of a play that was not originally written for them. they are sort of force-fitted into the roles. ironically it might have been funnier if it had used different actors who did not have such high expectations placed upon them. instead, it has been forever enshrined as part of a canon to which it really doesn't deserve to belong.

************* spoilers below ************* "'night, mother" is the story of jesse (sissy spacek), a divorced epileptic woman who calmly announces to her brash mother (anne bancroft) that she's going to commit suicide. this is a fascinating premise that is drained of all vitality and excitement. the brilliant hook turns out to be a cheat- the story that follows is lacking in substance, gravity and revelatory value. where are the shocks and surprises as mother and daughter have what may be the last conversation of their lives? where are the secrets revealed, the confessions and fantasies and regrets? they're here, but they've all been painted the same dull color that keeps emotion in the background and celebrates the 'genius' of playwright marsha norman at the expense of everything else. the result is not a film but an exhausting endurance test.let me preface my comments by saying i find sissy spacek to be one of the greatest actresses in the history of motion pictures, a woman so magnetic, so natural that she continues to surprise and amaze me after twenty years of stardom. she brings a touch of class and magic to everything she does, and i've seen her rescue more than one film from the recycling bin with her angelic face and vulnerable eyes, her soft voice and sweet smile. it was because of the great spacek that i watched this film in the first place, and for one of her movies to be terrible it has to fail in a significant way. this film fails in two.first and foremost the film is adapted so faithfully from the pulitzer-winning stage play that it is claustrophobic and repetitive. the entire movie is a two-woman dialogue between jesse and her mother. what worked on stage- a middle-aged mother and daughter argue for two hours in small house- dies on film. a play, no matter how great, needs to be *adapted* for the screen it is self-indulgent and arrogant to believe that the dialogue is so perfect that not of a word of it can be altered. the screenplay for this film could have been shortened by thirty to forty pages, and a knowing screenwriter would have given the brilliant spacek and competent bancroft some *physical* sequences, some facial reactions, something to break up the wall-to-wall yak fest and prison-like single-set. it is no wonder that the screenplay was adapted by the original playwright marsha norman, who may know theater but reveals herself here to be clueless in film.i cannot over-emphasize the effect the stage-play script has on the film. watching jesse and her mother argue about jesse's impending suicide is redundant and dull. the women walk from the living room into the kitchen into the den and back into the living room, where they start all over again. a tiny midwestern house is not the ideal location for a single-set film, and the director never tries anything clever or original, never tries to break up the monotony with an exterior shot or cutaway or a flashback or *anything*. there's no music, no other characters, no other stories... just two women covering the couch cushions and arguing their opinions. the reverence given to the play is sickening even shakespeare's most solemn classics get shaken up for the screen. the commitment to the original play seems almost spiteful it's as if the film was made only to document the dramatic treasure that was the stage play, with the audience an afterthought.the other reason the film fails is anne bancroft. she may be a good stage actress but on film- where presence is 80% of performance- she rarely seems to fit. she certainly doesn't fit here, playing a midwestern grandmother but looking more like mrs. robinson before her morning coffee. she chases jesse around the house, looking more aggravated than astounded, and seems extraordinarily unsympathetic, even when her lines convey a loving- if flawed- woman.sissy spacek is great as she always is, honest and open and so good that you actually understand and agree with her character's choice. sissy lets us see that jesse is a flat tire, a wrong turn of a woman who has had every bad break and made too many wrong choices. she's never had control of her life, and her suicide will be her way of finally saying "no more- this is where i get off." that's how she puts it anyway, and when spacek speaks you listen. she proves in all her films that a good actress doesn't have to behave like a man, doesn't have to be all bluff and bravado and borrowed testosterone. in this and in films like "coal miner's daughter" she quietly demonstrates a soft strength and quiet depth that is as impressive as it is hypnotic you can't help but fall in love.that's why it was so hard for me to watch "'night, mother." spacek is wasted in a stilted stunt of a film that never serves to engage or even distract. i would not recommend this movie to anyone except die-hard fans of sissy like myself and even then you'll be disappointed. i do give the film an entire letter grade bonus for the ending, which is courageous enough to let the lead character do what's right for *her* and not pander to a hackneyed happy ending. grade: c

i had the privilege of seeing this powerful play on broadway with kathy bates in the lead. i only saw one other play in the 1970's-1990's that had an emotional impact like this play did. i really looked forward to the play being made into a movie but was very disappointed when i learned that kathy bates wouldn't reprise her role in the film--she wasn't well known off broadway at the time and the producers must have wanted star power i suppose and cast sissy spacek instead. sissy did an adequate job in the lead role but did not measure up to kathy bates in any way. i love anne bancroft but she seemed too young for this role. the movie plot was true to the play. anyone who ever contemplates suicide should have to watch this movie to realize the devastation on those who are left behind.

i like the concept of csi, but the show is spoiled by some seriously wooden acting. the medical examiner has the best lines and delivers them in an arch, offhand manner that livens up the story. unfortunately he has little screen time.also, why does jorja fox always look and act so utterly unhappy? i know that forensic investigation is a very serious business, but the characters, for the most part, seem to confuse seriousness with humorlessness and a complete lack of personality. i can't imagine dating either sarah sidle or catherine willows; what would you talk to either one about? i'm waiting for the episode when, at the end of a shift, catherine picks up a remote control, points it at grissom, shuts him down, and wheels him into a closet until the next day.

my ratings: acting - 3/10 suspense - 2/10 character attachment - 1/10 plot - 2/10 character development - 2/10 overall - 2/10this show sucks very much officially. for me, csi miami is the best, csi ny 2nd and csi 100th. i don't know, in the other csis you get into the episode you're watching. but in this one, you just can't get into the episode, no matter how much you try, so in my opinion, this show is not worth watching. i know people have different opinions, and i respect that, but for me, this csi ain't good enough. so if you like suspense, real acting/performance, good plot, direction, character development/attachment and you an overall good show, i suggest you to watch csi miami.

one: your screen will be filled with beautiful effects and colours. these do nothing for the story, but they will keep your lazy eyes occupied for some 50 minutes. a good example is the eternal use of a computer screen that shows each fingerprint from the database as that print is compared with the one they want to find out about. yeah, right.two: these guys being like real professional pros, they will engage each other in intriguing pro talk: "look, grissom, these are what we call fingerprints. everybody has them, and they are different on each person. so, with these fingerprints we can actually find...".yup! exactly like real pros would talk to each other if there wasn't a completely uninformed and stupid audience around.however, not everything about this show is bad. some stories work to some degree, and the colours _are_ really beautiful. they use red, blue, green, yellow... all of them colours i've loved since kindergarten.

what exactly is the point of pretending to "con" people out of things like ski passes and pizza? i fail to see a point. i'd not clever or original and it strikes me as being extremely pointless. skyler stone doesn't seem to be a very down-to-earth or even a nice guy. he has very little charisma and just about anyone could do what he does in this show. the worse thing about this piece of crap, is the fact that a lot of the phone calls are reenacted, so not only are they apparently conning the poor people on the other end of the phone, but they are also conning the audience who don't have enough time to read the "disclaimed" that flickers across the screen for about half a second at the beginning at the end of the show!not only that but he also claims this is how he lives his whole life. what an lie. no one could live their lives like this and the fact he says this is not only yet another con to get his show watched, but it's also one of the most fabricated, blatant pieces of bull$hit i've ever heard. this guy is an @$$!what makes them think that going to all the trouble of, for example, write and record a song, get someone to pain a huge picture of you and two mates, get dance lessons and actually travel to a ski resort is actually worth only getting free ski passes and some food for free? what is the point of that? it's an awful lot of trouble to go to just for a few ski passes and a bit of snow. as far as "comedy" goes, this is bottom of the barrel stuff.

i have decided to flush this show from my memory down the toilet of bad tv show into the obscurity of forgetful, disappointing, pointless, garbage tv show hell.the skyler guy who is the host/star/creator of this show is boring, uninteresting, unbelievable, not particularly good looking and not at all funny, in short why is this guy on tv and especially why is he in a comedy show when he's not funny, pretending to be a professional con man when he definitely is nothing but an obvious pretender? others have said it here already but this guy is a total fake and fraud, if you believe any of these cons i think you should seriously consider going to get your head checked because they're all fake, and the ones that might possibly be true are so pointless, like spending all day to con someone out of giving you an average meal at a restaurant? seriously this guy needs to go away, glad this show got canned.

on top of the fact that skylar is a complete douche bag and his cons are unimaginative, his schemes require way to much preparation to make any of his scams worth while. without giving away any spoilers (as if it matters with this piece of crap) his cons are such a sham because it takes the effort of days and days of planning, and the use of multiple accomplices and an entire camera crew etc. just to scam someone into a service that would cost less than a hundred bucks.....in addition if you read in the credits they re-stage some of the phone calls etc. because they don't pan out...the whole concept of this show is bunk because all of his cons have the cost in both the crew and the effort of ten times the actual cost of the service he is trying to get for free...what is the con?

scarier than any horror movie ever made because you're in controlled of this blood fest which make it more scarier than watching other people doing it on the big screen or on your television screen. this game got two cds which make the game much more entertaining.each cd contains a different character with a complete different story line which make the game much more fun. i recommend you to buy this game and the first game too (isn't as good as this game, still fun though)****

my overall feeling about this film is that it was a slow, drawn-out, structureless wander through some of the worlds genuinely unfortunate situations with a bit of redemption and an obvious message. the film is composed mostly of fairly uninteresting video footage of the countries he visits with bad reenactments, all slow-mo'ed down to a snails pace and overlaid with depressing music. certainly some of the materials and interviews contain some compelling stories, but unlike what the description on the back suggests, it wasn't so much the victim's story that's being told as it is the director's, mr. ripper, and he doesn't tell it well. this film could have included longer, better interviews with the people themselves, letting them tell their stories. instead mr. ripper indulgently draws the story towards himself making it some kind of personal journey, and unfortunately it doesn't end up being much of one. i never really got a sense of any growth as he explores the subject, and he never indicates what about the subject pulled him in in the first place. he just drags us from one place to the next, brushes lightly on the situation and characters, hangs around showing too much uneventful slow-motion footage of people just walking around the streets, then moves on to his next destination. he does this over, and over, and over again without any real development. i felt like this film could have been cut down to 45 minutes but it's drawn out to close to 2 crushingly slow hours. we feel morally obliged to care about the topic, but the director's self-indulgent, meandering, uninspired delivery of his journey makes you grow numb after a while.

but then again, what ever is? i picked this up at my local 99cent store for, you guessed it, 99 cents (plus tax). i remember seeing this on video as a teen and thinking it was a cool flick. too bad the film and my memories don't match. regardless, its not a too horrible way to blow a couple hours, and it is neat to see some vintage bill paxton and mark hamill. blah.... blah.... blah.... man, oh man, i cannot think of anything else to say about this flick... (just filling space to meet the ten line rule...) good golly, this is pathetic, just how bad is this movie that the best i could come up with in regards to it were five frickin'lines of text? so anyway, ten lines of text, eh? hmmm, ten lines are hard to come by when you can't remember squat about a film you just watched.

awful wot more can i say i remember seeing it in the cinema (see how it sticks painfully in the memory)as a 16 yr old lad. mark hamill was the older generations skywalker and wasn't great at that, he was worse in this. plus a dour soundtrack by then jericho aaaaarrrrrrgggggghhhhhh. there is one film equally as bad as this i saw in the cinema arthur 2 on the rocks. funny how that question "what is the worst film you have ever seen is?" is easier than "what is the best film?" which incidentally varies between the italian job (original), untouchables, casino, things to do in denver, goodfellas (getting a sense of what i like??? - this will fool you!) finding nemo, pirates of the caribbean and moulin rouge! please never watch this film or it will stick in your memory too!

i saw this film when it first came out in the cinema. we were all looking forward to seeing mark hamill relaunch his career, but we came out wishing we hadn't bothered. many people walked out after about half an hour - i wish i had too. the basic premise seems okay, but the plot was ridiculously involved and tortuous, and runs out half way through. its completely unmemorable, and not a film you want to have paid money to see. if you're really bored and it's on tv, then it'll help you kill a couple of hours (or help you to nod off!). 2/10

the film has so much potential which was not developed. mark hamill gives a good performance and so does bill paxton. the scenery is beautiful and the ultralight aircraft are neat. the problem with this film is that the story is way underdeveloped and the plot goes nowhere. the film at certain points almost puts you to sleep. i give it 3 out of 10 stars for the flying scenes.

wow !! i didn't even know about this movie until i was searching for the name of another mark hamill classic (time runner). some things are better left unknown. mark hamill's role is quite ... limited. i would compare his appearance in this movie to all those appearances of vincent price and christopher lee in those bad horror b-movies of the 60's and 70's. in those movies, they appeared in the the first and last 5 minutes of the movie. memorable acting by mark with such great lines as "don't try to run. you're under arrest." did i mention he says that exact thing more than once. bill paxton fell into an uzumaki type spiral of drugs and booze after aliens, because he ended up in this movie after waking up on the set after a binge session. the hair .. the hair !!! .. priceless bill. truly should have been "game over" for bill .. but somehow .. he got treatment .. and went on to better??? movies. this movie blows. it is more dull and boring than the crazies. at least that movie was crazy... this is just boring. do not watch this movie sober.

yeeee-haa! i have seen it argued that most american movies are cowboy movies in disguise; that hollywood is so in love with it's only truly original creation that it keeps reinventing the cowboy myth. i'm not sure i totally buy that argument but slipstream is evidence in support of the theory; it's a cowboy movie with aeroplanes. actually it goes one better than that. it's a spagetti western with aeroplanes! substitute the planes with horses, make the android a priest and this movie would be indistinguishable from any one of a dozen italian spanish semi-arty "shoot-'em-ups with pretensions" of the seventies.the film isn't as bad as i had been lead to believe by some of the reviews i had read here but it certainly wasn't good.

combine good casting, bad writing, good orchestral scoring, bad dialogue, and good story idea with lots of potential but is never realized then you have slipstream. just bought the movie for a buck, it is worth it, but not much more. good to see mark hamill act again. there should be a decent sequel made to remedy the damage from the original. or at least give it the proper attention it should have received in the first place. berstein's score gave demanded your attention from the opening credits, however, the long shots of slipstream planes and the even longer revealing of interesting plot points mutes his attention getting score. it is really easy to dog a movie like this, after all it is by the producer of starwars and the director of tron and a tremendous cast but it is what it is. and that ain't much.favorite line- "we're going to make it, ha-ha!...(boom!)"

the quote above just about says it all for "slipstream". i should have bailed out of this film after the first half hour, but decided i ought to be fair and give it a chance. i won't watch it again, so if anyone with the temerity to do so can get back to me with the number of clichéd lines in the movie, i'm sure it will set a record.some otherwise fine and talented actors got mixed up with this clunker; mark hamill portrays a futuristic bounty hunter and bill paxton is his quarry. paxton's character has hijacked hamill's prisoner, an android taking his name from the poet byron (bob peck). tasker (hamill) shoots owens (paxton) with a dart containing a tracking device so he and his companion belitski (kitty aldridge) can keep tabs on the pair. the real question though is why didn't he just fire the device at byron thereby cutting out the middleman.if you enjoy scene after disjointed scene with tedious characterization and artsy fartsy pretense, then i suppose you'll find something of interest here. but you can't convince me that the film makes sense on any level. scenes of a futuristic stone age make way for high society snobbery, but the pinnacle of poor taste is reached when paxton's character is displayed following a night of revelry with hickeys all over his torso. if anyone thinks there's some hidden meaning here, you're really stretching.patiently waiting for the frame proclaiming "the end" to come into view, alas, even that was denied. if beauty is in the eye of the beholder, then so is understanding; this movie had neither. yet there was a single redeeming feature as the closing credits began their run - an awesome view of a half dozen hot air balloons. apparently the film was keeping them afloat.

the story and the characters really really needed work. the world idea is kind of neat, but no one bothered to develop any of it either through exposition, or through the plot. despite the cheesy notes at the beginning of the film, it makes sense that you wouldn't use exposition, since no one is new to this world. and yet, when matt owens (bill paxton) and byron (bob peck) stray off-course and get lost, and get introduced to the wind-worshipers and the fat, lazy, rich people in the museum, we don't get any real idea of who these people are, or why we should care about any of them. smart films have ways of developing this simply by having the characters live in the world. simple things, like ordering a drink at a bar, or talking about something in the past -- these are the kind of things that make the film world memorable, not endless shots of crappy planes, and cheap cg effects of someone trying to do loops in an ultralight.if this is too difficult for you, here's a little tip -- pare down the multiple locations. if everything's becoming disjointed because you're pulling up to often, stay in one place for a little while and have the characters talk a little. all the superfluous crap should be removed. get rid of the entire wind-worshipers scene. get rid of the stuffy museum people. get rid of all the crappy flying crap unless you can make the wind relevant to the story. have the entire thing set on a big plane, or something. just get people talking about something we care about.hey, get rid of bill paxton. have the film center around tasker's character and his relationship with the robot, byron.indeed, the biggest problem of the film is that we don't care anything about anybody, because no one takes the time to either explain their motivations or delve into their characters. we don't like matt (well, because he's played by bill paxton, among other things). he's a scoundrel, who doesn't redeem himself enough, except to let the android, byron, go. and this action has even less meaning than most because of three key points: 1. byron is a murderer. 2. byron is indestructible 3. byron can leave any time he damn well pleases.we try to like byron, because there's a kind of pathos there, but it's largely undeveloped. all we're left with is a whiny, glassy-eyed robot guy who's acting is subdued and wooden one moment, and practically zany the next. we don't know why or how he develops emotions, but we do know for a fact that he's murdered someone. we don't know why he murdered someone, or the circumstances of this grisly event, because it isn't developed. we can't feel pity for him if we don't know the story. all we know for a fact is that he murders people. and he likes bill paxton.we don't hate tasker enough (partly because he's played by good-guy mark hamill), since while gruff and ruthless, doesn't do anything out of the ordinary for his character -- a post-apocalyptic peace officer. sure he kills montclaire (robbie coltrane) and his team, but they are drug dealers, on their way to grow poppies for heroin. and they shoot at him first. he doesn't kill anyone who doesn't get in the way, or who does not try to physically harm him first. that goes equally well for the final confrontation in the museum. he uses a smidge of police brutality against a lazy dilettante (f. murray abraham is wasted in this role), and everyone else draws a gun on him.i really don't understand what's the deal with belitski (kitty aldridge), tasker's partner. after only an accumulated 10 minutes with matt, she's ready to switch sides, despite her shouts of loyalty, and despite matt's trash-talking her, and punching her out. if that's love, then i'll choose hate any day.really. paxton's character is about as lovable as simon in "true lies", or pvt. hudson from "aliens". does anyone fall for him in these movies? no. why? because he's a loud-mouthed idiot, and a loser. why put him at the helm of this film?

this film fails on many many levels. the script is the first failing, and as i understand it, if the script stinks, there's nothing that can fix that. the plot is boring, after the first 45 minutes, i'm looking at the counter on the dvd saying to myself, "how much longer?" the cinematography is pretty awful. i'm not sure how bad the transfer was to dvd, but it looked like a vhs copy. also, the sound was bad. i realize this isn't going to get remixed for 5.1, but yikes, it didn't even sound like it was in dolby stereo which had been around for almost a decade when they cut this film.slipstream was far too similar to both mad max and blade runner for comfort. because of the lack of decent special effects and high quality dialog, it is extremely disappointing. if i recall, the pointer scene took place during the last 20 minutes, usually it should take place in the first 20. most people will be totally confused as to what the heck is going on until the final 20 minutes.the film's music was excellent in parts, and then completely inappropriate in others. elmer bernstien did the scoring, but it sounds like someone else had a hand in sticking in 'other' stuff elsewhere as it doesn't match the overall good orchestral score (with some synthesizer music.)there were great actors cast, bob peck, mark hamill, ben kingsley, bill paxton. and they did a great job breathing the little available life into their characters. (well, paxton's character was pretty stupid, and the whole movie was centered on him. i'm not sure a heroic stooge is a good choice for the main character who carries the film.) again, a major flaw with the script.thank goodness i watched this from a mail order dvd service, and not the theater. overall a major disappointment for sci-fi fans, or fans of paxton, or hamill. 90 minutes of your life, you'll never get back.

this movie was strange mainly because the plot was so incoherent. the title refers to a vicious wind which renders the surface of the earth almost uninhabitable when it blows, but this seemed to have nothing whatsoever to do with what was going on. the movie seems to be an extremely poor rip-off of bladerunner ie rogue android being chased by bounty hunter(or ruthless cop in this). luke skywalker turns in a surprisingly good performance as afore-mentioned rogue cop. nothing seems to be resolved at the end of the movie, we never find out anything of any substance about the android or what his intentions are. there is one baffling scene where bill paxton(who has kidnapped the android) plays one particular song in his cardboard airplane for no particular reason(the song is called "shape of things", by the yardbirds). this happens again in a later scene where the same song is played for no apparent reason. does this song have any relevance to the movie? don't think so.

if you are having trouble sleeping or just want to take that nap in the afternoon but just can't seem to drift off, pop in this movie. the only neat thing about this movie are the electric planes. aside from that prepare for some sweet zzzzz's. it boggles the mind how big name stars such as those in this movie can be part of the one of the dullest movies i've ever seen. now, if you will excuse me, i will finish my nap.

this is a movie with a wonderful concept, but very weak writing. it should never have been released with out at least three more re-writes (assuming it got any). the story is too loosly held together, and there are too many 90 degree turns in the story to make it a cohesive movie. it would be great to see what a decent screen-writer could do with the story.

they say david duchovny took six days to write the script for this movie. that sounds about right.this movie is one of the worst films i've ever seen and i've seen gigli. it's not as bad as gigli, but that's like saying saddam hussein wasn't as bad as adolf hitler.tom warshaw has been living in france with his french wife and 13-year old son. he has been pretending to be french all this time. he reveals to his wife that he is actually american. for some reason, this comes as an earth-shattering reveal for her, despite the fact that she always commented on her husband's american accent. also, their son - remember, he was born in france and never knew his father was american - speaks perfect american english without a hint of french accent. that's just one of several huge plot holes in this movie.the main bulk of the movie is a flashback to tommy's youth in new york city during the 1970's, as he explains to his wife why he has been hiding in france. his best friend as a boy was pappas, a retarded adult played terribly by robin williams. i assume duchovny thinks that "retarded" is someone who is just sort of dumb, because pappas comes off only mildly slow at times, while other times he comes off as just robin williams. yes, williams actually fits in his tired improv schtick although he is supposed to play a person who is mentally slow.tommy's mother, played by duchovny's wife tea leoni, is a pill-popping nurse who is distraught over the recent death of her husband. leoni does a good job, but she mainly just smokes a lot and yells at tommy for things that don't seem to be too important. the script didn't give her much to work with. tommy also befriends a lady (whom he calls "lady") who is in prison and offers him advice through her jail window (this house of detention is called "house of d" for short, thus the title). tommy has no qualms yelling his personal problems out loud on a city street so this incarcerated felon can offer him advice, and he does so many times without care.i don't want to bore you with the entire summary of the movie, but plot holes are abound in this film that tries way too hard to be touching but comes off as, well, bad. real bad. real real bad. near the end of this train wreck, the script gets cornier and cornier and ends with a laughably crappy ending.critics tore "house of d" apart and rightfully so. i can't believe some people actually like this movie. it is a painful film to sit through and i felt weak afterwards - not from emotion, but from how terrible it was.

an american boy goes to paris after his mother commits suicide, becomes and artist and then discovers himself and returns to the states so he can make things right with his former friends.i have to think that the people who are rating this movie so highly are all x-files fans, even though there are no aliens or serial killers in it. don't be fooled, this movie blows chunks.the story is incoherent, with little or no explanation of what people are doing or why. when you do get an explanation, it doesn't fit the story that went before it. what it does is bore you. for all the acting talent in the film, it just isn't interesting. i spent the whole movie wondering when sex-addict duchovny was going to bang someone. maybe he was doing it behind the scenes; they should have filmed that instead.what comes across is a story of a self-obsessed artist worrying about minor incidents in his life and wanting to make them right somehow - even though they didn't seem that wrong to begin with. there aren't any particularly interesting or shocking revelations, despite the mention of a big secret in the first few minutes. it's just a guy thinking that his life is as interesting to you as it is to him. it's not.i saw in the trivia that duchovny claims he wrote the script in a week, that's entirely believable. the guy can act, there's no doubt, but writing and directing are obviously beyond his talents.why hollywood keeps greenlighting these self-discovery stories is beyond me. i discover myself in the shower every morning but i don't bother making a movie about it. mine would probably be better than this one, though; at least there would be some nudity.

well, this movie wasn't as horrible as i thought it would be. i was expecting to give it one star. i chose to give it three. why? well, for a cheesy horror/sci-fi movie, it's not all that bad. sure the characters are tacky (as is their acting - including a young leonardo dicaprio), the effects cheap looking, and the monsters...well let's just say that i've seen some more effective halloween costumes in elementary schools... but there was something about this movie that made me watch it till the end. a little bit of humor helped out a bit i guess. and if you ever wanted to see an alien pass gas, this movie will let you live your dream. 3/10

i didn't particularly like sliding doors or twice upon a yesterday, so i certainly didn't this poor second-rate excuse for those films. an idea that's been done to death (what would happen if...?) and the script is shoddy and unsuccessful, not to mention the obvious attempt at adding sex/nudity simply to gain an r rating and certain scenes that just weren't necessary but were there to push the boundaries (i really don't need to see a kid urinating or a struggle with a diaphragm. especially when they have absolutely no connection to or use in the film).the acting was also very poor, the only actor i found the least bit satisfying was her daughter; the rest were two-dimensional and quite unbelievable. the people i watched this with left the room about halfway through; i managed to finish it, but not without fast forwarding through part of it.overall: nothing new here, it's a generic and boring film. the few rather amusing moments are far outweighed by the silly or stupid ones. this would be dull even if it hadn't been done before. if it weren't such a rehash i'd rate it a five, but even for an indie film this was severely lacking, and as a rehash it loses on originality as well: 3/10.

what a mess of a movie! if it wasnt for eric roberts and susan sarandon's performances ,this movie would be a total waste! a very muddled plot and phony dialogue.eric roberts debut....where did his career go from this movie on?nowhere but down!

when i heard the film was to be released and the theme of what it was about, i felt very curious. but when i saw it was the biggest deception of my life. technically speaking, the sound is poor, you can tell about man dialogs that were remade on studio that are poorly achieved in the final mix. secondo of all, the photography is mediocre, some part of the films show some soldiers with night vision goggles, and the way the cinematographer achieves that "dark night" is by illuminated everything like if they were in an actual military base with lights, there's no reference used of the moonlight, my god! thir but not least, most of the ac tings are really poor, it's totally not believable the roll of the wife of one of the soldier, her performance it's pretty poor.great disappointing, shame of the jury who chose to send this movie to represent colombia on the oscars.

tom is about to tuck into a delicious jerry sandwich when a huge bird of prey swoops down and flies off with his snack. not at all happy with having his sarnie stolen right from under his nose, tom takes off in hot pursuit, determined to retrieve his mousy morsel.as much as i love tom and jerry, i have got to say that this one is a bit of a stinker: the story is rather mundane; it introduces a badly conceived peripheral character that lacks charm; and it flogs the old 'dress the cartoon character up as a woman' gag to death.in my opinion, 'flirty birdy' rivals 'fraidy cat' and 'mouse in manhattan' for the title of weakest tom and jerry caper thus far.

this year's eurovision was to me a big disappointment. i've watched the eurovision song contest every year since 1986 (well, at least that's the earliest one i can remember, and i was only 2 at the time). as any other year this one contained both good, bad and horrible songs - nothing new there. however this year's show was the worst one i can remember. only very few good (decent's probably more like it) songs and a lot of absolutely terrible songs.turkey's winner song "every way that i can" sounded to me like a rip-off of turkish singer tarkan's hit "simarik", just sounding a lot worse. it didn't deserve to win from my point of view. belgium's song "sanomi", coming in second, was a no-language song. wonder what's next? animals singing? nevertheless the music for the song was quite catchy, giving the song a kind of dreamy feeling, to which the "lyrics" seemed appropriate. one of the better songs, but that's not saying much.after one of the closest races in eurovision history russian duo t.a.t.u. ended in third place just three points behind turkey and behind belgium, with "ne ver', ne boisia" ("don't trust, don't be afraid"). to me t.a.t.u. was one of the very few highlights of the show, surprising just about everyone by being some of the most covered up girls of all the female contestants. they let their song do the talking and if we ignore the fact that they failed to pitch a few times in the first chorus, they let the song speak very well indeed.the biggest surprise when looking at the scoreboard was austria. the bookmakers here in denmark had the biggest odds on that song - a song that indeed was beyond horrible - but ended up in 8th place. could it be that bum of his being shaken to the rhythm of the song? that performance was the one that made me and my family laugh the most, not because it looked good, but because it looked so stupid that it was actually fun.sweden did what they do the best; abba. in 1999 they won with "take me to your heaven", by sounding like abba. in 2001 they made the top 10 with "listen to your heartbeat", again sounding like abba, and once again this year they did it abba-style, again ending in the top 10.england was finally punished for making those absolutely horrible, non-catching songs, that they've been the past years.ireland ripped off the winner from 2000, "fly on the wings of love". and i could go on and on about how bad the songs were.i feel a bit sorry for the aussies, who this year finally got the chance to see the eurovision song contest. they deserved better than this.i wasn't surprised by the show though. the eurovision from 2000 to me stands out as one of the best in recent years. 2001 was quite good, but not as good. 2002 was okay, but certainly no more. this year was quite simply disappointing.let's hope it'll get better next year. if not for us, then at least for the aussies.4/10. one for t.a.t.u., one for the close race, one for the butt-shaking and one for all the rest.

the acting is generally pretty weak. the dialog was also apparently dubbed in after the filming, so it just doesn't come across well. what do you want for a tv movie?annette o'toole was ok; there were a few strong lines from the parent of the queen.otherwise, these kids weren't quite up to it. didn't impress my kids either.on the upside, it is only an hour long. considering that, it got through plot and character development in a creditable fashion. the settings and cinematography are ok too.some other viewers may like it for sentimental reasons.

i have recently gone to the movie theatres to see the new (2007) version of bridge to teribithia. after, i went to the library to rent the older version to see it again without paying again. i must say that i was extremely disappointed! i found the older version to have horrible acting as well as corny lines including jessie saying, "i know daddy, but i hurt so much inside" after leslie dies. it was quite horribly done and the casting was not much better in my opinion. i watched in amazement all the while saying no wonder they remade it. the story is great but trust me spend the money and see the new version, if you just see the old one you may never experience the true magic of teribithia.

i was in 6th grade and this movie aired on pbs during a series called 'wonderworks.' i distinctly remember sitting on a couch watching the movie with tears running down my face at the end. in the film jesse, the main character, forms an unusual friendship with a girl named leslie. due to a very simple, but careless mistake one of the pair dies. at the time, i found the story very powerful, because the fatal mistake is exactly the type of mistake a kid would make and so any kid watching the film will find it very easy to identify with and feel the emotional weight of the tragedy that ensues.last year, i finally tracked down a vhs copy of the show. i probably should have stuck with my memories. watching the show as an adult i was absolutely shocked by what a horribly made film this was. my girlfriend had a similar memory of the movie as well, and she too was pretty sad about how bad the movie was compared to her memories. many adults probably have a good memory of watching this movie when they were kids. i strongly advise that these people leave their memories intact, and avoid seeing this film as an adult.

i am a fifth grade language arts teacher, and after we read this book (which the students loved), then we watched the movie. they laughed out loud! unfortunately, it's not a comedy! the acting was so awful, i felt like i was watching a bunch of kids in the neighborhood putting on a play. my students were mimicking the lines and making fun off and on the whole way through. i have to agree with them, at times, it was pretty bad. still, i would show it to students again, just for fun, and to compare the film with the book. we did a venn diagram (teachers know what that is) afterward, to show what was the same in both and what were the differences, so there is an educational value in showing it. i noticed that another adaptation is being filmed for 2005 so we can only hope the acting will be better!

i have been collecting iron man comics since the early 70s and always enjoyed the character who is far far from the average clean cut hero and his many and varied enemies. there have been no less than three attempts at an animated series for iron man and only the original and part of the second have ever done the character justice. so i was somewhat hopeful that this newest version would be good. boy was i wrong! the dvd art is very misleading and presents an image that is not the movie. fist off the good, what little there is... the art and animation are well drawn and the writing and dialog are generally good, though with notable exceptions. character voices are very well selected and each character is distinctive and well acted. now for the bad... unfortunately the writers opted to totally screw around with both iron man's origin and especially the mandarin's. on top of that they decided to do iron man and his opponents all in cgi. bad cgi. this makes them stand out almost as badly as live actors would in a cartoon. the cg work is often repetitive and glaring shortcuts are taken at times. the cg battles are clumsy as well, further enhancing the fact that cg and line animation do not mix well. the movie would certainly have fared better had they opted to actually draw all the characters. another problem is that iron man is in his traditional red and gold suit for all of one battle! and its not even the big fight at the end. all this drags the movie down and it never picks up.************ spoilers (or warnings) may follow ************the movie starts off with an interestingly unusual stop motion credit sequence of machinery, welding and gears. then we are introduced to what looks like a chinese temple in the process of being restored, and prominent is a statue of what fans will recognize as the mandarin. things go strangely, impeding progress in restoring the temple. overseeing it is james rhodes, tony stark's long time friend. seems they plan to actually raise the temple up from the earth, despite opposition by a group who insist that raising the temple will bring about a terrible disaster. rhodes is captured in a raid. stark, shown in a hot tub with a lovely lady, is informed of the problems and sets out to personally oversee the project and rescue his friend while in the background his father deals with board executives who are pushing to have tony removed. tony arrives only to have his armored escort ambushed and blown to pieces. tony later awakens mortally wounded in the heart and a prisoner of the rebels. he is saved only by quick action from rhodes and a scientist. eventually stark must build the prototype gray iron armor and makes good an escape, but only after some loss of life. while with the rebels he meets a troubled girl named li mei, and the two fall in love. the temple is raised and four elemental beings (all done in cg) appear and proceed to start collecting hidden rings of power. stark and rhody find trouble back home but manage to confront the elementals without success in really stopping them, first using the aquatic armor, then the more classic red and gold armor and finally everything returns to the temple and stark is back in the bulky gray armor for a final showdown and a run in with what may be fin fang foom (also in cg.) here the story takes a major twist as it turns out that the mandarin needs a host body to manifest. this leads to a somewhat tragic final battle marred by the fact that the mandarin is little more than a ghost and isn't seen till the last 5 minutes of the movie. ugh...if you are an iron man fan then you will likely not enjoy this outing. and even non-fans may well find the movie somewhat lacking or not.

this was something i had been looking forward to seeing. the ultimate avengers movies had both exceeded my expectations and since iron man has been one of my favorite marvel characters i thought that this same production team would be able to do some really great stuff with an iron man solo title. but the final film was unsatisfying. i wasn't expecting them to spend most of the movie paying tribute to iron man gray armor. the red and gold armor is seen for maybe ten or so minutes all together. not a major complaint but not what i expected from the ads and box. the worse thing however was the story, the acting and the cell-shaded cgi animation for the monsters and iron man armor that was not convincing. it didn't blend in well with the cell animation at all. even on it's own it seem stick-like and lifeless. tony stark's character arc, as incredibly slow as it takes, is so forced and unconvincing. i wanted to see this movie because i love iron man but after forcing myself through the film i wondered if they couldn't have come up with something that had been as good as the ultimate avengers movies.

i am obviously disappointed so i'll be brief and won't waste your time. first off, the plot was uninspired... at least. the animation was even worse, we're in 2008 for god's sake and it looked like a shinier version of g.i.joe. i won't even bother characterizing the actors' performance and the dialogs. or maybe i will 'cause i just saw that in order to post a comment over here you need 10 lines (?!??!?!). where were we? oh yeah the performance, well it was totally flat, lacking passion and talent if i am excused. now as for the dialogs, just like the acting, no memorable quotes, nothing that someone wouldn't expect. let's just hope the movie will be decent ...at least.

don't get me wrong, the guy's a success dynamo, but he got to the top by selling overpriced plastic toys to impulsive brats. so i get a little peeved when he looks at comic book fans as an extension of that same market.see, "the invincible iron man" wouldn't be bad if it were slotted on a saturday morning and geared exclusively toward undiscerning children. but it's not directed exclusively at children. periphery characters are killed every five minutes and there's enough bloodshed and semi-nude bodies to make network censors squirm, so it isn't quite cut out for children's television.so what audience is this video aiming for then? it's the audience that enjoys nigh intelligible story lines about reviving a tyrannical chinese emperor with 5 arcane rings, that's who. and i think that audience is restrictively small.a lot of great writers have passed through marvel's leathery yoni over the decades. so it's a shame that marvel would risk their pricey animation investments on so many questionable storytellers and scribes who, like mr. arad, are better accustomed to peddling action figures during saturday morning cartoons. how many lukewarm receptions do marvel have to endure before they come up with a better strategy? ***animation: just passable cels, some segments are better than others, a low budget look all throughout -- this ain't no bakshi (ralph) and it ain't no bluth (don)! cg animation's okay, but far from impressive.story: a litany of clichés, all over the place, convoluted, contrived, and uninspired.characters: so why is rhodes even here if all he does is add to stark's sexual ambiguity? hmmm... her dad's in a wheelchair... tony misses his mom... asian chicks are hot and, apparently, little else; the female lead is thoroughly objectified by the feature's end.performances: can't blame competent voice actors for a bad script.art: very western musculature, very clean lines, faces are very derivative of eastern art, very boring mattes, very bland cg.conclusion: not great, but worth a watch for the fans and those who enjoy superhero myths. a 'must-buy' for collectors. a valuable "what not to do" course for junior animators.

first of all, the title "daily" is a lie. every "daily show" program opens with an on-screen visual of the date it was made, followed by a pause and the opening announce. on the many days when they are re-running a daily show, they slip-cue the tape and omit the date and begin with the opening announce giving the false impression that the show is a new one. that's a lie. there is no mention of it being a rebroadcast. and that kind of crap is just a small indicator of how sneaky and deceptive this show is. furthermore, it's only on 4 nights a week. that's not quite "daily" - meaning monday through friday - another shortcoming but one i am grateful for.it's sad to think that many clueless young people use this fake news program as their main, often only, news source. this leaves them woefully ignorant and much worse - badly misinformed.although it leans liberal-left, politically, this show can be amusing at times. however, its veracity is low. facts and information are often cleverly twisted to fit the writers' agendas. it's often hard to tell where the facts leave off and the fiction and comedy writing begin. the result is pre-digested, reinterpreted information designed to persuade and influence. this is called "propaganda".the remote interviews are heavily kluged in editing.it really loses me when it bashes god and christians - which it does all too often. however, you'll never hear anything vaguely anti-semitic.if jon stewart and company attacked anyone but christians, it would be considered an offensive outrage. the names in the credits explain the source.

jon stewart (aka john liebowitz) constantly rips conservatism and anything republican. this liberal comic is anything but, as he pours his cutting "humor" down the throats of impressionable youths. i've viewed the show while stuck in a waiting room while my car was repaired and this guy borders on treason. he'll take al queda's side over bush any day. he's shameless and everything he says is punctuated by a phony laughtrack. i do remember four years ago when he "interviewed" john kerry. the two made faces at each other that seemed to preclude a makeout session. it was like, "get a room, you guys". i just don't like smirky little traitors who peddle their propaganda. call me shallow. the daily show has had a long run and there are many likeminded liberals who have a seething hatred for republicans and conservatism. i'm not surprised at its success, but do that many people actually watch comedy central? that mancia guy makes me barf.

comedy works best when it relates to stuff that's true. but even as such, some effort is required to make jokes that everyone likes and even the most grumpy of viewers can crack a smile. when i look at the daily show, i see the whole "it's funny because it's true" thing, but i don't, however, see the effort and often times i don't if they're being funny or just trying to make a point(i notice this mostly in the interview segments). the daily show started off as a news parody, by definition they poke fun at how the media plays it's own news by pretending to be inept and dumb news reporters and anchormen and they tackled tons of subjects from science to movies and sometimes politics, then jon stewart came along...and it all went to hell. thr first years of jon stewart's reign were arguably golden, i though he was so funny, but then 2004 came along and it's where you start to notice a huge chance in the show from there on. the show's humor has gone stale, colbert left, steve carell left, many of the show's best anchors left and now it's mostly about jon stewart and the show's gone from a parody to a semi-serious news show, essentially evening news but with some gags here and there. for those who haven't seen the show and are having trouble finding out what to watch on cable, i'll give you a brief description of what the show's about(at least until 2009): -bush, cheney and all republicans(unless they happen to embrace an opinion shared by democrats as well) are stupid, evil, corrupt and hypocrites, anyone who stands by conservative beliefs is also evil, corrupt and a hypocrite; -people who doubt the man-made global warming theory are evil and stupid; -vote democrat; there, i saved you 25 minutes of your time, go watch something else. at first, i though that the producers hijacked the show for their own personal political agenda, but when i actually see the interviews, it becomes crystal clear what this show's about(what i mentioned above), but i'll get to that in a moment. frist off, the humor in the daily show according to jon stewart expects you to find a random filmed quote said by either bush, cheney or a random republican humorous because well, because. jon sets up the joke, setting it in writers specific context and expects that the random quote somehow delivers the punchline. so, unless you «get» the context, it's entirely useless as bankable humor. also the daily show expects you to laugh when they show a montage of one politician talking and in another separate video saying another thing, again putting into a context that the writers expect you to understand, thus making it funny,why? well, because jon said so. now imagine the daily show using that formula countless times for years every week, and you'll start to understand of what used to be a laugh-fest that is now 25 minutes of just silent stares(yes, even in the lewis black segments). at first, some decent amount of effort was put into these jokes, but now much less of that is apparent. and the interview have the most odd sense of bias that i've ever seen. jon stewart calls bill o'reilly a bully, but what does that make him, when he sucks up to every single actor and democrat(john kerry before, obama today) that appears on the show and looks down upon respected republicans and accomplished conservative newsmen such as weekly standard's own bill kristol? he puts them in some sort of people's tribunal as if they're being charged with a crime, often times any person on the show who stands up for bush is portrayed as delusional, as if that person's out of touch with reality and assumes he speaks for the majority of america, that's the de facto treatment for anybody conservative, unless they happen to share a similar point of view with democrats, if so then's it's an endless love fest. but still, it doesn't matter, in the eyes of jon you are already wrong before you walked into the show and are still wrong afterwords. that's the kind of treatment you get if you are anything remotely right-wing. now you have to wonder what that could possibly have anything to do with humor. one wonders what'll happen if democrats win the white house...

i have tried watching this show on several different occasions and each time found it to be utterly pale of humor.the reason, to mention one thing, is that it is solely based on ridiculing anything the republicans have done. in short it is basically democratic party political opinions touted as humor.all mr. stewart does is wisecrack about anything the republicans have done and the audience wets themselves in gales of forced laughter.my guess is that the left is so devoid of any real substance that they have to define themselves in terms of how much they all hate republicans.-ld_____________________________my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/

this show has shown it's true colors now that democrats are in power. it never did lead the world in iq as anyone who thought it has intelligence has been programmed to think one way (which is a scary thing).comedy central moved this & it's spin off back to an earlier time once the democrats took power for a reason- because now when the democrats screw up - which is just as often as republicans do - stewart no longer takes pot shots at them. that is why the ratings for both this & the spin are dropping.basically, most of the humor now is either lame, or lame sarah palin jokes - which all the ratings dropping comedians are now telling. the facts to back this up speak for themselves. the jay leno show which has been doing the same kind of humor is on the verge of being canceled. the ratings for letterman & conan & the shows that follow them are down.so emperor stewart is not alone. trouble is if any of them start taking real rips at the bungling democrats in power, they could raise their ratings in a hurry because the best humor is always at the expense of whose in power. the bush years proved that because the ratings for this show & colbert, & letterman & leno were higher there.o'bama has done one thing, proved these shows have to be willing to take chances & rip the folks in power if they are to prosper. right now, the daily show & stewart are sagging but maybe they can get lucky & have palin elected as the first woman president in 2012. then the lame palin jokes will become ratings grabbers.

for some reason i just didn't like it at all and felt embarrassed about how bad it was since i bought it and watched it with my family. all of us hated it with a passion. it's a nice enough kids' movie, maybe in the year it came out. however, think about it: an outdated kids' movie? what's the point? kids do not generally like to watch such old movies anyway, and i don't see what adults are supposed to get out of this movie at all.some kids' movies (like mary poppins or wizard of oz) can be enjoyed even now, but time bandits is totally outdated. for your reference, and i think applicable in this case, i also did not like dr strangelove or spinal tap at all. so, if you disagree with me on those similarly outdated movies, you might like time bandits.there is also a horrible case of overacting as i recall from the 'bad guys'. think of the two stupid 'bad pirates' in the pirates of the c. movies, except in time bandits they are not even remotely funny.anyway, i warned you, that's all i can do. people that rate this movie high must have liked it from many years ago. if you have not seen it before, then don't bother watching it now.

i got this movie from the library, and saw it had a lot of actors i like in it(john cleese, ian holm, ralph richardson, etc), so i got it and watched it. i expected cleese to have a large role since he had first billing, i was surprised to find out that he had about five minutes of screen time, along with everyone else i liked. this movie is amazingly pointless, the characters are nobodies, the plot is non-existent, and the ending is one of the worst endings i have ever seen. there were a few funny parts, but that's about it. stay away from this movie if you want to prevent going "what?" and "huh?", a lot. and if you don't want to waste your time. ignore the people who say this is a very funny movie...it isn't. just stay away from it at all costs...please.

i know terry gilliam is considered as a good director but claiming that this movie is good is just foolish. what was the movie about? what is it a spoof? fantasy? comedy? satire? no answer there from gilliam's screenplay. totally confused and pointlessly hurtling from one historical age to another. i find it amusing that some people actually call this movie magical. is it because they have to praise any movie which is vague and indecisive on what it is about?? 3 stars for special effects considering it is 1981. roger ebert has it right in his review. the movie is ambiguous and looks like gilliam's romp with money just to make a vague children's move masquerading as a historical revue. the movie also tries to confuse the would-be viewer by giving john cleese and sean connery top billing.

i have seen this movie and in all honestly was quite disappointed. and in my opinion this movie lacks heart. i frankly didn't care what happen to the characters by the end of the movie. there was so much there they could have done with the movie that they didn't because they were either so rapped up in trying to be obscure and make some deep comment on life, or trying so hard not to, that the characters and story were completely lost in all of it. i have seen another picture by this director and enjoyed it well enough. but i felt this film lack of the whimsy and heart of the other and i was left wondering what the point was, or if the point of the movie was that it had no point. honestly, while i didn't feel like tearing my hair out during the movie, i did remorse the lost time on the sad little film.i have no doubt that some people will love this movie, but frankly i didn't.

well.....horror this ain't, but.......!!!??? a terrible low low budget backwood-flic of the worst kind, sort of and...therefore quite charming and funny to watch...at least on my tv set!!! a cross between pete walker, herschell gordon lewis and...say....damn, i give up...just can't come up with any "prettier" resemblances for this trashy movie. everything is soooo wrong that i just have to enlist it in my film collection alongside with....death in venice.....nekromantik.....blue velvet and the good,bad,ugly... right !!?? people with some small talent for adding gory inserts or sexy happenings to film they buy offa other people, should pick this film up immediately....sure is a fat lil' ol' goldmine waiting here, oh maaaannnn!!!!!

i went into this film expecting/hoping for a sleazy drive-in style slice of seventies exploitation, but what i got was more of a bizarre pseudo western with far too much talking and not enough action. it's clear that this film was made on a budget; the locations are drab and poorly shot, while the acting leaves a lot to be desired also. the plot focuses on a trio of robbers (a father and two sons) that steal a load of gold after killing some miners. they come across a cabin inhabited by a young girl and her stepmother...and all this is told in flashbacks by the young girl, currently residing in an asylum. it's clear that directors louis leahman and william sachs thought they were making something really shocking; but despite its best efforts, south of hell mountain is just too boring to shock the viewer. the film drones on for about eighty minutes and most of it consists of boring characters spouting off boring and long-winded dialogue. the only good thing i have to say about the film is with regards to the music; which is good in places. the ending is the only other good thing about the movie; and that's only because it's the last thing that happens. i wouldn't recommend anyone bothers tracking this down...there was much better trash made in the seventies.

an absolutely baffling western featuring flash-forward sequences set in an insane asylum, south of hell mountain was one of the first films produced by the schlockmeisters at cannon film. co-directed by william sachs, who would later deliver such fan favourites as the incredible melting man and galaxina, the film tells the very dull tale of a trio of gold robbers who stumble upon a cabin occupied by two women who are hiding some secrets that aren't worth discovering. the cast (most of whom never made another film) try gamely, but are hamstrung by the screenplay, which generally makes no sense. the asylum scenes are edited in to little effect and are punctuated by ridiculous sound effects and tape loops. ultimately, it's a lot of talk and little else.

maybe it is unfair for me to review this movie because i walked out well before the end. that's odd, because i usually like shakespeare on the screen and i enjoyed midsummers night's dream once, many years ago, when i saw it on the stage. i think that two things did me in: that squeaky twerp with the shakespearian name, calista flockhart, and michelle feiffer sitting in a giant clamshell. well, i suppose you could say it supposed to be a comedy -- but when the scenery is funny and the actors aren't, i'd say we have a bad movie on our hands....

maybe it was the excessive weight gain seagal had put on. or maybe it was the horrible acting of wayans in an action flick. or was it the total lack of chemistry between the two leading characters? these and other considerations lead me to conclude that seagal should have never made this acting nightmare. true, the story line was good. yet, as an avid follower of seagal's career and background, his physical appearance was inconsistent with his genre of clean, pure, healthy zen buddhist living, notably in his on screen discussions with wayans. (then again his real life affair with the "nanny" was inconsistent also!)if seagal wants to become a more diversified actor, then he should do what a fellow action figure did in "kindergarten cop"...put humorous material or situations in the script where the actor has no choice but to react in a comical way. otherwise, leave the wise-cracks and the futile attempts at humor out of it while chasing a serial killer. seagal is not a natural humor type of guy. it did not work.

kennan ivory wayans was so funny in low down dirty shame that i had to see this one and it was one of the worst he has done and steven seagal didn't help much. it starts off with some odd religious killings that don't make much sense to jim campbell (keenan). he is surprised to see a new partner waiting for him to work by his side to crack the case but jack cole doesn't seem to be who everyone thinks he is until jack's ex wife is killed in one of those ritual killings that end up making him the suspect as well. it's the same thing as all of his other movies: smoke past, cia involvement and now trying to be a normal cop. why does steven dress up like he is from a western movie? and the prayer beeds on top of that make things a little confusing.

typical steven seagal fare: that is, it's crap. the plot relies on a series of incredibly improbable coincidences; there's a hefty dose of conspiracy theory which would be much more palatable if we didn't know that seagal takes it all literally; and once again, bad-movie multi-millionaire seagal tells us all about the evils of the rich.seagal's survival relies, as usual, on the fact that bad guys never fire their guns from out of arm's reach, and always like to give a little "i'm gonna kill you" speech before blowing a man's head off.watch this one right after the even-worse *fire down below* and note how the carpet in keenen ivory wayans's apartment is more flammable than a big puddle of gasoline.oh, and watch in the final fight scene for the incredible disappearing forehead wound, which is probably the most entertaining thing in the film.

imagine if you will an alternative universe where someone has made seven where instead of a talented cast and crew they've cast a politically conscious environmentalist and a stand up comedian as the leads . if your imagination can't stretch that far just watch the glimmer man as it's the next worse thing !!!! mild spoilers !!!!jack cole is a cop with a hidden past and it's very ironic that he's played by steven seagal since he's also someone witrh a hidden past , but don't tell anyone because it's top secret . perhaps the biggest secret is how someone like seagal became a movie star in the first place since the glimmer man continues in the vein of all of seagal's other movies in that it's utter , utter crap . look at the way he's introduced as his partner walks into his office " yoi love beads man . in you're in the wrong office " steven replies with something that is side splittingly witty , or he would if anyone was able to understand a bloody word he said because for much of the movie he just mumbles away . in fact the only time i could make out his dialogue was the scene at the school where he bursts in on the gunman holding the class hostage " don't make me kill you " is this what a cop would say to a suicidal gunman ? i'm just thinking that in another movie where steven isn't the hero ( ie a good movie ) the cop would say something along the lines of " don't kill me , i've got a wife and a couple of kids waiting at home " . so anyway suicidal gunman goes to blow his head off but steven saves his life by hurtling them both through two sets of windows . it goes without saying that you shouldn't try this at homeas the story progresses steven ( i've given up on calling him jack though credit to the screen writer for giving steven a sensible name ) becomes involved in a case a plagiarism where someone has been stealing bits out of other superior movies featuring serial killers . as steven finds more victims you can see him thinking " what was that movie that starred morgan freeman as a cop ? " as he inspects the bodies , oh and the action keeps switching back to the hero's domestic life just so we know that this guy's good as a family man , this guy's very good as a family man such a pity he's so bad as a movie star

a not so good action thriller because it unsuccessfully trends the same water as early steven seagal films because there is not a very good set piece. steven seagal plays the same kind of character that he has played since above the law. in my opinion the performance of keenen ivory wayans is wasted in such an average film and belongs in a much better film. bob gunton is okay as the main heavy. the best acting in the entire film belongs to brian cox who is very frightening in the role of the murderer. my favorite scenes are the fight scenes with the russian mafia. one of the film reasons to see the glimmer man(1996) is for the brief appearence of the beautiful and voluptupus nikki cox. its too bad that there were not more scenes with her in them.

i am speechless, honestly i cannot understand how anyone could have conceded to a script like this, cast anyone in the film let alone direct it. the fact that i am writing this review feels like an insult to my fingers, this film should be thrown in to the dustbin rather than be reviewed. i am disappointed in flex alexander for even thinking about accepting such a poor excuse for a script let alone essay the role. omg! i think i just insulted the word "essay"...uh yeah i did. y'know what, the less said about this mindless drivel, the better. you have been warned, nobody warned me i had to experience the horror myself. watch at your own risk.

the main word that comes to mind when considering this film is "dodgy". this is a low-quality film biography of one of the most iconic performers of all time. the gloved one deserved better.before getting into the meat of my thoughts on this biopic, i have to say that there are two things i found effective. first was the use of actual fan footage and interviews at certain points in the film, especially in the scenes depicting the first set of child molestation allegations. i feel that this contributed a certain authenticity that was *severely* lacking throughout the rest of the film. second was the sequence depicting the courtship of michael jackson and lisa marie presley. i will not comment on whether i believe the marriage was a sham, but by many accounts, it was a relationship where care and affection existed between the two parties involved. that really came across in this film; flex anderson and krista rae had decent enough chemistry to pull it off. these successful points are enough to keep man in the mirror away from 1-star status.that said...there was very little else here that worked. very few of the actors looked like the people they were supposed to portray, most egregiously those playing elizabeth taylor, janet jackson, and diana ross. also, the absence of jackson's music was a huge loss. how can you effectively tell a story about him without his music?? i understand that they were unable to secure the rights to it with this being a low-budget, unauthorized production; it seems, though, that if you can't have the man's music in a film about him, you might as well pack it up and go home, because you're missing out on an extremely important part of his life story.this film's characterization of jackson bothered me a little, too. i won't argue that he was troubled and may have been a few fries short of a value meal, but here, he was portrayed as something close to mentally disabled. i don't believe that jackson, known to have been a shrewd businessman, would have been quite as naive about how the adult world works as he was made out to be in this film.finally, the way this film was written was nothing short of disgraceful. many lines or exchanges of dialogue were either extremely corny, like michael and janet's "tinkerbell" exchange, or nonsensical, like the "blanket of love" comments made by michael. also, the screenwriters don't exactly have a knack for subtlety. there was a lot of telegraphing of upcoming events ("what could possibly go wrong??" sorts of lines) and extremely overt hammering of themes and motifs in the film (if i'd heard the word "believe" one more time...). this is what ultimately hobbled the film as something that could be considered awesomely bad.perhaps when we are a few years, or even a decade or three, removed from jackson's death, someone will be able to bring his story to life in a more deserving film. by that time, we might have a better perspective on his life, and someone will be able to present a truly thoughtful examination of who michael jackson really was and what he's meant to the world of entertainment. this very dodgy biopic was not that film.

usually when a television biopic is released on a celebrity, its, at the very least, campy (i.e. cybill shepherd as martha stewart, lauren bacall as doris duke), this is the most horrendous, cheap, and boring television movie ever made. if vh-1 is going to make a television film, they have got to spend a little more money on them. flex alexander--though gifted with the michael voice--is not a great dancer, does not resemble michael one bit, and does not even have his mannerisms down. vh-1 would have done better by hiring an actual impersonator, that way when see michael go into get plastic surgery, he doesn't actually come out looking exactly the same. why should we be taken aback at the shrinking of michael's nose when its exactly the same size as in the beginning of the film? the woman playing elizabeth taylor cannot act and looks nothing like her, and don't even get me started on the woman as janet jackson. terrible script and a severe case of miscasting needs to keep vh-1 from producing any more movies. flex alexander would have made a much better jermaine jackson rather than michael. costumes? trashy ripoffs. neverland? spliced together footage from news docs. don't bother with this one....its not even remotely worth it. the one good piece of casting--the actor portraying joseph jackson and maybe the actress as lisa marie presley, though she should have been more tomboy than girlie girl.

i grabbed la bandara because it reunited jean gabin and julien duvivier, whose pepe le moko is a noir masterpiece. i'll give it a few points because gabin is in it, but the clumsy plot, cheap sets and the ludicrous annabella making like an arab princess put the film on my `to sell' shelf. if you watch it, you'll find yourself asking, why didn't the idiots build the fort *around* the well, instead of a deadly few yards away from it. and why use tin roofs in the middle of the desert? but by then the sheer perversity of contrivance that makes up the script should numb you to any further contemplation.

not many people outside poland have had an opportunity to become familiar with andrzej sapkowski's brilliant writings. he's very popular in poland for his fantasy short stories ( i believe none of them has ever been translated intrto english. alas!). to make a long story short, wiedzmin - the main character of sapkowski's books - is a traveling monster slayer, a man of extraordinary strenght and skill: he's pretty much your favourite tolkien-style cool guy. unfortunately, no one would figure this out after watching the film. 'wiedzmin' the movie is nothing but a collection of random scenes, featuring wiedzmin and other characters from sapkowski's writings, but not eben remotely resembling the plot and dramatic pace of the original. event the fact that some of the shots in the film show attractive naked women does not add any quality to it. the movie gets worse and worse with every minute, and does not even meet the requirements of 'so bad it's actually good' category. if you really are into fantasdy and want to learn something about wiedzmin, read the books instead.

yes, that's true. that movie is a horrible piece of... you know what. almost all fans of sapkowski's books in poland think the same. the truth is that polish cinematography can not afford producing fantasy films. it's a shame when you compare "wiedzmin" and "conan the barbarian" for example. i hope no one outside poland will ever see this nightmare.

a very mediocre film based on a superb series of stories and novels. i hope somebody, someday will be able to film it the right way. in the meantime, look for the books (by a. sapkowski), a very inteligent, postmodern fantasy. by now there should be a translation in english, there translations in german for sure.

there are three main problems with the film. or rather there are three reasons why it isn't even a contender worthy of more serious consideration.firstly, and this was always going to be true, it's not nearly as good as the books. however, at least we could have expected to reflect some of the sapkowski's wit or depth.secondly we have the production. fantasy movies are, in my opinion, the hardest to produce well. everything from the props through costumes, scenery, stunts and (especially) cgi is substandard.finally, and this is many be very subjective, i just can't quite take the acting seriously. i wasn't brought up in poland so i can't really judge- it may me my lack of familiarity with films in polish. all the same the lines seem very amateurishly delivered... the casting could be better as well.in summation, the only possible redeeming feature of this film is the remainder of the plot shining through: not unlike a diamond ring on a rotting cadaver.on a separate note i heard that the books are coming out in english. i haven't seen them yet but i can't imagine how one would even begin to translate them... i would ask the english-speaking reader to bare this in mind when judging the book.

brodzki's creation is a great example of how not to make a movie. first there was a book written with a great humor. book that has numerous fans who would be happy to supply help when producers for some reasons decided to employ people who hardly heard of the book in the first place. then came a script as humorless and full of nonsense as possible. at the same time the script was written in a way to allow only those who actually had read the books to understand anything of the plot. not that anything in this movie made much sense anyway(ex. "i'm like an ice shard. you can burn yourself" said yennefer as a word of warning - warning that logic is something this movie seriously lacks). to add to that we have to mention that no matter the amount of money that was supposedly spent on the movie everything looks like an amateur production with two (2) computer effects one of which is a see-through dragon. even the costumes look as if the were borrowed from a really poor theater. that is the better ones look this way. and to add to that we have a few 'naked scenes' put there only so they will be in the film because they have no explanation in what one may mercifully call plot. the movie has only one strength that can hardly make up for the rest - music is not bad. though if i was to choose i'd prefer to have it separately. it sounds better if you don't have to look at this failure of super production.

the movie is simply horrible (2/10). although actors are trying their best (well sometimes that isn't much) special effects are ...let me put it this way it would be better if there weren't any.the script is based on sapkowski's prose, so it should be the biggest advantage of this movie. sadly it's the opposite. there is nothing left of the original atmosphere. and it's all very chaotic. maybe they just had too much material to show in 2h time.anyway if you would like to see this film i would recommend you to look for the tv series (same title, same actors, even the plot stays the same) that was made in the same time the movie did. it is so much better (9/10) and the story there actually make sense:)

well, for a start, i must say that, here, in russia, a saga of geralt of rivia is known and loved. andrzej sapkowski - a gifted writer, or, maybe, even genius of some sort - created one of the most realistic, honest, cynical and god d@mn well written fantasy worlds in a history of literature. and when such amazing material gets in a right hands well, see rpg game "witcher" and you will understand what i am talking about."vedmak\wiedzmin" is an excellent example of the opposite outcome.lack of budget. lack of directing. lack of good script.these three whales of disgusting movie making sunken this movie, ate it alive. acting is good, sometimes even more than good but for god sake it can not save this project. i still have some faith though. i still hope that someday a new vedmak movies will be created and entire world will see magnitude and breathtaking splendor of sapkowski's books. p.s. but before that a uwe boll must be eliminated. just in case, you know

when just days away before the film's premiere, its screenwriter backs out of the project, and demands his name to be removed from the credits, you know that this does not bode well. the books, on which "wiedzmin" is based on, have great potential for a vivacious fantasy film  "geralt de rivia is a witcher; his sole purpose is to destroy the monsters that plague the world. but not everything monstrous-looking is evil, and not everything fair is good" but all that didn't matter, when a polish film crew, with a low budget, and no, or little appreciation for sapkowski's work, decided to make a 13-part mini-series out of it. the two-hour film is a by-product of their actions, to maximize the profits. it's not hard to point out in this case, what makes people label this film as bad. plot (incoherent, thanks to cramming it with too many stories), acting (below average, with exception of zebrowski), dialogues (bland), editing (choppy), special effects (unbearable) and choreography (poor), add up to the film's overall bad experience. only the soundtrack, done by grzegorz ciechowski, brings out the beauty of the world of "wiedzmin", which was never brought to the screen. even poland's grandiose flora and fauna (where part of "the chronicles of narnia: the lion, the witch and the wardrobe" was shot), a crucial element in almost any fantasy film, were not used up to their full potential. the more i think about this dead loss, the more i'm running out of words. at least, it's a comfort to know, that marek brodzki, the director of "wiedzmin", has directed only one film ever since (in addition, in germany). for now, we're left with top-notch fantasy stories and a fantastic computer rpg (released in 2007) referring to the wiedzmin books. but i'm sure that one day, justice will be done for the wiedzmin saga, and we'll be treated with an equally good film adaptation soon enough.

this movie is trash from the word go. first, it gives an account of a season that took place 16 years ago! who cares? this movie had about as much depth as a bottle cap. it makes a complex person like bob knight into a cartoon character.swearing doesn't bother me, but i'm still amazed that espn showed a movie with more cursing than a kevin smith movie on a basic cable channel. the f-word was dropped at least 20 times before the first commercial break.this movie was terrible and anyone associated with it should be embarrassed. i rate this on the same level as jaws iv - the revenge and everybody wins...2 movies that are in the crapfest hall of fame.

this movie probably seemed like a great idea in pre-production. "let's make a movie about one of the greatest and most controversial athletic coaches of the modern era! and let's cast brian dennehey as coach bobby knight!" that's where this movie went terribly wrong. why cast an actor who bears no semblance of the man he's portraying? and then, why let this actor turn his character into not coach knight, but brian dennehey in a red sweater? as i sat watching this movie on espn, i didn't find myself believing this man was actually coach knight. he didn't look like him, talk like him, act like him, or even walk like him. i could not get past this fact, and thusly, i could not enjoy the movie. when paul newman and robert redford were cast as the outlaws butch cassidy and the sundance kid, we didn't care if they were accurate historical models of their true characters because most of us had never even heard of these men until we saw the movie. but, with someone as visible in today's media as coach knight, you have to do better. when anthony hopkins was cast as nixon, it was the same situation. but, anthony hopkins made us believe he in fact was nixon. dennehey didn't even try. what might have been a great movie was turned sour by this. besides the fact that this movie tried to do for the four-letter word what "saving private ryan" did for dismemberment, it stunk. too little of the real coach knight and too much profanity for the sake of shock value turned this movie into a "season to turn off half-way through the broadcast." the only good thing about this is that it was television movie. i didn't have to waste my hard-earned money on this piece of trash.

i watched this with great trepidation, and my trepidation was well founded, it seems. what was this movie about? knight? the season? the players? what? it was all over the place all the time. it had no tension (sorry, we all knew bobby was going to curse and throw things) but brian denehy, a fine actor, comes across as mailing in the anger and delivering zero tension. cheaply shot, like a macgiver episode. contrast this thanksgiving main course with the job hbo did on the don king movie "only in america" to show how to do sports biopics, warts and all. notice that espn promoted the hell out of it and then never showed it again?

its obvious espn drools whenever knight is in the news, but did they have to make a freakin' movie about him? this was the worst attempt at a serious dramatic movie i have ever seen. it had it all: terrible acting, terrible dialogue, ridiculous casting, cheap sets, etc etc. it looked like it was shot on a $10 budget. cummon, whats up with the game scenes? were they in a middle school gym? and the lighting, well, let me just say it was ridiculous. and brian denehy as bob knight? give me a break. denehey looked like...denehy in a red sweater, nothing more. espn lost a lot of credibility with this flop attempt. they poured millions of $$$ in advertising, then the premier was a huge dissapointment. bob knight is not a subject that can be covered in a 2-hour movie. espn blew it. even knight himself thought it was more stupid than anything else.

"season on the brink" is one of my favorite books of all time - an insightful unflinching look at bob knight and his indiana hoosiers. and dennehy is one of my favorite supporting actors of all time. so i made a point of watching this adaptation.it disappointed on every level. dennehy's performance was less than inspired, and he seemed unprepared to play knight - like he had accepted the role just prior to filming. the rest of the cast isn't much better.and it was obvious that this was espn's first movie. it was poorly directed, poorly filmed, and the lack of budget was obvious anytime games were being simulated (smaller gyms, empty seats, etc.) skip this adaptation and read the book - it holds up well to this day!

despite the famous cast this animated version of dickens tale is the borest i've seen. enough that i zapped away in he first commercial break. the characters didn't appeal to me at all and the animation is looking cheap.i'll give this movie a very low rating. give me the disney version anytime.

why wasn't this voted for best picture of 1998? this has to be the best movie ever. it makes something like citzen kane look like utter crap, come on, citzen kane wasn't even in color! i love this movie, it has to be the best movie i've ever put money down on. i am still shocked that it wasn't nominated for anything! if 10 is the highest you can give it, i give it 20!

i didn't really get this movie because i'm not some perv like you, who is into lesbian stuff.the girl in the red wig tries too hard to be funny (her lips are so silicone!), but she's really lame and insecure. she tries to come off like a surfer-guy (better than dressing slutty, but still weird and definitely unfashionable); the movie doesn't explain why she's trying to pass herself off as a man. oh, right, to "get" the poor, dumb girl. i forgot. she makes all these dumb inventions which are not funny, and she's a really lousy actress. plus, that waif look is so out!this dumb blond girl from melrose place plays(surprise) a dumb blond.she thinks the girl in the wig is a guy! they even make out! ewww! i guess that part was sort of funny.

there is a reason chairman of the board got a 2, (which is too high) this movie flat out is one of the worse movies of all time and i seen my share of rotten films. chairman of the board stars two of the most annoying actors/people today, carrot top and courtney thorne smith. carrot top just isn't funny anymore and wasn't in this piece of trash. courtney thorne smith isn't any better, just watch "according to jim" and you will see a prime example of what i am talking about. chairman of the board got a 1 from me, because that is low as you can go it is that bad. i am a little shocked that this piece of junk isn't on the imdb bottom 100 somewhere, i would put this in the top 5 on that list, but its slowly working its way there.

before i sat down and watched this film on hbo, i wasn't expecting nothing but a few laughs here and there and all together a stupid and common plot. well, that's exactly what i got out of it, except that i was somewhat satisfied at the end of the movie. i wasn't expecting it to be, i thought it was just going to be another hour and a half that i had on my hands to waste. well, it was, but still it was somewhat worth it. the whole plot was very stupid, cheap acting, and some of the lines were very very dumb. otherwise than that, it still had it's funny moments, even though not many.all in all, if you're going to rent this, don't. watch it on television. i gave it a 4, i was generous because it made me laugh, but yet it was still pretty stupid.

carrot top in a full length movie, enough said. only reason this doesn't get a one is through my personal voting system of only one 1 and one 10, and this is no extreme ops. horrible god awful. there are some movies that are so bad they are unintentionally funny, then there are movies that make you physically unwell and then there are those that lead to serious contemplation of suicide. burn all copies of the movie, shoot anyone who had non creative input on this movie, torture anyone with any creative input and as for the star, there are only so many things that can be said online, but he should be begging for the final ten seconds of existence with a severed head by the time the work is done.

this movies shook my will to live why this abomination isn't the bottom 100 list i don't know.my life was saved by the healing power of danny trejo.worst movie ever, i dare you watch. it's like a 90 minute collect calling commercial, only much much worse. i rather watch the blue screen it's that bad really

people don't seem to agree with me that movies can be bad and good at the same time. the same type of people that see a movie with carrot top on the cover, surfing through a frickin office and continue to watch the movie with serious expectations. is carrot top funny? of course not. was this movie anything special? of course not. it was a dumb movie and everyone assumed so simply based on what they know about mr. top. movies like this, or kazaam, or killer klowns from outer space and pretty much any movie pauly shore has ever been in are not meant to be taken seriously and because of this, they really shouldn't be considered some of the worst movies ever made. you watch them either expecting a dumb movie that's hilariously bad or you are like six years old and genuinely think carrot top is hilarious.please people if you ready know carrot top is retarded and you want to watch a serious movie and bother writing a serious review....don't watch this. picking on this movie is like picking on a 5 year old for not knowing the alphabet.

this is what they came up with for prop comedian carrot top's first feature film.a stupid surfer (carrot dude) inherits an r&d enterprise from an old kahuna (jack warden). things go less than swimmingly, but get much worse when the company is threatened with a hostile takeover attempt by corrupt corporate raiders. the most implausible thing about this movie is that smart-girl courtney thorne-smith would find this red-headed step-child fascinating in the least (but then, he just inherited millions). 'classic' moments include comic larry miller drinking sweat from a plastic cup.funny comedy? try un-funny toilet humor, and that's exactly where this belongs - in the toilet... flush twice.

is this a bad movie? don't take my word for it. consider the following press reports of people who tried to watch this movie: · while he was watching this movie, the brain of mr. harold faber of sandusky, ohio, forcibly ejected itself from his skull at over 200 kph and preceded to squirm across the floor shrieking noooo nooo noooo.· mrs. louise robbins of enid, oklahoma, a 69-year-old retired homemaker, committed ritual seppuko with a butter knife while watching this movie.· ms. janine hosmer of columbia, south carolina, gave birth to a severely deformed baby while watching this movie, although she had not been pregnant.· while watching this movie together, mr. and mrs. lawrence wells of san franciso, california, spontaneously exploded with such force that mr. wells's left tibia was later found embedded in the wall of a house in marin county.there have been many similar incidents.of those who did not suffers more serious effects such as those detailed above, at least 75% became incurably, violently, and understandably insane after viewing this movie. of the remaining 25%, most had already been insane before viewing the movie; the remainder were either blind and/or and deaf or in a persistent vegetative state.i'm not saying don't rent it, if you want to. i'm just reporting what was in the papers.

or at least forceable retirement! this movie is awful, horrible, terrible, rank, rotten, putrid... well, you get the idea. do not under any circumstances watch this piece of decaying garbage unless you have a death wish, because it's sure to kill you. (i only survived because i missed the first half hour.) carrot top is a bad comedian, and an even worse actor. i cannot believe he got anyone to fund this huge waste of time and money. it just goes to show that some people have no scruples if they think they might make a buck or two (literally... i can't imagine this made more than $2!).and someone please tell me what possible motivation courtney thorne smith (a halfway decent actress, certainly above this at any rate) had for signing onto this steaming pile of dung. was she that bored during that 3.5 second dry spell between melrose place and ally mcbeal? or did she owe some kind of karmic debt to the most annoying person on the face of the planet (aka carrot top)?i give this a 2/10, and that's probably way too high. i try to save my '1's for movies that make me vomit, and since i didn't see all of this one my stomach contents thankfully stayed contained. i don't think i'll be watching it again to find out if it's really worth a 1!

carrot top's "chairman of the board" and his at&t commercials are living proof that fly-blown fecal matter is available in the color orange. not freely available, however, as hbo charges for such garbage. blehhh! the saving grace of cotb is that it surely fills suicide hot-lines across the country, perhaps providing employment for thousands of telephone therapists who lost their jobs when recovered memory treatment was discredited, although (sadly) carrot top probably contributes to his sponsor at&t's bottom line with the increased phone traffic from devastated hbo viewers. i can visualize the hordes of traumatized tv viewers, phone in one hand and fully loaded .45 auto in the other hand, dialing out of last-minute desperation before walking off the plank of life to escape the specter of cotb's orange-haired monster echoing in their synapses like the agony of searing, irreversible meningeal swelling.

the film's title makes it sound like a porno but it's not even a sex comedy. instead, hot summer in barefoot county is about an official sent from a southern state to a small town to locate and arrest moonshiners. the moonshine though is coming from the farm of an old woman with three beautiful daughters. almost anyone can guess what happens next but oddly, the film is very tame. it hardly even qualifies for a pg rating. what's more, the low budget is obvious in pretty much every shot and the acting is sooooo amateurish. this film was probably intended for the drive-in crowd but it's unlikely that it satisfied them, even in 1974.

'nuff said. an undercover cop from the state capital is sent to a small county where moonshine running is rampant. he ends up getting run off the road by some local hicks who have no idea he's an undercover cop (so they just drive away as blissfully dopey as ever). he is soon being taken care of by a woman and her three daughters who all wear low-cut tops and short shorts (gotta luv the '70s). he falls in love with one of the girls but in the meantime he still has to find out who's making all the moonshine and driving it to all the local bars and restaurants. he also has to contend with a fat sheriff and his incompetent deputy who think he's the moonshiner 'cause he's new in town.life in small town america, 70s style. yee haaaaaaaaaaa.

one of the most pleasant surprises of this early 3-strip technicolor short was that a ballet dancer that appears here was named maria gambarelli! i half wondered if blake edwards was naming the character played by elke sommer in a shot in the dark after this now-forgotten performer (though the spelling of the sommer character's surname was actually gambrelli). i watched this on youtube mainly to see an early judy garland appearance as we watch her in profile with her two older sisters singing "la cucaracha". that was the highlight for me which otherwise showed some dances (like that of ms. gambarelli) that were enjoyable and some lame comedy between andy devine as a great bull-fighter (yeah, right!) and buster keaton as a bull owner who provides one that is obviously a man in animal costume. only funny part of those two is when they cry-with buster providing handkerchief to "bull"-during the sad part of "la cucaracha". also lame was seeing ted healy without his stooges dealing with a crasher who keeps mistaking healy for other movie stars. (healy himself didn't know zeppo had left the marx brothers since he puts "four" between "the" and "marx"!) speaking of a marx, it was interesting seeing harpo without his wig though he is wearing a hat to hide his bald head. also interesting was seeing ida lupino among the cowgirls in the beginning though i also recognized toby wing from her part in murder at the vanities last year (at least when announcer pete smith identified her). oh, and smith himself wasn't funny with his wise-guy narration. other famous stars you may or may not recognize are also in cameos and not all are m-g-m contract players either! so with all that said, la fiesta de santa barbara is worth a look for anyone curious about judy garland's early film appearances or the early use of 3-strip technicolor.

when i was 13 or so i was lucky enough to find this film. it was part of an endless danish series of really cheesy stuff. this however was the cheesiest i ever owned - but i guess i sold it, too bad. well what to write... better than "manos: the hands of fate" and worse than "critters 4". but it's definitely worth an hour and a half since this was made by people who wanted to make it. the acting isn't that terrible compared to several other eighties trash - in fact i kind of like the old man even though he did'nwt look that indian to me. but i guess you can't have everything... do yourselves a favour and look this up...

it didn't take too long after halloween had kicked off the slasher boom for the category to be cursed by continuous mediocrity. as early as 1983 the genre was already struggling to release more than three decent offerings per year and by '88 the stalk and slash flick had become pretty much the whipping boy of horror cinema. by that time major studios were all aware that repeating the tired formula was no longer a lucrative direction, which left it up to independent and mostly inexperienced filmmakers to continue the legacy that john carpenter had created. although there was still an impressive number of features hitting shelves in 88, most of them were weakly produced and taken as a whole they were eminently unappealing. with that said there were a couple of gems amongst the rubble. scott spiegel's intruder in its uncut form was a superb gross out classic, whilst evil dead trap proved that the cycle had not yet completely run out of style and panache. william lustig's maniac cop was successful enough to launch a franchise and two years later dead girls and mirage proved to be the last beguiling breaths of life in the ailing category.it was the continual release of schlock like berserker, blood lake and rush week that cursed the slasher movie to eight years of obscurity. it finally took the big budgeted flamboyance of wes craven's scream to provide the necessary resuscitation. having not heard anything about demon warrior before i came across it unexpectedly, i instantly assumed that it was part of the low brow trash that led to the downfall of the slasher phase. but with that said the movie boasts an intriguing premise that sits comfortably beside scalps and camping del terrore as another welcome addition to the native-american influenced catalogue.a truck pulls up on a woodland road and out step two laughably dramatised rednecks. the hillbilly lumberjacks are only on screen for around for ten seconds and then they are murdered by an unseen menace. next we meet a troupe of five young adults that are heading to the same location for a spot of shotgun-target-practice on some of the local wildlife. the area is owned by neil willard and has been passed down through three generations of his family. his grandfather stole the land from an indian medicine man that was rumoured to have left a curse on the property. according to legend, every ten years a demon warrior with an extreme hatred for mankind stalks the forest reaping revenge on those he deems responsible for the pilfering of the tribe's home. it wouldn't be much fun if those myths were a falsehood, so regular as clockwork a maniacal assassin turns up with a taste for blood. will the kids be able to stop this phantom killer?demon warrior is best described as a bigger budgeted (but still woefully cheap) re-imaging of fred olen ray's scalps. the bogeymen from both films are virtually identical and the director even throws in a scalping sequence to confirm my suspicions. things start promisingly with some crisp friday the 13th-style first-person cinematography and a couple of shock-jolts that were composed with finesse by director frank patterson. thomas callaway did a good job with the photography and the tribal-drum score makes a refreshing change from the more traditional late-eighties synthesizer rubbish. flourishes of suspense are juxtaposed with a couple of credible directorial embellishments and there are even a few attempts at humour. the killer looked successfully creepy in demon attire and the inclusion of a bow and arrow as the main murder weapon was a deft touch from the director.fred olen ray's notorious slasher was notable for its stark and credibly unsettling atmosphere. unfortunately despite being produced on twice the budget, demon warrior never comes close to the film that it so desperately emulates. rumor has it that the majority of the actors were drafted from the texas baylor university and were not even paid for their inclusion in the feature, so of course it goes without saying that the dramatics are appropriately abysmal. i especially enjoyed the hilarious john langione  an 'italian' native american (don't ask) that portrays about as much emotion as the trees in the forest that surrounded him. warrior started with some credible glimpses of panache from the director that actually led me to believe that this could be a welcome inclusion to the slasher index. unfortunately, the poisonous cocktail of heinous acting and an ending plucked directly from stupidsville seriously changed the initial plan i had in mind for a rating. it's a shame that the dramatics were so scraped from the bottom of the thespian barrel, because at times demon warrior showed flashes of potential.all in all, patterson's movie is a mixed bag of ideas  some of them were good, but mostly they were staggeringly mediocre. because this was released at a time when the slasher genre had been watered down to avoid the scissor happy censors, there's really no gore worth mentioning. even the scalping sequence is relatively tame compared to olen ray's graphic depiction. demon warrior has the odd moment of credibility, but not often enough to warrant a purchase. not as bad as the aforementioned berserker, blood lake et al, but not really that good either..

i like a lot of myrna loy movies. this film was produced before her character actor personality was developed. it would be an okay short film but seems to go on forever in it's complete form.myrna loy it seems is told what to do with her acting and does the job. that is about all you can say about her.her gypsy character is shoddy and the film has many flaws, such as the jewelry shop scene.this film will probably be interesting to myrna loy fans but even as such is something of a disappointment.

into a happy household comes the gypsy girl, played by myrna loy. with her amazingly wild hair and voice that sounds very high-pitched and weird, it's hard to believe this is loy!! she bears no similarity whatsoever to the refined and funny character nora charles who she played in the thin man movies. instead, she overacts so badly that you'd almost expect her to be in an ed wood movie. what a huge difference a few years made in the quality films she got as well as her acting ability!! on top of the horrendously silly character, the film also fails because it just isn't interesting or exciting--just very, very stagy and stupid. the only thing good about it is the vitaphone sound system--making the sound quality of this turkey about the best i have heard from 1929. heck, it was even better than most 1930 films, so the sound technician at least has something to be proud of--all others, forget it.this is a movie that even the host of turner classic movies referred to as a "guilty pleasure" because the movie is so bad! and, after having seen it i disagree...slightly. the movie is simply bad.

it's as if the editor and screenwriter only had 40 minutes of real running time. this is supposed to be a remake of a chinese film, which is obviously far superior to this trash. it's clear that some brainless hollywood suit or writer decided that this movie would be mano a mano, man against man, instead of just letting the story play out with the personalities of the characters that were built in the first 40 minutes. at this point in the film, the characters just don't act like regular people and not even like their own personalities. it makes little sense. it's quite clear why this film flopped. it's just not believable at all and that's too bad - it started out with promise. don't be fooled.

"tank girl" was, i suppose, meant to be the "buckaroo banzai" of the 90's and was marketed as such. the comparison is, admittedly, appropriate; both movies have so many things going on in any given frame of film that, as impossible as the story is to sort out, it certainly isn't boring."tank girl" is a fun enough ride if you turn your brain off before the movie starts. otherwise you'll end up with a skull-cracking headache like me.

as if the world hadn't already got enough cheap jaws imitations, writer boaz davidson decided to make the sequel to his ropey-but-reasonably-enjoyable creature-feature octopus a complete rip-off of spielberg's classic, right down to having a concerned cop who no-one believes, and a mayor more worried about his 4th july celebrations than people's lives.even in the hands of an extremely skilled director, it is unlikely that this derivative rubbish could have been anything other than hokey b-movie garbage, but with yossi wein (yes the yossi wein!) calling the shots behind the camera, a man with a fraction of mr.spielberg's talent (i estimate about 1/10000th), octopus 2 is guaranteed to be every bit as bad as one might imagine!the predictable and extremely clichéd plot isn't worth describing in much detail (substitute jaws' amity island with new york, and bruce the shark with a giant rubber octopus and you'll get the gist), although several points about the film are definitely worth mentioning, simply because they are so funny: all of the octopus attacks involve the actors struggling to make incredibly fake-looking giant tentacles look real, which is hilarious to behold; bulgaria's capital, sofia, unconvincingly stands in for new york, and overuse of stock footage makes the illusion even less convincing; best of all, a silly dream sequence that sees the rubber octopus attacking our hero atop the statue of liberty, is not only gut-bustingly stupid but also features some truly dreadful special effects.davidson's script also doesn't know when to quit: there are several points in this film at which it could've (and probably should've) ended, but the action goes on and on, with the octopus surviving several explosions, and causing a tunnel to collapse (trapping the film's love interest and a bunch of kids), before finally being blown to smithereens by the hero.sometimes very silly, always awful technically, but never actually scary, this stv stinker may find fans amongst those who actively seek out cinematic trash. most normal people, however, would be advised to steer well clear.

oh wow, the character shares my name first name! nick! this movie as bad as the first one, if not worse. well, at least there's an actual octopus in this movie. an actual octopus that makes a better appearance in this film. by better, i mean, "longer" the acting is pretty dry and it's hard to sit through. just to let you know, when this ninety minute film ends not only are you freed from your couch but you get your ability to breathe back. not only that, but you realise how stupid you are and then commit suicide, realising how horrible life is after watching this film. really, it shows how desperate horror movies are today, more crap like this is being realised and where the hell have the real masters of horror been lately? this film should have been the final straw, so we can bring back cinematic geniuses in horror cinema, that could make some actually good modern horror films, this movie bites.

just finished watching this one after getting sick of getting ready for the michigan bar exam. i wanted something that was mindless and that i could just sit back and say, "what the hell were they thinking?" i was not disappointed in this undertaking, but had i been watching this one in a serious mood, i would have been irate. the company that made this thing just spliced cgi footage from the first octopus and added a little footage with a fake octopus that makes the one used in "bride of the monster" look like a masterpiece of special effect footage. since when does an octopus have fangs? the plot is that an nypd diver is investigating some murders/disappearances on the hudson river shortly before the fourth of july. he and his partner (who is soon to be transferred, or soon to be munched on by a fig bucking octopus) investigate in a rather inept manner (all the while believing that a huge octopus will kill people) and are occasionally accompanied by a female lackey from the mayor's office. of course on one believes that an octopus can get that big until the thing attacks the cop and the girl from the mayor's office. surprisingly, all hell doesn't break loose and only a few cops and a few more civilians are killed.really lame. don't bother with it.

a flesh-eating octopus, where does that guy boaz(what the..?) davidson keep getting inspiration? anyway,even for the low,low standards of both the giant sea animal who kills people-genre and me,this one is just beyond awful.the octopus is one of the lamest,laziest,weakest monsters i've ever seen.i think he just ended up in the (ahum)east river because sea world got sick of him.the actors can be seen repeatedly helping the octopus choking them.bunch of idiots,that way he'll never learn!you guys want all the other giant killer octopuses(that's the correct plural,by the way)to laugh at him?meanies.up to stop the octopus are wind,razors that are hard to handle and also special sea agent nick hartfield and his partner,who will retire in a week but first has to be eaten by the octopus.hooray,octopus won the fight!a couple more and he's going to evolve(the scars in my mind stay).nick of course tries to help him by not doing a damn thing(doesn't he have a gun or something?)but no,that magically doesn't help either.okay,enter sea cop's love interest rachel starbird.is this based on some comic book or something?anyway,together they try to stop the octopus by walking in the park.they hope this helps,cos it's the 4th of july in a couple of days,and the octopus might join the party.and you don't know what he's like when he's drunk.rachel then gets a school bus from out of nowhere to make sure this movie won't end while nick feeds the octopus some more sea cops.but all's crappy that ends crappy,nick manages to blow the octopus to bits a couple of times,and a bunch of children who happened to be there cheer and laugh.you know,on tummy-vision,this would probably get an r.in real life,i'd say all ages but i kinda like all ages so my final idea is:suitable for absolutely nobody.there's no sex,no gore,no nothing.now forget this movie ever existed.join the club.

well,there isnt much to say about this movie. its simply trash. very poor acting, poor script, and lame story.... well, the actress,(i odnt even know her name) who played mainrole,(not the blond one,but latina one) was acting fine,but the blond one who played the friend of main charactor,,,her acting level is just like highschool play,so as most of other actors in the movie. also,zombies,,,,very bad acting as well. and,,the story itself has really no point at all. well, if you are really bored and really got nothing to do,but wanna kill time somehow, maybe you may wanna watch this movie,but eventho,there are still millions of better b movies than this crap. its total waste of money and time.

very simply, they are all the syndicated episodes and not the original uncut/unedited nbc episodes. it is not the complete first season, all eps are edited to conform to 21:00 for syndication meaning jokes are cut, an extra commercial fade is included, all of the harvey korman intros are not here...very poorly done! shame on a series i've been waiting for....booooooooooooooooo! if you're a true die hard mama fan, don't buy this and go to http://www2.warnerbros.com/web/main/help/whv/customer_service.jsp and send them comments on why we're unhappy on this butcher job to a classic sitcom!

this guy is a real piece of work. an angry, immature boy in a grown man's body, packing all the charisma of a rock, he goes around to places most people would only wish to visit and does his best to be as miserable as possible.give this job to someone else who actually appreciates it.i could go down an endless list of all the stupid things this guy does in his "episodes," though i'll just highlight the worst: crete. while the locals are putting up seaside picnics in his "honour," this clown has the gall to act like a petulant, spoiled child. he complains about everything, including the fashion sense of the people who live there. what an imbecile.when he went to sweden, he spent at least five minutes feigning incredulity at a bunch of chefs (who probably had better things to do than talk with some dimwit american, like work) because they didn't think abba was horrible. everywhere he went, he brought up abba. this is the kind of talk you'd hear from 13-year-olds who watch too much mtv.when he was in new orleans, he got upset that a certain restaurant had better-tasting fries than his, so he "accidentally" spilled some wine on them in order to ruin them. what a strange, emotionally unstable person.the worst of it all are his clumsy voice-overs, where he attempts in vain to add some kind of perspective on a situation he was too thick and ignorant to appreciate. he tries to use all these "big" words in order to sound like an author, but he's really just a pretentious hack whose lack of awareness has convinced him he has something to say. that, by the way, is probably the one good thing about this joker's tv show. it goes to show you, no matter how inept you are, as long as you take yourself seriously enough, the world will as well.then there's the way he speaks with local guides whose english is obviously only rudimentary. he'll use vocabulary any writer--as he believes himself to be--would instinctively know will most likely not be understood by these people. does he care? no. self-important schmucks like this bourdain clown do not use language to communicate; they use it to make themselves look important.mcg13jthm's review on this same page is a perfect example of the kind of mind bourdain attracts--that of a low iq social misfit. observe how the reviewer attempts to justify bourdain's sociopath nature with simple-minded, childish excuses that hardly make sense. "bourdain may complain but he goes through 'a lot' and, not only that, he was 'forced' to do this show but is trying to redeem himself." a dolt attracts dolts, and reading mcg13jthm's review should let you know perfectly well whether or not you are the kind of person who'd enjoy this utterly useless, pointless show.finally, to add a bit of "fairness" to my diatribe, i admit bourdain would have been momentarily amusing had i met him in a bar. but as a tv host of a travel show whose purpose is to show the viewer the beauty of other places and cultures, bourdain is a miserable, abject, hopeless, grim and depressing failure.a failure.

a man wonders if his hunky co-worker is gay. at a yard sale he finds a ray gun called "gaydar". you point it at a person, pull the trigger and it tells you how gay they are. he tries it out, it works and he sets out to find out if his coworker is gay like him...promising idea ruined by an unfunny script (after a promising beginning) and terrible acting. the entire cast overacts and basically scream their lines at each other constantly. it gets annoying and really embarassing after a while. the saving grace is that's it is short, there's a scene stealing cat (love her fall out of the kitty bed) and charles nelson reilly is hysterical in his brief bit. but none of this saves the movie. i can't recommend this at all.

the fun that was present in the other 'movies' has all but disappeared with this third effort, which means the rubbishy production values show through more than ever. another 2-parter ('the chinese web') cobbled together, this one suffers from too much padding, not to mention weak spidey action taking place in such uninspired locations as a car park, apartment and printing press. nicholas hammond is as endearing as ever, struggling valiantly against the drab production and lame performances of the rest of the cast. the plot, in which peter and spidey help a chinese official defeat charge of corruption during world war ii by locating three marines who could testify as to his innocence, doesn't exactly scream 'comic book sprung to life', does it?

the film starts out great, with a mock instruction film about the habits of swedish housewives. after that we get a detailed reconstruction of post-war scandinavia with lots of amazing cars, electronic equipment and interior design; a minimal jazz score, nice cinematography and stylish titling. also there's some funny scandinivian rivalry like in von triers 'riget'.sadly, after the set up, "kitchen stories" collapses like the twin towers on 9/11.actors who try to portray the emotion 'jealousy" by just staring in front of them. corny dialog filled with stale gay symbolism in the vain of: "i don't like white swans, i prefer bears and wolves... u ever tasted bear meat?" the music becomes cheesier than yann tiersen at his worst.it's a pity the director put all the effort in this great set-up, just to screw it up after-wards.

first, let me mention the fact that, in spite of its title («stories», in plural), there is only one kitchen story. as to whether isak died or not at the end, i'm not so sure since, in one of the very last scenes, his pipe is seen lying on the table next to the two cups. on the dvd cover, there is a reference to tati. it claims that the film is «très drôle: rappelle tati !» («very funny: reminiscent of tati!». the great jacques tati relied mainly on mime and silent deadpan attitudes to achieve his comical effects and to offer his critically satiric views of his 1950’s french «modern» society. of course «kitchen» does take place during the 1950’s and it does offer some (rather faint) satirical references to the absurdities of bureaucracy and there are some long moments were no words are uttered -– but they are not really funny. are all these small details enough to make «kitchen» a «tatiesque» movie ? this being said, i have to admit that «kitchen» does deal with the sometimes false objectivity of scientific research versus the «truth» of human subjective emotions. generally speaking, the movie was agonizingly slow, with nothing much happening -- with barely any «dramatic impulse» : the involving parts were the set up during the first 15 minutes or so, and during the last half hour or so. indeed, the last segment was -- finally !!! -- interesting and moving. it might seem that it was a short subject, of less than an hour, unduly stretched to some 90 minutes. now, about the set-up (a «scientific» observation on the behavior of single males in their kitchen): at first it seemed very promising –- with the charting out of the comings and goings of bachelors in their kitchen as a means to determine what new inventions would be most useful to come up with. but very quickly this premise turned out to be just a prologue, an «excuse» to introduce the real subject which was only fully developed towards the end and which was about loneliness and the invaluable bond of friendship. pity ! i honestly wanted to like that movie. yes, it seemed so promising when i heard about some of its unusual little «anecdotes» -- which were indeed there and which i enjoyed -– such as the burning of a man’s nose hair (instead of using scissors to cut it off), the «investment» of having a huge quantity of «valuable» black pepper stacked away in a barn, the role reversals (the observant becoming the observed), a man’s mouth emitting sounds from a radio program. and there is also a sick horse becoming the catalyst of half-hidden human despair, the relative importance of right or left side car driving in sweden and norway (a reflection of the importance for each of these very close neighboring countries to affirm its individuality ?). am i the sole person who did not fully enjoy that film ? does this necessarily mean that i'm wrong ? perhaps it’s almost generally praised «fine points» were, in fact, «too subtle» for me ? perhaps... could my individual views on this movie ironically reflect the very essence of the film itself -- which would be the vital necessity to have the right to differ, to affirm one’s individuality and not to follow blindly society’s trends and opinions ? each one of us has the right to have different personal views and not to be a slave of the demands of one’s bread-winning «dictatorial» demands: often, we do have other alternatives that would allow each one of us to be useful to our society while respecting one’s inner principles. in short, being true to oneself -– the way that in that film folke (isak’s «scientific observer») ends up by giving up his job while preferring to stay in his new friend isak’s house and help his out with the tasks of his farm ... and so, «vive la différence», as the french say !

is it just me or the fact that the evil racing team is japanese and that their arrogant star racer is german seem a little over the top? maybe that is how it is on the international racing circuit but if all america had representing them are chumps like cody and his mechanic chris (peter berg, who must have been still learning how to act) then i would be rooting for another country. formula movies can be good but the characters have to be likeable and no one meets that criteria in this movie. to put it succinctly - a very bad movie.

what a dire film. i cannot believe that i actually sat down and watched it. a very, very, very, very, very, very pathetic effort, with no redeeming features whatsoever. hateeeeeeedddd ittttt! the so-called "racing" sequences are laughably awful, and the plot was so bad, i've forgotten it. part of the film was made at the spa-francorchamps course in belgium in, i think, 1988, during the actual grand prix there. i was there and am glad i didn't appear in any of the paddock scenes shown in the film. it could have been good...what a pity.

i love the book. it's full of passion, romance, tension... and the movie drags along taking two spunky stars with it. kylie minogue was already a major star in australia, having starred in neighbours and releasing her first single. the decision to cast her in the delinquents was surely a marketing ploy. for me, it didn't pay off.kylie may have been great in neighbours, but she was far too sweet and innocent to play the feisty lola... and, she wasn't of asian descent as lola was. charlie schlatter was an excellent brownie, but there was no chemistry between him and kylie.by and large, the movie was boring. it dragged on, it lacked the passion of the book, it focused heavily on kylie and in general, was completely disappointing.

i was living in barstow ca. in 1968 when the movie the killers three arrived at the local theater. the trailer was enough to get me to pay my hard earned money to see this movie. i was really expecting a bonnie and clyde movie and i got dick clark playing a shy nerdy guy while robert walker and diane varsi played an poor attempt of reinacting bonnie and clyde. needless to say it never went over well. maybe this is why it never made it to video. even as a kid i was left some what ripped off as i left the theater. after all the best parts where in the trailer of the movie. the movie was dull and pretty much pointless. by the way, dick clark gets killed so it wasn't a total let down.

this film was shot in randolph county in central north carolina in 1968 when a film crew in the state was a rare thing. the locations were the municipalities of liberty and ramseur and the surrounding rural countryside. it is not a particularly good movie. it did have merle haggard and it brought life to the hinterlands for a few minutes.the plot is standard shootemup. the cinematography is that fuzzy stuff that came out of the late sixties and early seventies. the local folks were thrilled to be a part of the enterprise.if viewers have difficulty finding a copy of this film, a record copy is available in asheboro, nc.actors not credited include ben jones, mimi pravda, tommy hull, bill nunnery.

i am shocked by all the good reviews on the cover of this movie and on imdb. it belongs in the $2 bin at your local video store. to say that this is a b movie is extremely generous.besides lacking a single redeemable character, only slightly better than average acting, and an ugly 80's style picture quality, the script for this film is dull and lifeless. this film is not only boring--it is pathetic. (admittedly, there is occasionally some mildly interesting chemistry between the two main characters.) even the final plot twist--rather, the only plot twist--does not save this film.rent "diamond men" if you must, but do not hesitate to turn it off once you become appraised of its worthlessness. 2 out of 10.

man alive, is this game bad or what? the graphics are way below par, even if it were on a playstation 1, never mind a gamecube. the gameplay is pathetic and the camera movements disorientating. what a worthless game!i totally love warner's batman animation and it's cool that they do all the games in this way. batman: vengeance could well have turned out great as they got off to a good start by keeping all the gothic visuals and voice actors but they seriously stumbled when it came to playability and graphics. the result is a boring game that looks incredibly cheap and is no fun to play whatsoever. i really must stress how bad the graphics are. don't let the color schemes fool you. i've seen better stuff on a commodore 64.

was the cast and crew on drugs before they started filming this? there was a hole in the plot...so big...nothing could have filled it up. from the first scene when the co-star is late for dinner, was there any doubt where he was and what he had just done? the suspense was over from there. now, it was going to take another 85 minutes before the mystery was solved. i must confess that the biggest hole in the plot kept me awake for hours, wondering how dumb the screenwriter, the director, chrisian slater, molly parker, and stephen rea could be not to at least explain how our murderer, who was not a lawyer, or a policeman, could go into a locked cell at a jail, kill his second victim, and tie him up from a noose to make it look like suicide??? i kept wondering if i had fallen asleep out of sheer boredom and missed how that happened. if someone can explain it to me, please do...and then, why, for god's sake, did he kill the third victim? nothing made sense...and yet, someone thought this film was worthy to be an official selection at a film festival. perhaps it was a comedy and i failed to laugh.

the story is shortly about the faith-lacking business man priest, daniel clemens (christian slater), who is looking closer on a case where another priest is suspected for murder. the priest denies he's guilty but at the same time he is not able to discuss the matter due to confidentiality. enter daniel clemens who starts playing cop...while the plot isn't ridiculous, everything else is. let's start with the visual side, the cinematography is dull, it looks more like a tv-series than a movie. the camera angles are boring, in fact, there's not a single memorable camera angle in the entire movie. there's no interesting closeups revealing details. and the scene transitions, well, there's not much to say about those, they aren't smooth at all, there seems to be no connection between the scenes than the actual plot. okay, they did use a transition with music in between two scenes, but there are no interesting visual transitions in the entire movie, the times dissolve was used there was no visual connection between the scenes.the boring visual part could be forgiven if the film would offer anything else. unfortunately the film only offers forced wooden acting and clumsy dialogue with no punch. on top of that the film suffers from audio problems, the sound volume is lowered several times in the movie as if the microphones would be too far.i didn't predict the solution of the film. it could be because the film never gave me the opportunity or it could be due to the presentation, which was so boring i never even tried to figure it out.put two plus two together and it equals a b-movie where 'b' stands for boring.

isn't it depressing how the most violent cartoon on cartoon network is aimed at girls? while i'm not watching soldiers getting shot and blown up on saving private ryan or band of brothers, it would be nice if there was a cartoon or at least something on tv i could watch to satisfy my violent urges. and something that i would not get made fun of for watching. i did see some episodes (i should really be shot for this) and had to sit through the movie (now, where do i find a gun?), and it is quite clear that this lost its spark after the first few episodes. if you like seeing 500-foot monsters that can destroy huge cities in seconds getting slaughtered by toddlers about one foot tall, this is a must-see. but it does get very boring after a while, and with a show like this, even original ideas become chiefly dull. the movie just felt like one overlong episode (i can't remember any of it), and the villain should have been far more intimidating than a green monkey. this show is a laughing stock. it churns out the same basic premise episode after episode after episode, and though it may try to have some mystery and intrigue once in a while, the ending will always be the same - "the powerpuff girls save the day!" all is good and nice, but all is very, very repetitive... i give it 3 out of 10 for being the only danged cartoon on cn to revolve around violence, although it is aimed at girls, so i won't be tuning in for it ever. i've established myself as a fan of war and violence films and i won't have that reputation destroyed... 3/10

when i first watched this show on cartoon network, i found it uninteresting. then i read a lot of good messages about this show, and i decided to watch it. the show was so boring. each episode was predictable. more, this show has no logic. hypersmart girls, who are going to school and sometimes do such stupid things, 99% of episodes start with a monster attacking townswille, then mayor (he is a real fool, he is not funny, he is so stupid, that i can't imagine how he became a mayor). professor, yes, supposed to be the smartest person in this show, but actually... he even found no difference between monster and his brother. narrator's comments also make this show boring. because they also have similar lines in the beginning of each episode and in the ending. also the animation is very strange. everything except main heroes is shown in an ugly way. also in every epsode this show is giving you some life-lessons, and it means that it is oriented on little children, but if you look closer, you will see, that there is a lot of violence and even blood(!!!) during their battles.

...but i would be lying. a relative was a crew member, and we got to go watch the production of this movie for a couple of days (and i was an extra). i get to die and have a second of screen time, not that i plan on moving to hollywood anytime soon. i just thought it was awesome to see how movies are made and be a part of it. plus, i got a copy of the movie once it was finally released. they didn't have a studio backing when making this film so it truly was independent. why the writing and acting is so awful is beyond me, but the main character "cherry" is the director's sister so that could be part of it. but the cinematography was good. :)

i don't mean to sound pretentious here, but to call this the next cult classic is yet another example of the lowering standards filmmakers have for themselves. this movie is an offense to everything we hold sacred, and not in the good "artsy " way of offending. this film becomes the archetype for painful dialogue, delivered by even more pathetic actors.

saw the film at it's lawrence, kansas premiere. this wavering story about a group of disgruntled highschoolers killing off the competition for prom queen was just awful. it fails for many reasons - bad acting, bad script, no clear point. but mainly it just felt like the filmmakers said to themselves - "hey i have some money, so let's make a movie!" - without really thinking it out. sorrowfully most indie films that don't make it suffer from just that mentality. they just don't seem to realize that it takes more than money to make a good movie... or in this case, even a watchable one. with this film i do not feel ashamed to say, that if i didn't know some of the crew, i would have walked out. simple as that.

this is a really really bad movie. that may seem like an oversimplification. a fickle, childish retort comparable to a petty unsubstantiated insult. the truth is, there is not enough i can say about the confusing senseless plot, the really atrocious acting (i'm talking nasty here folks), or the random images of violence toward women that make up the chaotic pastiche of radically horrendous film-making mistakes that propel this affront to all that is good and decent in the world of cinema, nay, human culture. please, take my word for it, don't watch it... ever. i'm serious. stop. you'll thank me for it later.

with pep squad receiving an average of 4.7 on imdb.com, no wonder steve balderson slanders this website so. but the fact is that pep squad is a poorly crafted "black" "comedy" (both words in quotation marks for a reason). it's a movie full of over-acting (cherry, beth's mother), coupled with a couple of lethargic performances (beth and julie's boyfriend). a movie where you can follow cars from twenty feet away in a gaudy red jeep and never be noticed. a movie chock full of not-so-appetizing cleavage and nudity shots that make you wonder, "does the director think this is funny? or clever?" most of all, the characters are so paper-thin and poorly developed that the film becomes quite unpredictable, but probably not on purpose. pep squad can't decide whether to be a comedy, or a drama, or a satire (patriotic music, i get it...). the movie fails at being serious, because the idea of killing for any school position (this being prom queen) crosses the line into insanity (not to mention shots of flag burning and drive-by shootings, a poor attempt at being controversial and edgy), and fails at being a comedy, for all the forced and awkwardly placed jokes (big butt mama, "funky" black principal, and excessive cussing delivered poorly by the principal cast). watching the documentary "wamego: making movies anywhere" only made this film more cringe-worthy, with praise lauded towards it by... the director and the director's father... hmmmmmm. not a black comedy, or anything for that matter. i guess kansas will have to wait.

this should have been a short film, nothing more. the length of 1,5 hours is much too long, because after 10 minutes you have seen almost every joke. it's getting more and more on your nerves untill you finally kick out your brain to endure that movie.to do yourself a favor, don't mention to see that movie...

yep, this has got to be one of the lamest movies i've ever seen. it's utterly tasteless, has no style whatsoever, the story is so thin that you can watch television through it, and the whole film has so many holes you could drive an oil tanker through it.sure, i appreciate a good b-movie as much as most male white homo sapiens do. but this has got to be the worst i've seen. in fact it's so b that it lacks everything that makes a b-movie interesting.the whole movie is based around such charming artefacts as the characters beating the crap out of each other, various bodily functions and the complete lack of sanity of anything on-screen.it's not even funny. in fact it's quite the opposite. i found it even boring at times due to it's extreme predictability.i find nothing good to say about this movie. it was a waste of time watching it, and i hope others don't do the same mistake. if you also pay for it you should get a serious brainscan done.

the unthinkable has happened. having first witnessed it a few years ago, i have had a film that has been my benchmark for awfulness and that film was called "mccinsey's island". a family adventure movie with hulk hogan and grace jones (i'm not making this up), it plunged to new depths of movie making and is still the only film i've seen that made me wonder what else the film's budget could have been spent on. like new schools or cancer-treating drugs. however, for sheer and unadulterated levels of crap, any film will be having to lower their standards even lower if they wish to trump "guest house paradiso" to the distinction of being one of the very worst movies i've ever had to watch.based loosely around the puerile but amusing tv show "bottom", this film introduces us to two of the biggest losers imaginable. richard (rik mayall) is a hotel manager, as unfriendly as anyone you can imagine and so twistedly lecherous as to almost ooze slime from every action. his buddy eddie (director adrian edmondson) is an alcoholic waste of human life and together, they try to run britain's worst hotel situated upon a cliff-top next to a nuclear power station. between them, they indulge in cartoony violence (with sound effects) at regular intervals, steal anything remotely valuable or interesting from the fools who stay there and stare longingly at any woman at all. the plot, such as it is, involves the arrival of fabled italian screen goddess gina carbonara (vincent cassel) who is fleeing from her wedding and attempts to lay low at the guest house paradiso, much to the astonishment of richie and eddie. and... that's it.i used to think that the carry on films represented everything bad about the uk film industry and god knows, we've spent so much time and money trying to escape that god awful legacy. we've had films like "trainspotting", "28 days later", "four weddings and a funeral" and the brilliant "shaun of the dead" (also starring simon pegg) but this... this drags those films screaming and kicking back to the days of sid james and barbara windsor's top flying off with the aid of a bicycle whistle. "guest house paradiso" is so low in its ambition that it insults you the minute you watch it. i kept watching, waiting in anticipation for the jokes to start but they never came. just an endless stream of trapped knob gags, unimaginative scenarios that defy explanation, slightly amusing violence with frying pans and fridge doors and almost nothing raising so much as a smirk. come the first ad break (it was on tv, you see) and i was ready to switch off but my loyal duties to you, my readers, kept me going. "i'm watching this so they don't have to" became my mantra so you guys better remember how much you owe me for this because this was about as much fun as having sand kicking into my eyes and being force-fed dog food.trust me, i used to love the "bottom" tv show. the combination of suitably grubby acting from mayall and edmondson with ott juvenile humour worked... for half an hour every week. certainly not for an hour and a half, as edmondson and mayall indulge themselves in their little private joke and bore and depress the rest of the audience. honestly, this makes mayall's "drop dead fred" seem like "the godfather" and should you happen to meet either of these two people (who are pretty much solely responsible for the chaos on screen pretending to be a movie), feel free to swiftly deliver a boot to their testicle region. they'd probably enjoy it. pegg and bill nighy (both as guests at the hotel) are dragged down with this sinking ship but at least they survived. mayall and edmondson should not be so lucky. the movie equivalent of chernobyl and should be avoided as such.

wow, this film was terrible. it is as simple as that. it is actually the first time that i walked out early, as far as i can remember. this turned out okay, though: i had a very nice chat with two most charming girls while we all waited for the rest to finally give up on that crap they called a "movie".where to start. bad acting, bad jokes. faecal humour, which i simply cannot stand. sorry, but snot, pee and scat are *not* funny. you have seen the title picture? that scene actually drags on for about 5 minutes, with the two "heroes" hitting and mutilating each other, which is supposed to be humorous all by itself. it is not.apart from body fluids, violence and cross-dressing, i do not remember much about this. at least not much good. i was really, really disappointed by this piece of garbage. or let us be honest here: given that i am actually a big fan of "british" (i.e., black) humour, i was angry.so, want my advice? three words: do not watch.

i have always been a fan of bottom, grabbing as many videos as i could find of the series here in the states. the chemistry between rik and ade is always genius, and the combination of smart writing and utterly stupid humor seems to work without fail. i thus sat down to watch this movie with great eagerness... and was utterly disappointed by the end.the first 3/4 of the movie can best be described as uninspired and poorly directed (sorry, ade!), but with some utterly brilliant moments. unfortunately, these laugh-out-loud moments make you realize how less-than-brilliant the rest of the movie is. the slapstick starts off funny but eventually becomes a bit boring, with only the perverted sex jokes to keep things humorous.the end of the movie (the 'green' scenes, for those of you who've seen it) was... perhaps the worst ending i've seen in the past decade. honestly. it was one joke repeated about thirty times, followed by an abrupt ending that made no sense (which didn't bother me) and wasn't funny (which did).to sum up, i was sorely disappointed by this movie. i shall cling to the few brilliant moments in it, to retain the fondest memories that i can... but i have to warn you, if you're about to overpay for your ntsc conversion tape from the local importer, don't. there are far better things to spend your money on.

the premise of bottom crossed with fawlty towers sounds great! however, ade edmonson & rik mayall have managed to create a film that raises barely a titter. ten years ago, rik mayall's mad stare and ade's idiocy were funny, now they are just annoying.the film had promise - though the most horrendous hotel in britain is not a new idea - but failed to deliver. the saving graces were competent performances from simon (spaced, big train) pegg and helene mathieu, and the film is only 90 minutes long. sorry, guys, but you really have hit the bottom

being a huge fan of the bottom series i was really looking forward to the release of this film.i was eagerly anticipating a laugh a minute roller-coaster ride......alas.where to start on this mess?i think its a good start to say that its hardly richie and eddie on our screens in the first place as none of the jokes and one liners they usually deliver so well are funny.i was still waiting for the first laugh after a good 20 minutes of viewing.many aspects of the story were pathetic and it was as if the film was full of those bad moments they rehearsed and decided to leave out of the final cut.the overall sets and atmosphere surrounding the film is dark and dingy which i suppose is good if they want to portray the 'terrible' guest house the 2 buffoons attempt to run,but to me its just puts an even higher dampener on a sorry state of filming that should never have been created.the acting,at times,is pathetic.fenella fielding is wasted as the loony mrs foxfur and i've seen simon pegg have much better outings.i'd recommend guest house paradiso to anybody who is blind drunk because they might appreciate the terrible puns much more.but to any bottom fan who hasn't seen this film and is expecting true richie and eddie action you have been warned

i had seen rik mayall in blackadder and the new statesman, so i thought i'd give this film a try.at around 4 pm i bought it, at around 8pm i started to watch, at around 8.15pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain... but there wasn't. at around 8.45pm i threw the dvd into the dustbin. and that's where this "film" belongs.what ever happened to british humour? the humour so fine and witty, intelligent and artful that you find in yes, minister, blackadder, vicar of dibley, fawlty towers or the fast show? the black humour britain is so famous for? i don't want to insult anybody, but i presume even stupid children wouldn't find this funny. they deserve more intelligent fun. and rik mayall, you can do better, so please, do!

possibly the worst film within the genre in existence. it was announced as a comedy, but is simply tragically pathetic. i don't think anyone could have achieved anything more terrible and irritating if they were specifically requested to. it is toilet humour at its very poorest, i would avoid even watching the trailer. i only went to see it because it was announced that if you like monty python, you are bound to love this. whoever wrote that was either biased or seriously deranged. i am still bewildered how one can honestly believe such a statement. rarely do i leave the cinema, really it takes a lot of effort for a film to have that effect on me: this one did it in just 30 minutes.

the first time i had heard of guest house paridiso was in the, er... "washroom" after having just seen fight club. in each urinal was deposited a small, round black circle. when the circle came into contact with moisture (to put it delicately), it caused a colour picture to form, with photographs of the two stars and the tag line "you'll p*** yourself laughing". when you'd finished washing your hands, the circle had dried and faded to black again, waiting to spring it's surprise on the next "victim".okay, maybe the punchline wasn't terribly sophisticated, but you have to admit it was innovative. in fact, i think i can honestly say i've never seen anything like it in my life before, and these days of over a century of cinema and marketing, that's a real feat. what a pity the film that went with it failed to live up to the promise.i hate to pan guest house paridiso and i am indebted to rik mayall (richard twat) and adrian edmondson (eddie elizabeth ndingombaba) for many years of laughter through their appealing television series, be it the invention of the young ones (1982-1984), the sitting room plays of bottom (1991-1995), or even solo work, such as rik in the new statesman (1988-1993). in fact, this would have made an hilarious 45 minute tv special. unfortunately, its an 89 minute film.there's definitely some merit to be had, and i laughed continuously throughout the protracted finale, which spoofed the exorcist and raiders of the lost ark, and involved... well, you'll have to see that bit for yourself. yet often the pace is leaden, and a sterile atmosphere is throughout. the two stars (edmondson taking his usual backseat, this time due to the fact that he adequately directs) never really get into first gear, mayall only sporadically showing the foul-mouthed mania that makes us love him on the small screen. indeed, the writers' presumption that we are already familiar with the characters leads to them being underdelivered to the audience. the slight hints of depth seen in the series (richie's effeminate, failed social-climbing for example) are not present here, and instead we are left with parodies of parodies.the fawlty towers accusation does pass water, complete with drunken chef and unseen, called-for waiter "pasquele", which uncannily rhymes with manuel. some of the ideas, such a hotel next to a nuclear reactor with a childrens' swing hanging over a cliff face, are very, very funny, but ultimately the frenetic pace is stolen, the two constantly looking for a studio audience that isn't there, and all the "dead laugh" areas patched up with incidental "comedy" music that would have been dated in a carry on film two decades ago.paridiso's brand of puerile, sadistic, perverse humour is funny, and i feel sure it will make you laugh ... just not as often as it should.

no wonder so many young people have attention deficit disorder. it seems that stage (dance) productions these days are all about how many cameras and camera angles a director/ editor can squeeze into a 1 hour show. is there a special emmy category for this feat? try counting them sometimes for something different to do with this, otherwise, completely unwatchable show. i tried to make out at least a few faces of some of the other dancers in the production. that was impossible. they didn't appear to have any faces, just blurs - it was just michael flatley's face, michael flatley's bare chest(nice sheen!), michael flatley's feet, and that patented flatley over-the-shoulder-come-hither look repeated infinity squared. since he was an executive producer of this cut and paste job i guess that was to be expected. one doesn't have to wonder too much as to who his target audience is. riverdance was a much better production, as it tried to present the show pretty much as one might see it from the audience, not the catwalk,side wings, or floor nail perspective. if i'm not mistaken,i believe sir michael has retired. thank god for small blessings.

the production values in this video are so poor that it is unwatchable. the performance took second place to the overwhelmingly creative hijinks of the studio wanks, with about thirty special effects per minute. it is filmed through a cloud of smoke, only one or two seconds duration per shot and frequently, background spotlights shine directly into the camera. the lighting was terrible for filming. there is constant zooming in and out with a total lack of visual continuity. there may have been some good dancing available to the live audience but the video viewers will never know.

a klutzy young man returns west after being schooled in the hotel business via boston; he quickly learns his friends in spanish-colonized old california expect him to fill his deceased father's shoes instead--that of a romantic thief known for kissing his female victims after robbing them. colorful but silly m-g-m production has a great deal of talent before and behind the camera, but it never takes off. this might have been fun, second-string material for abbott & costello, but frank sinatra looks lost and embarrassed in the lead. combination of raucous comedy and musical interludes are hindered by the poor staging (sinatra is photographed singing at one point in a mirror, but one doesn't concentrate on his performance so much as noticing how odd the star appears reflected in this way!). kathryn grayson is the governor's daughter who falls for frank, and her high soprano trilling turns her singing scenes into self-parody. aside from robert surtees' cinematography and the decent art direction, this "bandit" remains kissless. * from ****

this must be one of mgm's and frank sinatras worst films. an oddball musical comedy that fails in almost every aspect. silly plot has sinatra trying to carry on his fathers reputation as a kissing bandit. he's no bandit and doesn't kiss!! he does play the "nerdy" character as well as could be expected given the dialog he has to speak. the scene stealer's are j. carroll nash and mildred natwick. too bad they didn't have more scenes together. i've given the film two stars because the sets and costumes are superior and one of the songs sung by kathtren grayson "love is where you find it", is sensational. could have had a repirse of that one. also, a comic type dance number by ridcardo mantalban, cyd charisse and ann miller if fun. so for those reasons and those reasons only, it is watchable. kissing bandit is part of the frank sinatra early years collection.

perhaps the director was trying for another pirate (good garland and kelly musical) -- but this lame musical epoch falls flat. sinatra and kathryn graysons voices do not blend well -- and their chemistry together lacks spark. the premise of sinatra as a sweet guy who tries to impersonate his late "bandito" father is okay, but he seems awkward in the role. what's amazing and wonderful here, is how sinatra can take a rather insipid song and make it seem special -- his phrasing and eloquence as a singer make you want to hear it again. when grayson sings the same songs it's hard to believe she's not singing something entirely different and not nearly as interesting. she has her big moment with "love is where you find it" which suits her perfectly and shows off her abilities. the photography is lucious and both stars look appealing as do the costumes and sets. co-stars mildred natwick and j. carroll nash put lots of energy into making the impossible work. aside from sinatra's singing there is a strange menage-a-tois dance with ricardo montalban, cyd charisse and ann miller. it's fascinating and weird. montalban and charisse were a wonderful dancing team and this number is a real oddity.

the kissing bandit was the third and final film that frank sinatra and kathryn grayson co-starred at mgm with. the first two were anchors aweigh and it happened in brooklyn. and in both sinatra wooed and lost grayson. i guess the third time's the charm.for romance maybe, but definitely not for screen image. sinatra in his forty's films once again plays the nice little schnook only this time in toreador pants. poaching on tyrone power's territory laid out in the mark of zorro, sinatra plays the son of a man who was a hotel owner by day and the kissing bandit by night. he's gone and left california for an education and has come back ready to take dad's place, but in the hotel business only. and where does he learn the hotel business, boston.of course some of dad's former gang members, grown a little old and paunchy led by j. carrol naish, want him to lead the gang again. but frank's just not cut out for the outlaw life. but he does make a good impression on the governor's daughter, kathryn grayson.somebody must have had it in for sinatra at mgm to cast him in this after the bad reviews he got in miracle of the bells. frank's in a part that was more suitable for red skelton. but since this was a musical, i guess the brain trust at mgm figured kathryn grayson had to have a singing co-star.in fact the best number in the film are for her, love is where you find it. also ricardo montalban, ann miller, and cyd charisse do a dance specialty that is nice. frank's songs are nice, but nothing spectacular.in later years, sinatra would wince at the mention of the kissing bandit and with good reason.

german emigree and uber-hambone actor paul muni who never saw a scene he didn't want to chew up goes "blackface" to play a humble mexican immigrant living in los angeles and working his way up in the world. if this creaky vehicle reminds anyone of al pacino's minstrel performance as an uncultured cuban in the remake of scarface, don't be too surprised. the characters are quite similar, and both get wildly pop-eyed when the script calls for it. hispanics everywhere should be greatly offended by muni's over-the-top performance as this giddy mexican living the american dream, consequences be damned. i guess benicio deltoro's grandfather wasn't available. a young, bleached-blonde bette davis plays one of muni's love interests; she eventually goes insane for love of mr. meh-hee-can muni. an absolute hoot, davis is the sole reason to watch this racially offensive claptrap. there is an absolutely delirious near the end when muni asks the gal of his dreams to marry him -- a white gal of breeding with one of those stilted, stage-like '30s accents that hollywood loved so much -- and she calls him a savage and a brute, of "a different tribe." muni immediately transforms into mr. hyde and chases her to an untimely death. in the final scene, a repentant muni tells his sober-faced priest that he is going back to his own people, his own kind. end of movie. finis. that's all she wrote. muni was said to have hired a gen-oo-ine mexican as a chauffeur in order to study this exotic creature's speech pattern and physical habits. yowza!

paul muni and bette davis overact monstrously while lacklustre studio hack archie mayo seems distracted and oblivious in this racially provocative film that derives its "bittersweet ending" by condoning segregationist attitudes. heavy handed and poorly constructed the film collapses under its own weight within the first fifteen minutes with an out of control courtroom scene that it never recovers from as mr. muni begins to chew up scenery by the yard hollering and howling away in an almost incoherent fashion.johnny ramirez is a mexican american from the other side of the tracks who through determination and grit attains a law degree from a store front night school. in his first big case involving an auto accident he displays only ineptitude and is quickly made to look the fool by his well heeled opponents and an impatient judge who recommends he be disbarred. devastated by the setback an angry johnny takes on a job at a gambling joint where he is befriended by the owner charlie roark (eugene palette) who likes his style. the owner cuts him in on the place but problems arise with mrs. roark (davis) who also wants a piece of johnny. she kills charlie, implicates johnny and slowly goes mad before he is acquitted and free to be with a high society wasp who coldly explains to him that they are from "different tribes, savage" and it will never work. when she flees to escape his rage she is run over and killed by a car. ramirez sells the casino and moves back to his poor neighborhood rationalizing that its best to stay with your own.in addition to this appalling denouement bordertown has a series of bad performances to compliment the overall ugliness of the story. unfair as his plight might be, muni's ramirez is so abrasive and arrogant it becomes hard to show sympathy for such a bull headed blunderer. davis is no better as the less than loyal wife matching the same adolescent emotions of muni. her lady macbeth mad scenes give no indication that she was about to become the best film actress of her era. margaret lindsay as muni's american dream is cold, remote and flat.bad as bordertown is (and it is very) it remains an interesting indicator of the times and acceptable attitudes. the rest is just a mishmash of bad acting and uninspired direction.

i fail to see how anyone who has actually read the m. didius falco mysteries could make such a mockery of them. an aussie has no business in ancient rome. nothing of the books is in this film except the setting and characters, and they are wasted on a plot thin enough through which to read the silly script. kevin connor and lee zlotoff have a lot of nerve displaying their names in the credits.

i hate to comment on something i didn't finish, but if i spare one person what i sat through for almost an hour before turning it off in disgust, it will be worth it. i decided to watch this with an open mind, knowing it was on the bottom 100.bad idea. i usually love crude humor, or can at least tolerate it. i love so-called "black" comedies. i'm not easily offended, either. it started off okay and quickly went downhill. i laughed a few times (for example, when the main character got stuck in the airplane toilet), but that was it and didn't compensate for the strong disgust i felt.i didn't laugh when the dog got sucked into a jet engine. i usually can't see the humor in animals dying (except in animal house). i didn't laugh at much else of the nastiness, either. i turned it off after an incident involving a blind man and a baked potato that i don't care to repeat the details of, only that the wave of nausea still hasn't passed over me. simply put, it was smut-filled and simply not funny with barely any plot. this is one of the times when if you don't have something nice to say, you should get the word out.don't say i didn't warn you.

i wholeheartedly agree with greg in ontario. i saw this movie today with a friend who actually went to the theatre manager afterwards and told him "that was possibly the worst movie i have ever seen." i have seen a lot of movies with this person, and he's pretty forgiving, so i was actually shocked. (the manager gave him a free pass!)i was offended by much of the humor in the film (yes, the baked potato scene was on the top of the list!). my friend and i are white and saw the film with a primarily black audience. for awhile i thought, maybe i just don't get this movie because i'm white. then i realized no one was laughing. the writing was bad; the direction was bad; the timing was almost non-existent.there were a few funny moments, there was just way too much time between them. even airplane two was funnier than this, and that's saying a lot.i was so dazzled by snoop dogg in starsky and hutch (as huggy bear) that i felt i was sure to enjoy this movie. nope.dl hughley was funny, as usual, but his role was rather small. tom arnold had a few funny moments as "the white guy", but most other attempts at humor fell far short of the mark.sadly, i was not able to award this film a rating with negative stars.

after a humiliating experience on an airplane, nashawn wade (kevin hart) sues the airline and uses the money he wins to start up his own full-service airline. what makes his different is that it has sexy stewardesses, an on board dance club and no less than captain snoop dogg in the cockpit.soul plane is a very racist comedy except it is only occasionally funny. soul plane has been described as an "urban" version of airplane. the problem is that soul plane doesn't even come close to achieving the laughs of airplane. the jokes in soul pane are too offensive and they are mostly unoriginal. i would be lying if i said i didn't laugh since there were some funny moments. however, i was expecting more and i left the theater disappointed.i would compare soul plane to airplane 2. the latter was just a rehash of the first film while the former is just a rehash of outdated, crude jokes. there is really no creativity behind the movie and there are only a few fun spots. however, i don't think soul plane is "bottom 100" bad. right now, the movie is ranked at number 82 and that's a little harsh. i'm not saying this is a good movie but it isn't a terrible on either. the running time is only 86 minutes long so it isn't too much of a pain to watch. for stupid comedies, you can do a lot worse.no one in the cast is very good but they all seem to be having fun and this helps. kevin hart was very annoying as nashawn. he had a few funny lines but he is a very poor leading man. snoop dogg, who was mildly funny in starsky and hutch, completely flunks here. tom arnold was actually tolerable and that was the film's biggest surprise. the most annoying person in the movie was ryan pinkston. he was not funny at all and he will never be funny. the funniest cast members were missi pyle and mo'nique. they gave the best lines and they made me laugh the most. in the end, soul plane may fit the bill if you're looking for a stupid comedy but it would probably be better if you just skip the film. rating 4/10

somebody decided to make a "black version" of airplane.somebody decided to make a really, really bad "black version" of airplane.somebody decided to make a really, really bad "black version" of airplane that ran out of humor after the first twenty minutes.somebody decided to make a really, really bad "black version" of airplane that ran out of humor after the first twenty minutes and instead spent all of its time insulting the intelligence of the audience and the cast.this movie managed to violate the laws of physics by sucking and blowing at the same time. if nothing else, it deserves to be remembered for that accomplishment.it's not a black thing, it's not a white thing, it's just a bad thing. a really, really bad thing. picking it apart point-by-point would be a waste of time. the best thing that can be said about the movie is that there was a purple airplane in it. do yourself a favor... go buy a picture of a purple airplane, and you will have gotten the best of what this movie had to offer.this one definitely goes under the category of "what the !^@@&*! were they thinking????"

having watched all of the star trek tv series episodes many times each since the 1960s, most being quite good to superb, and only very few being mediocre, my opinion is that this one is the worst of all.in fact, i think it's so poorly executed as to be an embarrassment to the series. it's not that the story is so bad, although it's not particularly outstanding in any way, but the acting is just abysmal on the part of the two lead characters, meaning those other than the regulars in this case. barbara anderson gives her weakest performance ever as the daughter of a mass killer, and who is on a mission of a sort. she practically calls in the role from a phone, and shows no real emotive abilities here. although usually she's never used as more than a pretty face in most of her film/tv roles,usually small parts, she has done much better.arnold moss as her father gives new meaning to the term 'ham' and is the only actor ever on a 1960s star trek episode that outdid william shatner in this area, and actually makes shatner look superb by comparison. and he gets to play a shakespearian actor no less, which gives him more impetus to overact, and he does so.other than these two leads being so weak, the story is such that anybody with any sense at all can tell who the killer is within the first 15 minutes. i say this because i told my brother the whole plot ending at the first commercial break when we were watching the original 1966 broadcast as pre-teens. his reply was, yeah, you're right.skip this one and watch the much superior menagerie episodes which were originally televised right before.

this movie is very scary with scenes where the devil uses gabriels horn to open heaven and pull the good angel-dogs out and imprision them on alkatraz. the devil sings and dances to a few songs about the joys of being bad, and at one point, eats a live rat.we got this movie free with a pizza. you get what you pay for.

... because this is yet another dead one. lifeless voice acting, second-rate animation, contrived and un-funny songs (although the bit sung by the devil would have been worthy of tim curry), and a weaker plot than land before time 99: fossils on parade.i have to admit, i haven't seen the first film. i'm not a big fan of movies involving heaven or dogs, especially not in combination. still, i hope to see the first one soon, as there had to be a reason someone would create such a god-awful sequel.if i didn't get this movie for free, i wouldn't have it at all. for a 'heaven' flick, the only good thing in this was the devil. 2/10.

this movie definitely made me laugh but that doesn't mean it was exactly funny. well, then again, me and my friends had a lot of fun watching it.i doubt there is anything about this movie that hasn't been done at least twice before, just like the plot itself. all of the characters are overused movie cliché cardboard-box roles that don't even require acting skills; accordingly, such skills are not delivered. we have the corrupt cop, a ruthless killer who claims to care about his men and their families whilst caring nothing about people he shoots in the forehead at so close a range as to have blood spat on his face. we have the "worn-out cop on the edge" so nicely pointed at in the discussion boards of this movie; we have the old one-day-away-from-retirement-cop who just about everyone must have immediately identified as the most likely man on the inside, since he had most to gain and he didn't utter a trustworthy word throughout the movie. about as see-through as a glass house on a sunny day. the big black gangster king was a copy of all previous big black gangster kings in movie history (they could've just called him marcellus wallace), but just slightly tougher and more ruthless, because something has to emphasize that we also know laurence fishburne from actually good movies. then we finally have the highly educated doctor who can't think of anything reasonable to do as soon as the situation differs from her ordinary life and who spends the majority of the movie sitting in a corner helplessly trying to figure out how to hold on to the weapon she was given. not using it.the whole siege story is not interesting, not original (having been used twice before), and this movie manages to add absolutely nothing interesting to it. there is the initial probe, then the laying of the siege, then the assault, then the escape attempts. meanwhile a bunch of strained, stressed, freaked out cops and thugs manage to hold off a police assault team with high-tech equipment and the quite important advantage of vision. then again, in deep night, with the power cut and with a snow storm raging overhead, there is definitely a lot of light coming in, so who really cares about night vision.but the best part comes right at the end. in the first scenes showing precinct 13, we see it is situated in an outskirt of an industrial city; factories and office buildings surround it on all sides. from this point, the besieged walk maybe a hundred meters in a sewer and where do they end up? some alley ending right in the middle of a forest! a forest! where did that forest come from? who decided to lay a pine forest in the middle of an industrial area? how is this forest, in the last scene, suddenly on a hill over the city in question, while in the scenes inside the forest it looked deceptively flat?? from here i leave the judgment to you, and to your common sense. go and see this movie if you're looking for an unintended good laugh, i can really recommend it.

that is what this movie is. good god the special effects suck in this movie. it is difficult for anything to suck more than this movie's plot, but the special effects manage to pull it off. let me try to explain just how bad this movie is.first, there is the plot. there are four punk-ass teenage dirt bikers who are riding around in a forest in duluth, mn. one of them is a dumb-ass and tries a ridiculous jump and breaks his leg. a paramedic comes to help him, but gets stranded with them when the helicopter breaks. then all five realize that there is a forest fire, which we see is started by some guy dumping tons of gas all over the forest. all they show us is his boots, and they show scene after scene of this guys boots walking around dumping gas and starting fires. meanwhile, the teenagers try to escape the fire, only to find that boot man has somehow managed to get ahead of them (while they were speeding through the forest on dirt bikes!), dump gas all over the area they were riding through, and start more fires. he does this several times, and the paramedic finally catches him and starts him on fire. i won't spoil the ending, but this guy's resilience will have you shouting "what the bloody hell?!?!" at the screen. anyway, they are now surrounded by fire, and their only escape is through a mine which is filled with methane gas. yes, methane gas. i'm not even going to try to describe the ending, because it is too ridiculous, and you'll enjoy it more if you don't see it coming. which you won't, because you can't possibly expect what happens. this is because of the second major problem with this movie: consistency.is some semblance of consistence too much to ask for? apparently so. i cannot even count the number of broken limbs in this movie (they keep breaking arms and legs while crashing their bikes). i think each character breaks at least one limb, and several more than one. they then limp around until the scene ends, and then forget that they're supposed to have broken limbs. there is one scene where three of them who are supposed to have broken legs start dancing. but then their injuries suddenly return when the plot needs them to.finally, the cgi. if there is a hell, it consists of watching the fire in this movie. all they did for the forest fires is line the dirt paths with cgi fire. you can clearly see that the only cgi fire is along the paths, and all of the trees more than two feet from the path are left untouched. and then they zoom out and show the whole forest being engulfed in flames. it's hard to describe in words how ridiculous it looks, but i assure you that the ridiculousness is quite impressive.this movie is one of those so-bad-its-good types. there are some occasions where it descends into the painful-bad category, but for the most part it stays above the line and is laughably inept. i can't wait to check out the other nature unleashed movies that came in the four-pack with this one.

ah the sci-fi channel. how often do you disappoint me? quite often i think, do you ever show good movies? ok you have given me the great 'heroes' and the reasonably good 'the lost room' but they are series, and as for the movie well there really is nothing positive to say. bad acting, bad directing, terrible characters and a shallow story, and that is just for starters. i checked out the director allan a goldstien and was not surprised to find nothing of interest in his resume (in fact i am half thinking that this is a pseudo name). the premises of four motor bikers out motto-crossing in a national park when one of them has an accident that needs a park ranger to come rescue them only for them to get caught in a forrest fire is weak and predictable that you know every beat before it happens. leading man bryan genesse the park ranger is so bad it is terrible. cast as the action hero martial arts boy in the footsteps of so many others this guy makes seagal and van damme look like de nero. the supporting cast are little better and well before the end one was left hoping the fire would engulf them all then the film crew. avoid at all costs

i thought it will be a ok movie after seeing the commercials about it. it was funny at some parts and some very nasty. the only person i felt sorry for is horatio sans who got a hot wife who is cheating on him with other women. but he never got a chance to have a threesome with until the and that was good but they should have made more bigger thru out the film.

this movie is one of the worst i've ever seen. even being hangover didn't help. the plot is lousy, if existent. the relatively large number of beautiful girls are unable to help. i guess seeing an episode of temptation island with the sound turned of would give the same kind of experience. do not see this flick

the guidelines state that a comment must contain a minimum of four lines. that is the only reason i am saying anything more about tomcats. because after all, my one line summary really says everything there is to say. there is absolutely nothing remotely entertaining in this film.

this movie, quite literally, does not have one redeeming feature. the characters are one-dimensional, cliched, incredibly misogynistic and stupid. the script looks as if it was cobbled together from 100 other movies, the acting is horrible, and some of the 'gross-out' humour made me feel nauseous.shame on you, gregory poirier, for thinking any of this would be funny or interesting!the worst movie i've seen in several years.

rare and auspicious are the moments in film-making when greatness stands as a defining monument for the rest of the industry to measure themselves against and for us to immerse in that glorious moment.some stories transcend their time and aspire to the lofty reaches of a classic and the stuff of legends. throw in the refined skills of an ensemble cast of thespians who are at the very top of their game."where has all the originality gone?" it is here, as this story and it's cast sashay through a plot and story that will not only educate but also entertain even the most seasoned of shakespearean/action/love story connoisseurs.i cannot begin to imagine where the writers dreamed up this extraordinary tale. where do geniuses get this kind of inspiration? i now have hope for mankind, knowing that this kind of talent still exists gives me hope that we will make it to the stars and beyond, perhaps to the very gates of heaven.i have, like others before me, dreamed of greatness. though i did not write this movie i did see it and because of this movie's noble greatness, i feel as if i have been elevated to a higher level of being, a higher level of spiritual wholeness.it is no wonder this kind of glory eludes most of us. what would become of our world if we all could attain this level of magnificence? we would probably be consumed in a white fire of super-nova glory as we evolve into trans-dimensional spiritual beings capable of omnipotent creative power.the most important thing to know, with all your heart and the very essence of your being, is that "tomcats" is nothing like what i have been talking about. "tomcats" is the antithesis of all i mentioned. it could very well destroy our world. for as some reviewers rate a movie on a star system, i.e. 1 through 5 stars, or even zero stars, i'm going to rate "tomcats" a black hole.i am willing to donate money to a cause that will put a stop to these kinds of atrocities that, as of late, seem to be running amuck at box offices. i'm not even adverse to the use of nuclear weapons. it must stop. how much more of this can we take before aliens from outer space come down here and blow up our planet because we have so many stupid, crass, vulgar, unimaginative, and degrading movies spewing out of hollywood? i'm not even going to dignify this movie by mentioning anyone's name that starred or produced it. i'm not even going to waste my time describing the story, since we've seen it a ba-zillion times, and all of the past versions were at least a ga-zillion times better.by the way my head nearly imploded during this movie, but with supreme selfless effort and lots-o-luck i survived to warn the public. you have been warned.

if you want to see someone accidentally eat another man's testicle, or look at a row of pathetically fake hard-ons at a wedding, or listen to a man talk about how good it felt to have sex with a girl while she was throwing up, then this is the movie for you. alternating, in neck breaking fashion, between romantic and gross out comedy, tomcats is certainly interesting. the lovely jaime pressly plays the wife of horatio sanz(tell me another one) who is found in many silhouetted situations with other women, but there is, surprisingly, no nudity. jake busey is thoroughly revolting as a hound dog who you wouldn't want as your friend. shannon elizabeth and jerry o'connell are both good and make a convincing couple, but the movie is far too busy trying to disgust to be any good.

here's the spoiler: at the end of the movie, a little piece of you dies. you'll spend the rest of your life searching in vain for that missing piece, but it's gone, it's gone. you'll wander the streets at night peering into your neighbors' windows as they sit down for dinner. friends and family will try to pinpoint when exactly you turned into the walking dead. you'll answer their questions and concerns with a blank stare and some mumblings about a runaway testicle. when amc inevitably makes tomcats the "movie of the month," a series of mysterious murders will take place in your city. you'll wake up the next morning balled up on the floor of the kitchen with a faint taste of brains in your mouth. then you'll crawl into the living room and onto the couch. you'll stare at the wall, wet yourself a little and then begin to laugh maniacally. because once your dead inside, jake busey in a thong is actually pretty damn funny.

horrible, misogynist drivel. my neighbor brought this turkey over, subjected me to it, and didn't have the courtesy to apologize. the plot was laughable, my four year old could write a better movie.

this is movie is garbage, it looked really funny on the previews but i didn't laugh once through the whole movie. do yourself a big favor and don't waste your money on this, don't waste anyone's money on this. i gave it a 1/10 believe me i would have given it less if i could have. i'm a 15 year old guy and i thought it was trash if you wanna see a good movie go out and see jay and silent bob strike back.

right then. this film is totally unfunny, puerile, has gags from other films, has songs from other films (blink 182's "mutt", grand theft audio's "we luv u"), an unlikeable leading man, a ridiculous plot, and lame parodies of films like mission impossible 2 and american beauty. redeeming features? shannon elizabeth and jaime pressly. enough said.

highly flawed but just about watchable `comedy' that runs like a farrelly brothers reject. the most criminal thing about it though is the casting. i couldn't for one minute believe jerry o connell and jake busey in the role of superstuds, who could pull any woman at the drop of a hat, nor could i believe (the very beautiful) shannon elizabeth as a streetwise tough cop!. story is predictable but does manage to raise a titter on a few occasions, although, the `gross out', meant to be `shock comic' scenes, (one involving an amputated testicle, and another set in a sperm bank) are just plain awful. if this film is on tv then its probably worth watching if you are extremely bored, but please don't waste your money renting it!!

what can you say about a movie whose funniest episode sees a fat man wrestling a garden hose? the acting, particularly that of lead man jerry o'connel, is embarrassing. the dialogue is so contrived and unfunny it makes you cringe. the controlling idea is actually not a bad one for this genre (infantile teen comedy), but, somehow, the director manages to make the least of it. i rate it a 2 out of 10.

i mostly rented this movie to see shannon elizabeth. she played well in this movie, but the plot sucked. the movie wasn't really about anything just about trying to stay single after making a pact when one of jerry o' connell's friends gets married. the other friends put together this money and who's ever last to get married get's the money ($10,000) from all his friends. anyway the movie just try to follow through by making no since and trying to make it more funny then making since. i'm glad i only paid .50 for this movie. it really wasn't good at all. i rated it **** out of 10 stars!

i had expected a fairly straightforward r-rated graphic, sexual, crude teen-comedy when i sat down to see this... it turned out to be fairly accurate... only it was far more sick and disgusting than i would have thought. i don't know if the director/writer gregory poirier is sick or deeply messed up sexually, but i doubt that a normal person could have made a movie like this. i could probably have taken it if it was just that, if the only thing that was wrong was it was that it required a tough stomach... but it isn't. the film is also horribly mean-spirited and disturbing... every single character that has more than one full second of time on-screen is an extreme... sexually, mentally or physically. i don't know if this is just the director's sense of humor, but i just found it to be... wrong. just wrong. even in a comedy, there is supposed to be some seriousness. the plot is stupid. the acting is bad. the characters are inconsistent and poorly written... all of them. there isn't one single likable character in the film. the humor is disgusting and goes way too far. the film is just so incredibly poorly done that i really don't think it's worth anyone's time. if you like r-rated, crude comedies with plenty of sexual innuendo and graphic stuff, watch the groomsmen, or, better yet, american pie... or road trip, my personal favorite. but don't watch this. i can't possibly describe to you how bad it is... you would have to experience it for yourself. however, this is one of those times where i'll say that you're better off wondering. that way you can just imagine that this film goes very close to the bottom... without knowing that it goes through it, and far lower than that. this movie most of all looks like a group of horny teenage guys got together, put together a film crew, and every-time one of them got an idea, they filmed it, and later put the entire thing together. it lacks structure, consistency and taste. i recommend this only to horny teenage guys who have seen every single other r-rated crude teen comedy and who don't care about quality. everyone else... do the sensible thing; avoid this. it's not even worth it to see the booty. believe me. 1/10

** black dragons (1942) william nigh ~ bela lugosi, joan barclay, clayton moore "just prior to the start of world war ii, dr. melcher (bela lugosi), a world-famous surgeon, is brought in by japan's black dragon society as part of a secret plan. dr. melcher operates on six black dragon society operatives and transforms them into exact duplicates of 6 high ranking american businessmen who are replaced by these look-alikes. with their operatives in place, the black dragon society's plan to sabotage the american war effort appears to be set but, the f.b.i. chief and an agent begin to piece together the clues that hopefully uncover this sinister plot," according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis.that synopsis gives away the entire ending; which, in this case, might be a good thing. "black dragons" is an incredible, wildly inconsistent muddle. a wiser course of action would have been to stay with the teasing supernatural angle. in early scenes, mr. lugosi (as monsieur colomb) is effectively creepy. confusing joan barclay (as alice saunders), future "lone ranger" clayton moore (as dick martin), along with a cast of old stage and silent veterans do the best they can with a story that looks as if filmmakers were making it up as they went along.

when a group of businessmen start dying in the presence of the mysterious mr. coulomb, fbi agent dick martin is assigned to the case. as the deaths continue to mount, mr. martin obviously isn't having much success. by the end of the movie, the strange truth is revealed, which i won't reveal here.one of the other users commenting on this states "this is a classic film and should be enjoyed and not picked apart". i'm sorry but i have to respectfully disagree with this opinion. it is "classic" only in that it is old, not in any sense pertaining to its quality. i've enjoyed a lot of low budget "b" movies from around this time period, but this isn't one of them.the pacing is unbearably slow, the camera work is pretty bland, most of the acting is fairly wooden (even lugosi isn't great in this one in my opinion) and the plot, while it has an interesting premise, seems to be thrown together in a very difficult to follow manner.

first - nick-623, pearl harbor was bombed in 1941, not 1942. they didn't have to predict the bombing.second - did nobody notice these six industrialist/lawyers/whatever were missing for a rather long amount of time? they were killed *before* the surgery took place! third - how the heck did lugosi get out of cabs without being seen? fourth - why did the japanese not just kill him, instead of putting him in jail with a convenient look-alike companion and his surgical kit? fifth - oh, what's the use? this movie has a few interesting moments in it, but by the time they explain what's going on, you'll probably have stopped watching. if not, you won't care.

bela lugosi is a real enigma. in the early 1930s, he was on top of the world after appearing in dracula. yet, again and again, he made lousy decisions regarding his career. perhaps he had a bad agent, perhaps his drinking and drug use had a part in it or maybe he was just crazy. regardless, he ruined his reputation by appearing in pretty much any film--ranging from excellent horror films (such as the raven) to big-budget flicks (like ninotchka) to grade-z flicks for the cheapest and shoddiest of studios. interestingly enough, although he agreed to do this terrible film, he actually turned down the role that later went to boris karloff in frankenstein! as for this movie, it is a very silly an horridly produced wwii propaganda film that featured a dumb plot and wretched editing. lugosi spends much of the movie murdering saboteurs--not a bad thing at all. but at the end, we find out that he is himself a nazi plastic surgeon and all the american-looking men he killed were actually japanese!!!! the funniest part of this is during a flashback. you see lugosi talking to a group of japanese men before he changes them to american-like men. when the camera scans them, the men are clearly asian. but, on all the other non-close-up shots, they are all very western looking--many with bald heads!! they looked absolutely nothing like japanese men. i suspect the plot must have undergone a re-write and this might account for the obvious mistake. or, it could just be shoddy production values and editing. in fact, early in the film, they show a street scene in the city and all the cars (circa 1942) are old model t fords--obviously from stock footage!!! the bottom line is that the film is bad but also very dull. unlike plan 9 from outer space, it's hard to laugh at the ineptitude--just be put to sleep by it.

**spoilers** with the title of the film having the name of the killer fish twice not once you would expect to see them in action attack biting ripping and eating up almost everyone in the cast of characters. instead you have to wait until the movie is almost over for you to get as much as a glimpse of the piranahs. even then all you see is the water bubbling and stirring around as a poor individual disappears under it assuming that he's being eaten, whole and alive, by the fish.the movie "piranha piranha" starts with this scary looking piranha on the screen as the credits start rolling down but****spoiler****that's the only time in the movie that you ever get to see the killer fish or fishes you never get to see a piranha is the movie again. what you do see is a travelogue of venezuela and it's people and the venezuelan jungle along the amazon river basin. together with a lot of nice and breathtaking photography of the landscape as well as the people and wildlife but that's about all.there is some kind of a story that has to do with this great white hunter caribe, william smith, which ironically means piranha in the native language spoken there, is this what the title of the film "piranha piranha" really meant? "caribe caribe"! the person caribe is played by legendary hollywood hell's angles biker and all around tough guy william smith.at the beginning of the movie this trio of american tourists jim pendrake and his sister terry, peter bown & ahna capri, and their american guide art green, tom simcox, are on their way into the venezuelan jungles to go sight-seeing with terry taking photos to send back home. terry is terrified of guns as we learn that as a young girl saw her father get his head blown off by a gun. even when art saves her life using one when see's attack by a six foot long diamondback rattlesnake terry almost belts him for having a gun; which he promised her he wouldn't take along with him on the trip.at a jungle rest stop, or bar, the three run into caribe who we first saw catching monkey's in the jungle at the start of the movie. caribe makes himself more then welcomed by the three with his knowledge of the jungle and his half-baked philosophy about life and death as well as his ability to get them where their going to the local diamond mines deep in the amazon basin.even though a bit strange at first, the guy is so in to himself that he doesn't seem to notice that there are any people around him, caribe turns out to be a swell and likable guy engaging in a long and friendly motorcycle race through the swamps and jungle with art. caribe even shows terry, who at one time in the movie almost knocked his teeth out, the fine points of hunting and shooting wild game that he believes don't really die but become a part of him after he kills them! a bit crazy but you have to admit this guy's got imagination. it's much later in the movie that for some strange reason, maybe it was the cheap booze that he was drinking, caribe suddenly goes insane and become homicidal attacking and raping terry and then murdering her enraged brother and feeding him to the deadly piranha's. trying to escape from the rampaging lunatic and then being forced to have to fight it out with him art gets beaten up so savagely by the dirty-fighting caribe that he's almost left unconscious. just when caribe's about to finally kill art he's shot to death by terry who after experiencing what this insane nut-job is all about finally decided that guns are indeed very necessary and should be used to kill on very rare but life-saving occasions.worth watching, if worth watching at all, only for the scenery and nothing else. it's just a shame that the movie has to advertise as a killer fish, or piranha, horror movie when if it was honest about itself it could have been a more or less average jungle adventure flick with smith, he does have the build for it, playing tarzan of the venezuelan, not african, jungle

this is an example of a movie that can have great potential and is executed very poorly.. i am a fan of kids and thumb sucker and many other so called teen angst films, but this one bugged me.why is every white kid made into a thug who loves rap, its getting to be one dimensional. the acting was awful but simple since it mainly consisted of just dropping f bomb after f bomb just a bad bad movie if you'd like to see better movies like this : thumb sucker kids bully allthose i think are better so i recommend one of those is you'd like to see a good "teen movie" i hope my comment you found useful and hope you hear future comments from me

this movie was outright painful for me to watch. i understand that indie films do not have the same resources as other mainstream films. but there are basic elements of film making that typically you want to adhere to. first off, jump cuts. there are numerous in the film's opening 15 minutes. there are shots in which it appears that two separate takes of the same shot were edited together. what i mean by this is a character will say half a line from one take, and the rest of the line is from a different take. secondly, the dialog. i understand that many writers strive for a very realistic and true dialog for their films. since this film is very specific to its location, the dialog must be spoken in a specific tone also (example: set a movie in boston, yet people use west coast slang with a chicago accent). even with understanding this, it is still hard to sit through some of the lines these actors present. these are only the two most vivid problems i encountered with this film. there were a few others. i do not mean to sound like a harsh critic who doesn't know a thing. i have years of experience in the film (more importantly the low budget indie film) industry. i also understand that with many directors there is often a method to their madness. i have been unable to discover this method used in this film. this makes it difficult when trying to decide whether i view this film as an example of unique style in film making, or just another low budget, poorly put together film. i honestly hope that it is not the latter. if anyone has any insight into why things were done a certain way, or has any thoughts/views of their own concerning this film, i would love to hear them. hopefully i can understand this film more and my current opinion can be changed.

i caught this during a brief run in a philadelphia theater. despite its local provenance (and its relation to a hometown tragedy, namely the beating death of eddie polec in 1994), i really have to come down hard on this movie. the director, for reasons best known to himself, decided to shoot the entire film guerilla-style, with nonstop handheld cameras and rapidfire cuts. such technique might work for the scenes of jarring violence, but is utterly inappropriate for the rest of the material, which makes up the majority of the film. a stroll down the sidewalk, a brother-to-brother discussion on a sofa, hell, even a kiss on a first-date are all shot cusinart-style, distracting this viewer from ever being able to enter into the drama. martin also undercuts his narrative by packing in far too many topics: besides the birth of mob violence, we get anorexia, alcoholism, divorce, racism, parental abuse...did i miss anything? no doubt a better cast (and a better-focused direction) would have knit these threads together, as martin surely intended, to demonstrate how one moral flaw leads into and sustains a host of others...but good intentions do not necessarily a great film make. just a sprawling mess. martin, i know you're from my town, and i'm down with you man, i really am...just do a better job next time, like you did in two plus one.

this movie just happened to be on hbo yesterday so i watched it. this was a mistake. i guess i got sucked in and kept watching although it was a lot like a train wreck, terrible, horrible, but somehow you just can't look away. shaudenfraud i guess! ; ).this is the story of a photoshoot for models on some island in the caribbean. one by one they are all murdered. one drinks cleaning fluid, one gets blown up on a waverunner, one goes over a cliff...so these are not accidents, but for some inane reason the police are never called and no one thinks that perhaps they should "wrap" the shoot and go home, not just in respect for the dead, but perhaps out of fear for their own lives. no. they just continue with their shoot because that is what's most important. forget about the dead models, we have a magazine to produce!one of the subplots is the evil magazine owner, played by lee majors, rex is his name. he is the most obvious suspect and every time a model gets killed he twirls his mustache and says "well, i can't say this won't be good for sales", mooo hoo hoo hoo ha ha ha ha". so absurd. another subplot is when it's revealed that rex is one of the models baby dady, only when he learned of the baby he tried to convince the girl to abort. she didn't, but always resented him for even suggesting this.they try to give you false clues and point toward some guy named raule, seemingly because he's the only one with an accent and "looks creepy".at the very end (sorry to spoil, but this movie came out years ago so if you haven't seen it by now...) one of the women was found face down dead in the pool. this was the last straw!!!! vanessa angel, forget her characters name comes at rex with a gun, they struggle, the gun fires and now she's dead too!!! while she's laying on the floor his business associate tells him that with all this bad press the magazine will be worthless and it's all his fault. he gets him to sign over the magazine to him. once he does voila! all the dead models come back to life and you find the entire thing was an elaborate ruse to get back at rex.oy! what a ridiculous movie. as someone else said; if you want to see something like this april fools day is far better!

so you've got a number of models on an island, and one by one they're picked off agatha christie-style. we get somebody lost at sea, pushed off a cliff, poisoned by a solvent, driven off a cliff, blown up, etc. nothing terribly graphic.before any of that starts, one woman inexplicably has a dream of a killer in a weird human face mask.the owner of the magazine is a sleaze who had an affair, and somebody had photos taken of her before she was of age.in the end, it's all about business, or something,there's an 80s style montage of a photo shoot, most of the bathing suits being one-pieces, surprisingly. a couple are fairly translucent. there's camera clicks during the montage where the frame of the camera appears as a white square or rectangle within the picture. the photographer is rather bad at framing!

"terror in the aisles" might look like the ultimate treat for horror fans but it has, in fact, very few to offer. granted, it presents a decent and versatile (too versatile?) selection of horror/thriller fragments that are considered classic but ...what's the point? this documentary primarily aims for the horror-loving public so we've pretty much seen all these clips already, haven't we? the only thing really praiseworthy about this project is the editing. if you're into scream-queens, chases by vile murderers and that sort of things, "terror in the aisles" has some neat compilations of the most famous sequences. all these different scenes hang together by a lame wraparound story starring donald pleasance and nancy allen sitting in a movie theater. in between two sequences, the address the viewer and "explain" why we love horror so much. those speeches naturally are soporific and rather obvious (it's in our nature to be afraid ...bla bla bla) and i fail to understand why many people love the concept. this is worth a peek in case you're a loyal horror fan but it certainly isn't essential viewing. on the contrary: in case you still have to see a classic genre title, beware that bits and pieces of it here don't spoil your future viewing. the main reason why i overall disliked it is because it shamelessly ignores a lot of lesser known, but fundamental (foreign) titles endlessly focusing on "halloween". this does result in a cool inside joke, however, when donald pleasance screams to the screen at his own character.

i used to think that "it came from hollywood" was the worst movie i had seen that showed clips from horror, sci-fi, crime and drama movies. of course, i hadn't seen this beauty yet.what's wrong with "terror in the aisles"? four things:1) it assumes that most of the great moments in shock cinema history began in the '70s when directors like john carpenter and brian de palma came along. and what bones are thrown to the true classics (i.e. - the black and white films) like "frankenstein", "dracula" and "the wolf man" are either shown with martin and lewis or abbott and costello alongside or not at all!2) the clips are most times so brief and out of their originals' place that they just give a momentary shock to the viewer and, for those unfamiliar with these films, will make no sense at all (indeed, the moment where the shark jumps out of the water at roy scheider in "jaws" is shown much to the effect of a sight gag. whereas, in the original's context, it had power.)3) did we really need pleasance and allen in the audience reminding us that "it's only a movie" or that most of the violence in the horror movies "is, sadly, against women"? so, is that an indictment against the movie-makers for adding those scenes or the movie-goers who tromp into the theaters and watch the same kind of fodder time and again? sorry, that's a whole can of worms to open for a more deserving movie.4) and most importantly, why is the movie so short? it isn't like there wasn't enough of these kinds of movies to use. if they had just opened up their resources and used every available film, they could have had a "that's entertainment!"-style movie that would have been comparatively more entertaining. heck, even drag out christopher lee and peter cushing (cushing was alive then, mind you) and better yet, even vincent price would have been more than willing, i'll bet! what a cheer that would have gotten from the audience!but no... all we're left with is a dreary little flick that pretends to pay homage to these movies but all it does is leave the viewer feeling cheated out of less than 90 minutes with which they could have went and watched a real movie. don't get me wrong; it was good to see what clips they did show, but if they could have just done more with the goods!two stars. another good idea left laying "in the aisles".

pointless and pretty silly film that is just basically a compilation of clips from horror, science fiction and suspense films. there are unnecessary shots to an audience watching the clips and donald pleasance and nancy allen are among audience members who turn to the camera and explain why we love horror films. not a bad idea but all the explanations are obvious ("movie horror helps us deal with real horror", "you are at the mercy of the filmmaker in a theatre") and pretty trite. also the clips are shown very quickly and the changes are kind of jarring. and, shown out of context, these bits aren't very scary at all. and it's real short--i saw it in a theatre back in 1984 and was outraged that i paid $5.00 for an 84 minute movie!still, it is reasonably well-edited and allen and pleasance seem to be enjoying themselves. for people who have an interest in knowing more about terror this might be fun and interesting. but if you're a horror fan (like me) you'll probably be bored silly. good idea, bad execution (no pun intended). i give it a 3.

if this was nominated for a screenwriting award by the wga, a professional association of screenwriters, then it's time to hang up the word processor. astonishingly inept writing, direction, production, at every level, even for a tv movie. no cliche goes unexploited in this jaw-droppingly bad movie. what were they thinking? does anyone really believe kids are stupid enough to watch this?

maybe the target audience of this disney channel tv-movie will be pleased with it, but if any parents are watching along with the youngsters, they will clearly see that "cranked out" is written all over this production. obviously it was no one's dream to make this movie, but rather, this was concocted in a board room somewhere, then produced with cold efficiency. there is some talent among the cast, but actors like dabney coleman and jay thomas don't get much of a chance to showcase their talent. the impossibly cute elisabeth harnois is engaging as the first daughter, but will friedle is stuck once again playing another dumb character, though he's not nearly as moronic and annoying as in his "boy meets world" role. the background for this movie is washington, d.c. and the white house, but there is no real "presidential" feel to the film and the secret service is made out to be little better than the keystone kops when it come to doing their duty. the disney channel presents a lot of original tv-movies and most of them are better than this.

this movie isn't that great...at all but it's good when you want to just laugh, because it's pretty ridiculous :) there are a lot of mistakes in it and it's cheesy. i got this movie for christmas like 5 years ago but for some reason i've never given it away. i guess i just like it for a rainy day even though i only watch it like once a year. this is a very 90's movie so it's really funny to see how everyone dresses and acts. this movie is good for someone young...although come to think of it, i didn't even like it much when i was like 12 but that's just my personal opinion. the movie was really predictable. i wish it had had some extra weird twists but i guess it was trying to be an appropriate movie for everyone to enjoy. i think it was appropriate for the whole family but hallie's dress was a bit unmodest but certainly appropriate enough for family material.

five fingers is so bad, that i hardly know where to begin. so let me admit first, that i have only seen the first half hour. when the first finger had been chopped off, i thought sleeping a more useful activity. i told my girlfriend the meaning of "five fingers" and she immediately followed my example.couldn't the producer, the director and/or the scriptwriter consult a chess-amateur? like me? they should have used a digital chess-clock and not an analogue. this major goof makes the mental pressure put on martijn just a laugh. how, when and why did martijn date a moroccan girlfriend? such an affair is very rare in the netherlands.calling me a retard is of course an insult to all those people suffering with a much lower than average iq. moreover, as far as i know, retards don't play chess. i do.the biggest problem is the script of course. just compare the little intelligent movie hard candy. to keep the spectator in a grip, the information must be revealed bit by bit. a nice twist now and then also helps. i understood from other reviews, that there is a big one at the end of the movie. any smart person can guess what it is. this of course just raises more questions - why is the travel guide killed? oh my, why should i even care? the whole movie focuses on just one thing: the chopped fingers. the makers have not even learned hitchcock's lesson: it is thrilling to get a bomb exploded. it is more thrilling to show that bomb ticking. but no, we don't see the paper-cutter until the impossible countdown is over. i will not waste more words on this crap. go see hard candy.

boring movie. poor plot. poor actors. the movie happens in a room supposed to be in morocco but actually in some american city! the "arab terrorists" are the patriots the blonde patriot is the "arab terrorist"...damn!there is something good about this movie though (that's why the score is 2 out of 10). the director turns the ridiculous stereotype about terrorism the media feeds us every day into the real thing, the terrorists are americans (or western people if you like).the movie is divided into two parts. the first part of the movie concerns the dutchman travel (15 seconds) while the second part is about the staying in the amazing dark brown room (1 hour and something).the dutch guy is going to deliver money in morocco to some "charity organization", gets off the plain, takes the bus and ends up kidnapped in a dark brown room. he is kidnapped with another guy that is shot after telling "they will not shoot at us". the dutch survivor is forced to play chess with a morpheus-like arab guy for so long that you'll learn how to play chess too! at the end the dutch guy reveals his plot not because they cut four of his fingers off but because he is tricked by such a lame game you should watch the movie for!good when you are so tired you can't sleep.

"son of the mask" is a terrible excuse of a movie. i went to see this with my friend and i still wish we had seen "because of winn-dixie" instead. i must say that it is partially my fault, as i agreed to go see it with him. being a fan of the first "mask" movie (jim carrey was hilarious) i had hoped it wasn't as bad as all of the critics said it was.ten minutes into the movie i knew it was headed for disaster. disgusting and pointless attempts at being funny got little seven and eight year old children shrieking with laughter, but the rest of us were left staring at the screen in disbelief.finding the movie as repulsive and unfunny as i did is surprising to even me, as i loved "scary movie" and "anchorman", two films which many people i know found crude and offensive. but the thing is, "son of the mask" is not funny unless you're under the age of ten.the film features lots of cgi in it, but it cannot save this piece of rubbish. whoever allowed this movie to make it to the big screen was probably thinking it had potential, considering the success of its original. unfortunately, it has none of the laughs, fun, or excitement of the first, creating a mockery of the original movie. i recommend renting the original "mask" to anyone who is thinking about seeing this one. 1 star out of 10 is generous to this awful mess.

son of the mask is a terrible movie. i don't like the baby and i don't like the dog. jamie kennedy and his wife are a cute couple but that can't redeem sitting through this garbage. even at only 88 minutes (or so it says), the movie could not end soon enough for me. the only real laughs come at the beginning with a brief appearance by ben stain. that's it. the rest is just a rehash of the first movie. actually that is just an insult to rehashes. why was this sequel made?? this movie cost millions of dollars to make. why would i sit through a movie with a baby and a dog intentionally trying to drive the dad crazy? jamie kennedy is talented but he has nothing to do in this movie. i am not bothering to be nice to this movie. 1/10

-so the weak excuse for a story in the generic waste of time involves a guy that wants to be an animator but can't get his career of the ground. his super hot wife is more successful and she doesn't seem to care that he's a loser but the man isn't satisfied with that and wants to make more out of his life. one day their dog brings them a magic mask that changes his life. unfortunately for him, the god loki is looking for his magic mask and once he finds the man with the mask he tries to get it back and that's the whole story. if that sounded exciting to you then someone needs to throw some water on you to wake you up -this movie is terrible. there's really no other way for me to say it and i just can't stretch it enough. the only good thing about the whole thing was the woman that played jamie kennedy's wife who was hot but apart from her there's is nothing about this movie that is worth watching. i know it's meant for kids and that's why it's so idiotic but what about the adults that have to take their kids to watch this trash. why do we have to suffer through this vile vomit sack of horrid crap. the original mask was a very good movie that had a great mix of comedy and great story telling. this one is a lame attempt by hack filmmakers to cash in on the franchise and judging by the laughable bo gross i'm guessing the franchise won't go on any longer.-the cinematographer needs to be beaten severely because the sugary colors of the movie will make you feel like throwing up. if there was music, i didn't pay attention to it because i had already punctured my eardrums to prevent myself from hearing the horrid dialog. then there's the acting or at least what passes for acting nowadays. you could watch an infomercial and see much better acting in that than the one in this movie but i can't really blame the actors since it's the director who deserves the blame for apparently not realizing that the actors needed to do another f**king take. if new line is looking to start a franchise with this then they need to up their game by hiring writers that can actually write and stop thinking that the audience will watch any crap that comes out -bottom line if you're a sadomasochistic and you love torturing yourself then please by all means check this out because it is painful to watch but if you're not and you actually like to watch movies that are good then avoid at all cost

this movie isn't worth going to the theaters to watch, i did and i didn't like it, the effects on the movie are really well done, and you get a laugh here and there, but the story is really bad, it seemed like they had run out of ideas, and what is that of loki and odin getting along? that totally destroys norse mythology, and i guess they forgot that loki's powers only worked during the night!! if you really must see this movie rent it when it comes out, don't go to the movies for this!they could have done a lot more with this than they did, it felt like they just wanted to do a movie to show off cool animation and effects

despite a totally misleading advertising campaign, this flick turns out to be an irritatingly clichéd, sub-par haunted house flick with a totally implausible ending. clue #1 for all considering seeing this turkey: sam raimi didn't direct it. although commercials for the movie play up his involvement, in truth he is one of four producers. it's too bad that someone as talented as raimi has allowed his name to be used in conjunction with such a poor movie. i don't think he would ever have directed something like this; that task was left to the pang brothers.the screenplay for this film seems to have been cobbled together from numerous other "horror" films, so you'll find absolutely zero original content in "the messengers." what we get are a scene here and there that was plucked straight out of "pulse," a couple that could have come from "the birds," one or two from "the others," etc. nearly every scene, almost every line of dialogue, is one that has been lifted from any number of other movies. the whole thing makes for such a predictable movie that almost anyone will be able to figure out the "surprise ending" long before it comes.right about here would be a good time to point out that the advertising campaign, centered on the idea that only children can see ghosts, has nothing to do with this movie. in fact, everyone can see the ghosts. the teenage daughter and mother characters certainly see them, even quite early in the movie. i'm sure that whomever was in charge of marketing came up with this campaign because the film needed a unique angle to have any box office appeal, which otherwise is entirely absent. now you know, so don't be fooled! perhaps what this movie lacks most of all is anything resembling chemistry between the actors. it simply isn't there. all of the interactions come across as awkwardly stilted. coupled with the hackneyed story and ridiculous plot holes (just what is a guy who murdered his whole family doing still lurking around the small town where the murder happened, anyhow? didn't anyone think to maybe arrest him?), it all adds up to a profoundly unsatisfying ghost flick that only manages to surprise anyone over the age of ten with cheap shots: loud noises, visual flashes, and anything short of a sheeted figure jumping out of a closet and yelling "boo!" all we get for our buck this time around is yet another poorly-made film about spirits attempting to warn people away from a house. if there's any message that "the messengers" delivers, it's "don't waste your time on this movie."

this movie has all the ingredients of a great horror story and loses it in the last half. few movies can actually give me chill bumps. this one did. few horror movie give me a sense of dread. this one did. it kept me guessing. i cared about the story. i cared about the characters. the acting was decent. unfortunately, about half way through the movie, the story just doesn't have many good directions it can go. it becomes evident that everything cool about the plot is going to self-destruct. it does. what builds in the first half as a great horror concept shifts away from horror and towards the absurd. a plausible fear turns into a series of implausible reactions from the characters. the story concludes with disappointment. while this movie seems complete, there is one loose end that could setup for a sequel. the movie isn't good enough for a sequel. this movie is worth seeing in the theater, just don't expect to be stunned. this is best suited as a movie to rent. it's probably not a movie you'd want to own.

i'm no jane austen purist but why make a film like this if you have nothing to say.billie piper was so wrong for the part it is difficult to know where to begin-wrong personality,modern make-up,completely wrong hair (there is no way a young lady of her age would have romped around in public with her hair loose and unbrushed like that),she didn't seem particularly meek nor put-upon by the family and i didn't understand why everyone seemed to think of her as particularly saintly or kind.the picnic(substituted for the ball) was so low-budget it was embarrassing to watch and missing out the portsmouth section completely destroyed the point of the piece (as well as losing scenes which could have added a gritty counterpoint to that oh-so-claustrophobic pink sitting room.)to those responsible:-if you haven't the imagination (even the budget doesn't matter so much as the imagination) to do something meaningful with an adaptation please don't pretend to be producing jane austen.it was about 10% mansfield park and 90% nothing much at allps edmund was very good

oh dear! the bbc is not about to be knocked off its pedestal for absorbing period dramas by this one. i agree this novel of jane austens is the difficult to portray particularly to a modern audience, the heroine is hardly a elizabeth bennet, even edmund is not calculated to cause female hearts to skip a beat. however i must say i was hoping for an improvement on the last and was sadly disappointed. the basic story was preserved, but the dialogue was so altered that all that was jane austen's tone, manner, feeling, wit, depth, was diluted if not lost. if some past adaptions may be seen as dated the weakness of this one must be that it is too modern ('his life is one long party'?????) the cast was generally adequate, but i think billie piper was the wrong choice, it needed someone more restrained, i gained no impression of hidden depths beneath a submissive exterior, she was more like a frolicking child. i see i must wait for the bbc to weave its magic once again.

well, this latest version of mansfield park seemed to try and take the edginess of the 1999 theatrical version (outright copied some of the ideas from it in fact), but tone things down a bit to bring it more in line with the original story. unfortunately, the result is a rather lackluster, and schizophrenic, production. and, as with all the other versions of mansfield park out there, the character of fanny price is no where to be found. instead there is a strangely child-like, bleached-blond woman running around who never really fully develops as a character. at least in the 1999 movie the character they call "fanny price" is firmly established as rebellious tomboy who is too clever for her own good. this "fanny price" is a complete enigma. someday, i would really like to see a dramatization of mansfield park that actually includes a depiction of the character of fanny as she was written by jane austen. a sweet, kind, compassionate girl with a timid personality and frail constitution. she is reserved in manner and painfully honest, but also strong in her convictions, unfailingly loyal, extremely intelligent, and remarkably astute. a bit of a late bloomer, it is not until her eighteenth year that she finally begins to make the transition from awkward adolescent to self-possessed young woman. and she wants nothing more in life than to be of some real use to those she loves most. it's a wonderfully complex character that i look forward to one day seeing faithfully portrayed.

i doubt whoever wrote this screenplay has ever actually read mansfield park...or if they have it was not very well. none of the characters are what they should be: fanny is lively and conscious of her mistreatment, while sir thomas, who treated her very well, seems to have accidentally fallen into aunt norris' personality. additionally, a first person narrative by fanny is highly inappropriate to both the story and her character. fanny is not an entertaining heroine, and i would contend that she is not meant to be. additionally, in the movie version, fanny flirts shamelessly with edmund from the very beginning, when they have been raised as brother and sister! austen's fanny would have shrank from flirtation of any sort, and the novel paints the fanny/edmund pairing as highly uncomfortable...as it should be. unlike some other jane austen novels (p&p, emma), mansfield park does not rest on the strength of its female protagonist. it is a very different sort of novel than the others; it is not meant to be a love story. i watched this movie because i have just now finished reading mansfield park, and i am absolutely horrified by what i see; miss austen is rolling in her grave.

i watched 40 minutes and couldn't bear it any longer  the television went off and i returned to some light reading "lobotomy for beginners".it was hard to say what aspect of this production was most displeasing - dialogue made up entirely of sound-bytes or the acting by numbers.it was difficult to determine the period in which the drama was supposed to take place. there were throw-away references to lord nelson and slavery but edmund, the cleric-to-be, played by blake ritson was the only actor who one could believe inhabited the early 19th century. the other bright-young things had make-up and costumes more appropriate to a 21st century fancy dress party - the bleached-blonde fanny, billie piper being the least credible character.uk commercial television obviously believes heaving bosoms, pouting lips and deep meaningful looks make a good story. fortunately jane austen had other ideas.if you want to find out the story of mansfield park, buy the 1983 mini-series dvd.

the good news for imdb is that this movie was so very bad that it compelled me to register and make a comment. i should add here that i'm a film buff who rarely passes harsh judgment. but sometimes a movie is so poorly acted, poorly conceived, poorly edited, with a such a poor story line that it begs criticism.i'm surprised by all the claims of how superb, brilliant, dark, and beautifully shot this movie was. i can only conclude that the cast and crew are active posters here. the acting was extremely thin. the pace of the movie was agonizing. i gave it new chances at every turn (mostly because i didn't want to feel like i was wasting a saturday morning in ny), but with every new scene, it dragged longer, delivering characters in which i took no interest, with which i could not connect, for whom i could not empathize.when i see negative reviews on imdb of small independent films like this, i sometimes wonder if the poster has a personal axe to grind (something like. . he used to date the gaffer, she dumped him, and now he's going to trash everything she ever works on). but here, nope. i know no one who worked on this film. and i wish it would have been great. but the film wasn't dark (as some have mentioned) or depressing (as others have claimed). . . those suggest that i connected with the film . . . nope, henry may long was just too long, empty, and tedious. that's the tomas take on this one.

on the plus side this does contain interesting information over a wide range of topics, particularly concerned with himmler, the ss and their research branch. it also has some good piano music, some interesting footage and some excellent camera work.however it is a very poor piece of historical work. it has no clear aim to it and the entire thing could be summed up as follows.himmler set up a department in the ss for research into the origins of the german race. they went all over the world. they did some things and launched expeditions to all manner of places... (nonoe of these avenues were explored, the results were not shown and the arguments were barely refuted). they wanted to establish that the aryan race and the german people were one and the same thing through historical proof. they didn't find any. the members of this research group were leading professors, members of the ss and therefore linked to the holocaust, and were seen as ok after the war and went on to lead german institutes.these facts in themselves are fascinating but they are never explored in depth and no coherent argument is presented in the program that either condemns these people or exonerates them. nor does this seem to be the aim of the programme, the aim of the program is unclear, it hops from topic to topic. the witnesses, though presented as credible, are few and unsupported.sadly this programme does not know where it is going or why and fails to impress. the topics are fascinating but this program tries to take on a huge area of research and consequently appears to not know what is going on. i would avoid this.also the 'holy grail'is the german bloodline, nothing to do with the holy grail of christian mythology except in passing. mentions of expeditions to look for the christian holy grail are made but never followed through. the title is misleading and the content of this documentary unconvincing and incomplete.

a very, very, very slow-moving, aimless movie about a distressed, drifting young man. not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience, nearly half of whom walked out. attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles, the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent. very little music or anything to speak of. the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head. he goes to a used record store to buy it for his lover and has to sing the song for two sales clerks before they find the album. cute scene gave promise, but it went downhill from there. the rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning... if it's about emptiness, it works i guess because it's empty. wasted two hours.

a terrible deception: controversial film, winner of the teddy in berlin 2003, mil nubes de paz turned out to be a fiasco. the actors are all reciting (well, they are not exactly actors); the film tried to be a high bet but ends up being a doubtful bet: it stays in the superficiality of two guys kissing and a guy whose lover is gone; it has no purpose: nothing to do with the homo-sexuality presented in other films (e.g. before night falls (2000) by julian schnabel). technically the only thing that works is the photography; otherwise, the camera is put in strange angles (to make it more `art-film') and the whole film runs in a black and white atmosphere. the film is so pretentious that bothers. i mean, it's good to be pretentious when you have talent to support it. or maybe it is that it's so art-cinema that it's incomprehensible. the story flows slowly, slowly, slowly. to me, more form than essence. superb edition? it was good. superb direction? don't think so: the film is weak. it was an interesting project. it's a shame. it's a flaw. one star out of four.

it's astonishing that some people saw this as art. we saw it as a poorly filmed (shaky hand-held camera and all), (generally) badly acted, unscripted mess that seemed more like a high school film project with the kids experimenting in black & white film making. injecting mounds of poetry in place of a story does not an art film make. when we watched this in the theatre, people were starting to have fits of the giggles (us included) at the endless stupidity of this self-indulgent, meandering mess. and believe me, it does seem endless. had we finished our candy and popcorn, we too would have walked out of the theatre with the other two dozen people who packed up and left looking for something more interesting to do!

but even caricatures need a plausible plot line. i suppose in 1934 some part of that audience long ago would enjoy this tepid farce. it doesn't age well. it does give nat pendelton and zasu pitts experienced and expert support players a shot at leading roles. pendelton, who is featured prominently in the thin man series tries his best but is over matched by witless plot. with the backdrop being a stage play with gangsters its not exactly original material. movie's saving grace is the always excellent edward everett horton in a wasted performance. but don't waste your time watching everett in this film. i would encourage anyone to watch him in his effort in holiday, with cary grant and katherine hepburn. same era 1936, but much better script and storyline. better gags and needless to say star power as well.

surely one of the lamest shows ever to be produced on these shores and thats saying something. even many of the lead actors didn't stick around for the duration. the fact that it ran for eight years is a sad indictment on the average intelligence and cultural nous of the aussie viewer. it went round and round in circles, with repetitive gags and poorly-drawn characters. arthur macarthur, for god's sake. did they actually pay the writers of this show? i wonder if anyone checked their qualifications. there were tired gags about rural people and second-rate farce situations that were poor imitations of a thousand english and us sitcoms that had gone before. i think that's what i hate about it so much, that it appears no one involved wanted to make it memorable, original or clever, instead opting for the lowest common denominator each time.

while the david lynch version of dune is choppy, awkward, and unfaithful to the novel, it is visually well designed and well acted. the best one can say about the sci fi channel's attempt to make dune into a miniseries is that it's ambitious. actually, that is virtually the only positive praise one can offer. the actors (with few exceptions) seem happy to recite their lines with the least emotion possible, and the least appropriate accents. the costumes seem to have been designed by someone with a a large surplus of mylar fabric on hand and an unhealthy love of unflattering headwear.in part, this miniseries suffers from living in the shadow of lynch's already well known effort. however, it takes elements from lynch's film which were not present in the novel and copies them nearly wholesale (i.e. the guild steersman's navigation sequence), and this only encourages encourages negative comparison to lynch's film. a for effort. d for virtually everything else.

if you have never read the classic science fiction novel this mini-series is based on, it may actually be good. unfortunately, if you are a fan of the book, you probably won't be able to watch more than the first hour or two. all of the political intrigue has been taken out of the film, the most important scenes from the book have been taken out, characters motivations have been changed completely, and words from the wrong characters mouths. where in the novel paul atredies was a teen age boy with incredible political skill and a great understanding of the way the world worked, in this film he is hot headed and and frustrated. avoid this movie at all costs.

this is a total piece of crap. it is an insult to the awesome book by frank herbert. they have mangled the story and characters. the acting is average to bad. the only character done right and played well is duke leto, played by william hurt. unfortunately, he dies pretty early in the story and then its all downhill from there (not that its a very tall hill to begin with).the 1984 movie was directed by the legendary david lynch. i was not overly impressed with the movie, but considering the technological limitations of the time, they tried their best. amazingly, the crappy mini series makes it look so much better by comparison. it was at least somewhat true to the book, which i really love. they had the chance to do it right this time, sadly it was not taken.

the dune miniseries opens with a "flashforward" montage of action sequences. the realisation quickly dawns that these are the *best* scenes out of the 265 minute running time, and they're not good. not good at all. oh dear. but let us not judge a book by its cover (even though that's exactly what we're being invited to do). let's give dune a chance to redeem itself.well, here's the expected watery opening on caladan. but who's this petulant, strangely ugly man? paul atreides? *this* is paul atreides? this generic plastic puppet? and why does he look so old? what's that? the actor's only 25? well, he doesn't *look* it, and that's way too old anyway.but at least he has charisma, right? wrong. alec newman is a stumbling, mumbling buffoon. i'm picturing him being discovered sitting in the dark in a remedial acting class because nobody liked him enough to tell him the class was over, and he's just too dumb to realise it. when your paul atreides has all the screen prescence of soggy toast, and an acting range from "petulant" to "blank" your production of dune is doomed from the start.the other actors take pity on poor alec though, and give uniformly insipid and incomprehensible performances so that he doesn't look too bad by comparison. at least, i *assume* that is what they are doing. because i'm charitable, you see.to be fair, they are clearly being given no direction at all. random gestures, blank or inconsistent deliveries, missing their marks, it's all here. this is like a master class in how not to do it.and sure, there are more elements of the book in this miniseries than there are in the 1984 movie, but there aren't twice as many, because of all the. pauses. to fill. time.but we can forgive all this because of the small budget of $20 million, or only $5 million per hour. nobody could be expected make quality science fiction on that sort of budget.except perhaps "stargate sg-1" which makes do with $1.4 million per 50 minute episode, or "farscape" at $2 million. and frankly i'd rather watch four episodes of either of those while being punched in the kidneys, than have to sit though the travesty that is dune the miniseries again.

what can i say? after having read herbert's books and loving lynch's movie version, i was extremely disappointed. i felt i was watching a reject version of buck rogers. the sets looked like left overs from a star wars tv special! i felt the acting was a bit amateurish by most. the costumes were garish and over done which gave it a '60s flash gordon, pulp feel. the worms! they're supposed to be sand worms and yet they appeared to "big stalagtites" with a mouth at the blunt end. the effects in general were pretty second rate. i won't even start about the disgraceful "navigator" effect.this so-called "frank herbert's dune" wasn't even faithfull to his books! it should have been called "frank herbert's dune - for dummies". key plot elements were left out, names were changed and the entire "feel" of the story was "sanitised". i didn't even recognise the harkonnens! in fact most of the characters appeared nothing like herbert's descriptions had depicted them. i'm starting to get upset just remembering what a tragedy it was. i'm glad i couldn't stomach the second installment....

drivel. utter junk. the writers must not have read the book, or seen david lynch's film. not worth wasting your time.longer does not make better. while more in-depth then lynch's film, it has gross in-accuracies, and down-play's key parts of the story."a night at the roxbury" is more worth your time.

this is the "battlefield earth" of mini series. it has with a few exceptions, all the disastrous ingredients that doomed that movie and will follow it to the grave in the turkey cemetery. they are both adaptations of books with a endless amount of pages who has been turned to a complete mess by a script writer and a director (in this case they are the same person.) who clearly don't know what they are doing, they have both a messiah wannabe that don't really deliver, as a hero (played in this case by a guy that looks like mark hamill but sadly the force is not with him.) and a bunch of stupid bad guys who likes to betray and mess up the life for each other, they are both containing scenes stolen from better productions and they are both cheap productions who tries to look expensive with some (often badly made) computer animation. the exceptions that actually makes the whole thing worse is the terrible work made by the lighting guy who don't even have the skills to turn on the light in his own living room, the camera work that for no reasons at all sometimes are in tilted "battlefield earth" mode but for the most of the time are flat as a pancake, the extremely cheap and to small desert set that only contents a pile of sand in the front of a backdrop painted as a desert, that turns very old very fast because it appears in almost every scene, and the bad idea by the costume designer to try to mimic "the fifth element"'s fashion madness with the addition of the silliest hats ever made. silly moments to remember: 1. every scene with the guild guys, who looks like mst3k's observer guys but with silly hats. 2. irulan shows up at the party dressed in her butterfly dress (why butterflys? -was the one with stuffed parrots in the cleaner?) with matching silly hat, together with a couple of guys with silly balloon hats. 3. paul the stand-up comedian. 4. baron harkonnen in over acting overdrive, screaming "i,m alive". 5. every scene with the backdrop, because it newer fits the foreground 6. every scene with the fremen's fake religious cermonies, specially the "water of life" cermony. 7. the battle scenes where the same guys gets killed a couple times and the same things explodes over and over again. it is a lot more but it is a 1000 words limit on this so i better stop before i gets carried away.

that's a weird, weird movie and doesn't deserve a better mark than david lynch's one! the special effects are badly made, the actors are majorly bad actors and in this movie it's not about a race which is the minority of a planet and tries to fight against the dominators, but it seems to be a crazy movie, which pays homage to sect kind of organisations. that's surely not the will of frank herbert, the author of the six part epic! check out david lynch's one, that's the perfect tribute to the novels!

i looked forward to watching this film since i loved the david lynch version. in my first attempt at watching it i fell asleep. nothing was happening. the next night i tried to watch the rest, and again it was putting me to sleep! nothing ever happened in this movie that could keep anyone's interest alive. the only time it got a bit more exciting was when i tried it on fast forward! the dvd came with a second disk which contained bonus material. needless to say, i had no hard to go through the torture of watching more of dune (2000). here are the low points: the acting was bad, the plot moved in slow motion, the sets were and looked cheap, the direction was pathetic, and the cgi visual effects childish.if you want to watch dune, save your money or rent the 1984 version.

this miniseries/movie was so terrible at times that i nearly broke down and turned it off. i am a great fan of the novel, however this movie suffers from multitudes of problems. the costuming is poor, and many of the more emotionally charged scenes are blase. the departures from the novel are poorly chosen, significant nuances are missed or rewritten.

i agree in many parts with the fairly thorough review already posted on the subject of the miniseries, and agree that it does have its pros, not only its cons. for example, the original film manage to truncate much of the middle and final sections of the novel into a single montage, including the discovery of gurney halleck and the love affair of paul atreides and chani, which, on reading the novel, is a travesty, probably born of the studio cutting shenanigens of which the other reviewer writes. this was one of the great failings of the original film, and the miniseries, to its credit, does include many of the original plot lines that were cut out of the lynch film due to the expansive nature of the herbert novel.however, this in itself is a double edged sword. rather than complete a text-to-celluloid transfer of the novel, the creators of the miniseries were tempted to create their own plot lines, absent from the original novel. similarly, although this is surely a "fuller" account of the storyline of dune, it is also a break from the originals heart and soul & main vision - that of prophecy. where are the internal monologues that characterize herbert's writing and demonstrate what the many different characters are thinking, without the need to suddenly switch viewpoint, or expand in words or unnecessary and stilted spoken monologues? gone. so much of the original agony of paul's decision to choose the jihad or death, the choice to fulfill the prophecy or swing away from it, surely the most interesting aspect of the novel itself (and one which captivates people who are far from science fiction fans) is missing. without prophecy, what is the point of dune? it is simply a more educated and learned version of farscape or andromeda. how sad that this is all we are provided with. lynch's film was flawed, yes. but a flawed film could lead to a correction by another film-maker, taking on some of the best points of lynch's film-making and rejecting some of the more overblown aspects of the style whilst restoring the storyline. now this story shall probably never be translated to film again, and this i find heartrending.

"the apartment complex" is a campy comedy full of kookie characters created in lieu of a real story which tells a young psych student (lowe) who takes a job managing an apartment complex and becomes embroiled in a murder mystery...um, if you can call it that. this low cal watch contains no suspense, no thrills, no drama, no action, precious few funny moments, a dash of nudity, and almost no romance. "the apartment complex" is passable, forgettable junk food for only the most needy couch potatoes.

i sat through this on tv hoping because of the names in it that it would be worth the time...but dear gussie, whoever thought this script was worth producing? the basic idea is excellent but the execution is appallingly bad, with a constantly illogical sequence of scenes, an ending that is almost laughably melodramatic and poor rock hudson wanders through this with an understandably confused look on his slightly sagging face. looks like a bad b movie from the 40's...

i suppose i'm supposed to take something like this with a grain of salt. these laboratory movies (and, yes, they spend a lot of time in the laboratory), always fail in one dimension: there is an understanding that single people fooling around have uncovered secrets beyond the comprehension of anyone to this time. of course, they pay a price because their experimenting has the same shortcomings that dr. frankenstein's did. there is always something they didn't anticipate. there are so many things from pure science to fashion for young ladies to outrageous cover ups that don't work here. the young woman is certainly fetching and the doctor can't help himself, but he could have been a little bit discreet or even made an effort to shelter what he was doing. things go wrong and because of this intellect, she gains tremendous power, including an understanding of how she came to be. rock hudson looks pretty fit here. he never quite makes it in this role, however. it wanders all over with lots of clichés and silliness which diminishes the basic issue. once she has her revenge a more suitable thing would be for her to wander off and allow him to seek her out and destroy her in some grand way.

rock hudson's second venture in the science fiction genre after seconds is embryo a film that combines elements of the bride of frankenstein and pygmalion in one rather weird film about for lack of a better word a test tube baby that grows up to be barbara carrera.hudson is scientist experimenting in organic development and gets a chance to first experiment on his own doberman pincher when it is accidentally hit by his car. some pituitary secretions from the female dog are given to a prematurely born puppy and it grows remarkably into an adult. exalted with his success, hudson takes a fetus from a dead accident victim and gives it some of the same stuff.what he gets is barbara carrera. and she develops physically and intellectually at a prodigious rate. what she doesn't do is develop emotionally. still hudson passes her off as his new research assistant to friends and family like sister-in-law diane ladd, son john elerick, and daughter-in-law anne schedeen. embryo doesn't explore some of the real issues in this kind of science, it exploits them instead. the special effects as they are, are pretty second rate. hudson looks like he lost interest in the project about halfway through the film.now what would have really been interesting is if he had gotten boy child and it grew up to be a harlequin novel hero. now that would have been something rock hudson could have sunk his teeth into.

after his career as a romantic leading man ended in the late 1960s, rock hudson starred in lots of different projects, including tv shows and lesser films. however, i believe that "embryo" is his only turn as a mad scientist, and that's probably a good thing. i guess he needed the work.driving along one dark and stormy night, brilliant dr. paul holliston (hudson) hits and injures a doberman, which he brings back to his lab (that looks somewhat like a dank midwestern basement). he then manages to raise the dog's unborn puppy outside the womb, so naturally he decides to do the same thing with a human being. he raises victoria (the beautiful barbara carrera) from a fetus the same way. victoria grows at an astonishing pace, and soon blossoms into a gorgeous young woman.predictably, things go very wrong. after a halcyon beginning, holliston's sister-in-law martha (diane ladd) begins to wonder where the young woman came from, and victoria herself begins to show signs of instability and violence. the final sequence is one long car chase straight out of "smokey and the bandit", after which victoriawho has shockingly aged in just a few minutesis assaulted by a frantic holliston, who tries in vain to destroy his malformed creation along with its unborn child. all of this is accompanied by screeching tires, roaring engines, a car fire, and lots of sirens. the limp endinga bunch of paramedics frantically working on victoria while holliston writhes in regretis more labored than creepy.although just made in 1976, this movie is very dated. the only difference between this and the many 1940s mad scientist movies is that hudson plays the lead role rather than boris karloff. the sets are pretty cheap and very antiquated to today's audiences, to the extent that hudson's reel-to-reel tape recorder is about the size of a refrigerator. much of the action takes place in a poorly lighted laboratory. hudson sleepwalks through his sordid role, giving the impression that he's truly a washed-up movie star, while ladd and carrera are much more believable. surprisingly, roddy mcdowall pops up briefly as a chess player.the passport video transfer is very substandard, looking as though it had been made from a poor vhs copy using home equipment. if you're nostalgic for 1976, watch this once just to say you did. otherwise, watch a football game or soap opera instead.

although embryo could have been a potentially thought provoking examination of bioethics, it degenerates into a stereotypical frankenstein parable, putting across the by now monotonous lesson that there were some realms man was not meant to enter or study.scientist rock hudson is experimenting with ways to prevent miscarried babies from dying. after success with a dog, he immediately jumps to humans-violating medical ethics and any sense of plausibility-with the equally unrealistic assistance of a hospital administrator. his experiment works too well, with some decidedly unpleasant side effects.although barbara carrera is reasonably good in her role, and some of the animal training is spectacular, the film suffers from being too fantastical. even though a message at the prologue assures viewers that this represents contemporary technology, the scientific work depicted looks far fetched even for the twenty-first century, let alone the mid- 1970s. furthermore, the scene where carrera is able to find a cure for the side effects of bioengineering simply by typing a question into a computer is laughable.

first and foremost i'd like to state - for the record - that it's incredibly dumb to call your movie "embryo" when the subject matter exclusively revolves on scientific research performed on fetuses (animal as well as human) aged 12-16 weeks. the embryonic stage is over at the end of the eighth pregnancy week and from that moment on the unborn critter enters the fetal phase. okay, in all honestly, i didn't know all this, but i took the effort of looking it up and that's the also the least thing the creators of "embryo" could have done. don't worry; i'm not just stumbling over details or being exaggeratedly bitter, as there are several more reasons to state why "embryo" is a huge failure. actual science can be considered as boring and inaccessible, and thus science fiction is a cinematic genre created especially to make the otherwise tedious, yet educational science topics more interesting and comprehensible to larger audiences. by depicting ambitious scientific experiments that go horribly wrong, or space missions that encounter evil aliens instead of light-years of void, filmmakers usually manage to entertain people with spectacular special effects and, at the same time, teach them useful little trivia about science. in order to make a good or at least halfway-decent science fiction movie, writers and directors only have to comply with one basic rule: don't be boring! if they can't fulfill this one condition, the viewer might as well read a theoretically accurate book. something must have gone wrong during the production of ralph nelson's "embryo". the basic premise is potentially fascinating and even involving, as we're all sensitive about saving the lives of unborn babies. there also were some very prominent names involved in the production, like main stars rock hudson ("giant", "seconds"), diane ladd ("chinatown", "alice doesn't live here anymore") and director nelson himself was responsible for the acclaimed classics "soldier blue" and "charly". then what went wrong? simple. the script is irredeemably boring, clichéd and the whole thing looks incredibly foolish because the lab scenery & scientific equipment is clearly too primitive to achieve any medical breakthroughs with. rock hudson, in a very poor performance, plays a doctor who hasn't put any passion in his research work ever since his wife passed away. when his car hits a pregnant dog on a rainy night, his passion returns and he does everything possible to save the dying animals' fetuses. he manages to keep one fetus alive, impressively accelerates its growth process and trains it to become an extremely intelligent dog. because his procedure is so successful, dr. paul holliston convinces his friend at the hospital to repeat his tests with the human fetus taken from the womb of a pregnant teenager who committed suicide. the female subject unexpectedly keeps growing at a fast rate, however, and after only a couple of weeks she's a full-grown, ravishing and super-intelligent woman. the good doctor naturally falls in love with her, but the groundbreaking new growth treatment also begins to show horrible side effects... absolute nothing happens during the first 45 minutes of the film, apart from a lot of implausible and overly melodramatic mumbo-jumbo and one or two deeply impressive tricks performed by the dog. that second half of the film does contain a little bit of (grotesque) action and suspense, but by then the stupidity of the dialogs and the implausible plot-twists already ruined the potentially fabulous sci-fi idea. there are some really cool scenes, most notably the chess-showdown between victoria and roddy mcdowall (in a highly memorable and ultra-obnoxious supportive role). the grand finale is absurdly grotesque and literally on the verge of ridiculous, and it almost feels like ralph nelson put in that final disastrous shot because it was the general rule in contemporary thriller & sci-fi cinema. the last sequence, including the horrible freeze-frame shot at the end, certainly doesn't fit the tone of the previous 100 minutes of the film. but anyway, my sincere admiration and respect to the dog and his trainers. an animal with such intellect and talent surely deserved to demonstrate its tricks in a much better film.

"a research scientist is experimenting with human dna in an attempt to create the perfect human being. his work has made it to the point where he can take a human fetus and accelerate its growth to that of an adult within a few days. his latest creation is a (spoiler omitted), but side effects from the process (spoiler omitted)," according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis."embryo" opens by promising: "the film you are about to see is not all science fiction. it is based upon medical technology which currently exists for fetal growth outside the womb. it could be a possibility tomorrow or today," according to dr. charles m. brinkman iii. right. and, dr. joyce brothers appears, later, at a party with roddy mcdowall.first, we see rock hudson (as dr. paul holliston) light a cigarette and drive recklessly (watch that speedometer!) during a storm; unfortunately, he hits a dog. mr. hudson takes the wounded canine home. he learns it is pregnant, and manages to save the life of one of the puppies, due to his experimental knowledge of fetal growth. what this really boils down to is that hudson uses an experimental drug to grow the embryo, so that it can survive outside the mother's womb. the dog, "number one", grows to adult-size rapidly, and is passed off as its mother.hudson lives with his sister-in-law diane ladd (as martha douglas); since his wife nicole, also a doctor, died in another car accident. ms. ladd seems more emotionally stable about nicole's death than hudson, who survived the crash that killed his wife. things begin to get creepy when hudson's dog shows an intelligence level far above any normal dog. then, hudson decides to use his accelerated embryo growth on a human, barbara carrera (as victoria spencer).hudson and the cast try their best; but, the "embryo" storyline is wretchedly absurd nonsense. if you take away her silly opening and closing scenes, ms. carrera's valiant characterization almost works; she might have been a bigger star, if offered better films than this. the infantile ending suggests a sequel; but, happily, the idea was aborted.

a buddy and i went to see this movie when it came out in 1980. it was playing in a huge theater and we were the only two people in the place. it lasted two days in the theater before they stopped showing it. it was so bad that we laughed all the way through it. since that time, we rate movies based on kill or be killed as the worst movie of all time. like other reviewers have mentioned, it is so bad that it is funny. it isn't worth a second look that's for sure. i just can't bring myself to give it more than a 1 because i don't think the makers of the movie intended for it to be so bad and i can't give credit for an accident. sorry.

master plan: have the winning team in a deadly tournament. one of several martial arts action pictures that attempted to capture the flavor of the famous "enter the dragon" from '73, this one is an effort from south africa. the villain's stronghold is a bit different, appearing as a white castle-like fortress in the middle of the desert from a distance. the villain himself, a baron or general, is a slightly more perverse version of the "dr.no" or han mold of master villainy, having strange flashbacks to the glory days of nazi germany. he does wear the full regalia nazi uniform at some points. his main ambition in life is to hold an illegal martial arts competition/tournament against his japanese rival, an extension of their complicity in the 2nd world war (my army is better than your army). it sounds silly and it is, though the suggestion of madness and crazed machismo almost works. the central hero, steve chase (ryan), resembles a white 'bruce lee' character, having a similarly lean, lithe physique, though obviously not on the same level of martial arts expertise. i thought he would be some secret government agent here but apparently not. he and his girlfriend have joined the baron's team of fighters, but decide to quit (what did they think they were getting into?). of course, it's not that easy. there's an odd sequence of them escaping through the desert using a wrecked car with a rigged sail - those desert winds can do wonders for travel, it seems.the plot kind of meanders in the 2nd half, as the hero joins the team of the villain's competitor and the girlfriend is held hostage by the villain in a cell, under threat of rape by the hero's rival. the most interesting character turns out to be chico, a dwarf who is the villain's assistant; he's loyal to the baron but is sympathetic to the plight of the hero. much of the fighting utilizes the ballet-like capabilities of the hero, with a lot of leaping and slow motion. the sound fx are also amped up and exaggerated in an attempt to add more impact to the blows. there are a few good fights during the tournament towards the climax, but none really stand out. if one had to pick, i suppose the best involves the brutish muscle man-henchman of the baron, introduced late in the story (he lifts the back of a car at one point). you wonder how the hero will take him out at the end, since the brute seems to shrug off most of the punches. the acting is very mediocre, descending into camp as far as the girlfriend, who tends to laugh for no reason, as if she's high on grass, though she is very cute. some of the training scenes are also campy, especially all those guys running over or rolling down the desert sands. and, with such a title, there's surprisingly few actual killings. ryan, as steve chase, returned as a traditional agent in the sequel "kill and kill again." hero:4 villain:4 femme fatales:4 henchmen:6 fights:6 stunts/chases:4 gadgets:2 auto:3 locations:5 pace:5 overall:4+

to be honest, i did never read one of the comics and cannot remember part 2 and 3 at all. i can compare to the first part (werner - beinhart) and this one here is really disappointing, compared to part1 as well as compared to most other movies i watched the last weeks. the first minutes seam to be just a needless clone of the first movie intro and then it is becoming even worse. there are a few good (funny) scenes, but in total it is just another boring second-rate try of german film industry that cannot succeed (nearly as usual). one good thing: the movie is quite short (75 min.) the bad thing: it only contains story and jokes for 45 minutes ;) -> don't watch it

having sat and watched this film i can only wonder at the reasons for creating the film. this was without a doubt one of the worst films i've ever seen and had no redeeming features.if it was supposed to be funny then it might have managed to be a very weak comedy but as an action thriller it was dire.slow, no plot, no real action, nothing approaching good dialogue and i've no idea about the characters. what else can i say. avoid.

i began watching this movie on t.v. some weeks ago, but gave up after the first 10 minutes or so. at the start, the person on the witness protection scheme located in an isolated farmhouse becomes nervous about his exterior placed guards, and then asks the guard inside the house whether he can make a telephone call - only to discover the line has been cut.shortly afterwards, roy scheider as one of the witness's assassins turns up and duly executes the witness and his wife - upon which the roy scheider character duly picks up the wall telephone in the kitchen, dials a number, and then speaks: it is done!!!! that was it for me!

directed by diane keaton and adapted from a book by franz lidz. a young mother selma lidz(andie macdowell)is battling a very serious illness and her self proclaimed inventor husband sid(john tururro)is a little lacking in the emotions department. unhappy with the new home situation, their sensitive son steven(nathan watt)decides he wants to stay with his two eccentric uncles danny(michael richards)and melvin(lou cutell)until his mom is well. steven seems to be happier and even takes interest in his strange uncle's living habits; he even decides he wants to change his name to franz. set in the early 60's, this drama is a bit comedic...change that to zany. not being a macdowell fan, unstrung heroes assures my attitude; albeit i enjoyed the film and it is not a total waste.

this feels very stilted and patronizing to a great extent. the whole plot is extremely forced - especially the "gallant" effort to save the college from ruin, and the moralistic overtone (especially by the leading lady) grates a bit.but there are one or two comic moments that do help relieve the boredom, and the dancing is quite fun (especially for alleged amateurs - ha, ha!)the shop proprietor and the young guy doing spectacular tap dancing were particular highlights. and i liked peter hayes impressions of charles laughton and ronald coleman as well.

the stage star grace hayes stars in this obscure little film. after years of being on the stage, she is going to visit a small college town to check up on her son who is being raised by his grandfather. the kid doesn't know who his mother is and when she sees him in a local malt shop, he's a boorish jerk. part of the problem is that he is a college clown the other part is that he's really spoiled.interestingly, it turns out that mom is really quite wealthy and has been not only funding her son's life but is a hefty contributor to the college. so, she has the idea of forcing the young man to mature. she talks to the man who's raising peter and has his allowance cut off completely--hoping he'll rise to the occasion. it also turns out that she puts the screws to the school because she thinks all these kids need to stop playing around and be more responsible.now here's where it gets pretty dumb. to show that they know the value of hard work, she hires a bunch of them to sing and dance at the malt shop she just purchased. talk about contrived!! what happens next is like a long and not particularly good talent show or perhaps a poor man's version of a judy garland/mickey rooney musical! i'd suggest the kids try to do something else to earn money...or perhaps sing and dance until people pay them to stop! i know i would pay them.considering that the talent is far from talented, peter is a bad actor and his change from lout to responsible adult is almost instantaneous, the whole thing is a bit hard to take. not a very good film by any sane standard, this is an obscure film that should have stayed obscure! by the way, it is interesting that ms. hayes' son in the film, peter, is actually her real life son. the only problem with that is that peter lind hayes is a truly awful actor. he's not handsome enough to be a leading man and he comes off as either dull and uninteresting or downright obnoxious. in particular, all the stupid impressions he does are really bad and he has the charisma of the gelatin that you scrape off spam. despite this terrible performance, he did go on to have a reasonably successful acting career. who would have believed it if you'd seen him in zis boom bah--because here, he's about as welcome as the bubonic plague!!

oh gawd. i want to time travel back to monogram studios and throttle someone in their 2 room front office for this sloppy musical. it is one watt above flat-lining for 60 of its 61 minutes and then actually shows (for the one thin minute, spread in milli-second blips across the hour) that there is real life talent being badly photographed.i just don't see the point of going to some trouble to actually make this film that could easily be energetic and actually funny and allow lethargy to be the main thing on view. the weird storyline shows cranky vaudeville trouper grace hayes bulldozing her blowsy way into a college where her rat-bag son is rich college clown. she's gonna fix his playboy ways, no matter what.her real life son (weird looking) peter hays plays her screen son. his real life wife plays her secretary. talk about nepotism. i suspect this talent package was almost the raison d'etre for monogram financing this back-lot musical produced by resident schlockmeister extraordinaire sam katzman. as with other monogram musicals it just looks more like a reason to film recent new furniture purchases and light fittings in order to show off to other studios that monogram pictures are 'lavish' in their b grade ways. have a ghastly look at swing parade of 1946 for genuine evidence of this: they just constructed this gigantic nightclub set then found an excuse to film actors and musicians running all over it. story? none. anyway zis boom bah is more bah than boom. where was gale storm and mantan mooreland when monogram really needed them? probably standing at the boom gate of prc pictures wondering if it looked safe to enter there. junior jive hepster roland dupree springs to life to rappety tap his teen legs around two wobbly dance numbers, especially in the 'big show' finale set in the new and expanded malt shoppe/club set. the usual crumpled curtains are loosely hanging on the back wall, and the stage set of mis matched drapery even has one dark main rag that is yanked back and forth as each amateur sequence elbows past the previous one. the chorus girls and their very plain looking partners in this finale just look like monogram office staff borrowed (from typing and carpentry) for the morning of filming. they have absolutely no dance talent and are so ordinary on screen... all the girls look like they are all called joyce. there is even a costume calamity where they wear frilly hot-pants...on one leg only. it is all so awful and crummy...and actually annoying when one more tweak up by all concerned would result in zis being actually fun. the one strangely interesting thing is the dialog delivery between grace and her son/daughter in law: it is so casually delivered that it actually works in spite of the script and logic. she has a very life like presence which is the only thing that allows the ridiculous story to be slightly compelling. the dupree kid is the real star. he can actually do something...in spite of looking like a tubby liberace tap dancing teen... you read that right.

having some idle time before going to work, i looked at my "50 movie pack comedy classics" dvd collection and picked the most obscure title in the pack: zis boom bah starring a forgotten grace hayes. "classics" is obviously the operative word here since most of the titles i've never heard of and i suspect they're all in the public domain. anyway, this movie also stars her son peter lind and his wife mary healy (who i just found out is a new orleans native from the state i live in, louisiana) with benny rubin as a malt shop proprietor and huntz hall, taking a break from the east side kids, as peter's buddy. the plot, about a vaudeville mother trying to turn her rich carefree son into a responsible one with him unaware of who she is, is for the birds and doesn't have many funny scenes though i did like peter's celebrity impersonations and his dance with hall in drag. and the songs and dances are entertaining in themselves. rubin, however, is all over the place with his confusion of the american vernacular of the time and almost everything concerning him makes no sense whatsoever (though i did like his funny dance). since this was only 61 minutes that i'm sure played on the lower-half of the double feature bill, i'll be charitable and give this one a 3 for the few entertaining bits that i mentioned enjoying.

the main portion of this lightweight musical story is located at fictional midwick college, which peter kendricks (peter lind hayes) attends due to the largesse of stage actress grace hayes, his real-life mother who fills the same role here, and who manages to supply his love interest through her secretary mary (healy) who is his real-life wife. drably directed from a weak script, and additionally hampered by excessive cutting and poor editing, this film does provide some treasures among its eight songs, including the title number, and has nice turns by soprano healy, benny rubin as a snack shop proprietor, and the dynamic tap dancing roland dupree.

this is absolutely awful. it's everywhere & nowhere & doesn't have any sort of point. i have never understood what is good about jeff garlin or sarah silverman. bonnie hunt is so above this drivel she must have been personal friends w/people involved because there is no way she would have read any part of this so-called "script" & thought, "yeah i wanna do that!" most movies i can find at least one or two things that are redeemable or funny. there is zero of that in this. it's extremely dumb. there really isn't any other word to describe this. this is quite possibly the biggest waste of money on making of film that i have seen in a long time. skip this at all cost, you'll be glad you did.

how i deserved to watch this crap??? worst ever. the acting was awful, when i read that this was a comedy i expected at least to smile, once - or twice, but.... if you are wiling to loose hour and a half of your lives, this is the right movie. i recommend just look in a wall or something, anything else but watch this "film". yoy can even watch a documentary (if you are a guy) about pregnant women, i guarantee it will be more entertaining :)the actor in this one (i forgot his name) is not that bad, and i am surprised how hi accepted the role. anyway "i want someone to eat cheese with" is the right film if you want to punish someone.

great ensemble cast but unfortunately a bunch of undeveloped ideas make the film drag. one feels not fulfilled at the end after waiting for some kind of conclusion, closure, or at least an ironic twist.it had that familiar "curb" feel without dare i say it, larry as the annoying polar opposite. the music was there, the 'show about nothing' scenes pop up, but without any common thread or suspense - it falters as a solo project that ran out of budget.spoilers: the movie title speaks about cheese but she prefers the rice pudding. is cheese a better selling title than rice pudding? he prefers just any junk food, regardless of the sell by date. maybe i want someone to eat 'cheese-dogs' or ice cream in a pirate suit would have at least tied some scenes together.marty: this is just not funny and overdone. people just don't care about a 'show' within a show. a coffee book table about coffee books was funnier.unless you are big fans of the cast, save your time and eat some cheese. it doesn't even have to be with anyone.

as a recent convert to curb your enthusiasm, which prompted my viewing of all season's episodes, i expected more, much more from jeff's efforts.when i view a film offering a slice of an average 'joe's' life i need reasons to be interested, to care, to feel and believe. and with jeff garlin at the helm i also expected a bevy of shining comedic moments. this film failed me time and again.jeff plays a living with mom, plump sad sack who is a social disaster. he has not had a relationships, real or even casual, for many years. he appears to be mostly unemployed and, as noted, shacks with his mommy dearest. can things get worse? sure. in short order he gets sacked by everyone around him including silverman, second city (his comedy workshop) and his agent. all reinforce his 'loser' status. silverman's 'fatty' experiment was as cruel as it was absurd. his obsession with the role of "marty," as the means of his career's salvation, also hits a big dead end.while the film's final moments offer a glimpse of better things to come the cinematic 'journey,' albeit with occasional golden glimmers, was sadly lacking.

when they announced this movie for tnt i was excited. a travesty from donald westlake's "enough" was one of my all time favorite stories. after i watched it i was not all that thrilled. recently i had the chance to watch it a second time with my aunt, and once again i was disappointed (she didn't like it much either, and she'd never read the book). in this movie they managed to sap all the charm from the book and turn it into dull mush. a big part of the problem was william h. macy. i like him fine in other films, but he played (terry/carey) thorpe as a stammering, incompetent yutz. in the book thorpe takes a lot of valium for his nerves, but remains outwardly collected at almost all times which is part of the fun. spoilers follow: they also left out a big part of the story (other than a 2 second glimpse at the embassy), where thorpe solves not 1 but 4 homicides for the police. this is important not just because it's funny, but because it helps set up the relationship between fred and thorpe. in the movie fred's betrayal in the end is not nearly as affecting, because they don't seem all that close. in the book they become pretty good friends especially on fred's side, which makes it all the more ironic that he is he one that arranges thorpe's downfall. fred also suffered a bit from casting, i love adam arkin but he was not a cheerful, happy to be alive upbeat sort of detective, character traits which book fred possesses which makes it more obviously out of character for him to mess with evidence and thus more shocking. patricia and edgarson were pretty close to the book, and james cromwell was great despite not looking much like martin balsam. the whole boring boat house scene which was entirely added for the film was much less interesting than the police finding edgarson's body after thorpe ships it to seattle and blaming the death on the mob. kit was okay although she was mostly rewritten, and it would have been nice to see her die as she did get slightly annoying. i don't mind changes to books to make movies, i know they are necessary because of length and difficulty, but it would have been nice if some of the changes in this movie had been funnier or smarter instead of duller.

this film is an undisguised attempt to appeal to a younger demographic of fourteen to 24 yr olds', and an insult to all of them. i refuse to believe that that age group is that vapid as to be entertained by this unnecessary "remake". early in the film one of the characters proclaims, "i am surrounded by idiots". this is the defining moment in the film, which goes steadily down from there. full of clichés, red-herring "scares" and unexplained events, the film is also full of characters who are not exactly brainiacs, a formula all too familiar in dumb horror movies. and that crappy "it's so dark i cant see" scenes stolen from chainsaw massacre but merely annoying, not building any tension, nor horror. it's difficult to film in the dark, and sometimes darkness is a great vehicle in a film that's suppose to have tension. but my own feeling was that the less you see in this case, the better. maybe he didn't want to wait until morning because he didn't care, other than it might cost him more money to do night scenes well, or he doesn't know how. who knows? unless you have never seen a horror film in your life, or you are two or three years old, every aspect of this film is predictable and done before. warning: paris hilton is in this movie. enough said. all in all a blasé slasher film which begs the question, where the h*ll is the wax?it was treated like a lost leader. if you're bored as possible and all other rentals are out or you're just in the mood for a bad horror film, which isn't really scary,or you'd like to see paris have a pole smash through her head, go ahead and take a chance. it's not the worst movie i've ever seen, but if this is what the producers of this film thinks a younger audience wants, i pray that they are deluded. a profit-driven film with no attempt to achieve any kind of art nor respect for the genre. you know, smart characters make for a scarier movie. i believe this is collet-serra's debut as a director, besides commercials and music videos. he has another one coming out in 2006 called goal 2. hopefully his goal is to make a better film.

ignore the extreme votes about "house of wax", in no way is it either a "1" or a "10". i will try to be of help to anyone thinking about seeing "house of wax" or for those who saw it based on the trailer and feel cheated. the trailer makes this movie look very promising, which is what trailers are supposed to do. there is only one thing for sure with trailers, if the producers can't cobble together a minute of interesting elements to make a trailer, it is a pretty much a sure thing that the movie is a major suck-fest. but a good trailer only tells you that a few things about the movie are good, it does not give you much idea about the total package. here a little research can be valuable. "house of wax" stars elisha cuthbert (whose acting skills are closer to kathy ireland than to either her fellow canadian sarah polley or her lookalike rose mcgowen), and was directed by a music video artist formerly known as jaume, in his feature debut. these are not good signs but if you are like me you ignore them and go to see the work of production designer grace walken, who was responsible for the look of "ghost ship". once again walken's work is worth seeing, so much so that it looks like 90% of the movie's $30 million budget went to production design. the rest went to cuthbert to compensate her for the abuse she has to take throughout the film (finger cut off, lips glued shut, tied up, and lots of wading around in assorted gooey stuff). by-the-bye, cuthbert looks considerably heavier than she did in "the girl next door", about one big pig-out away from having a major weight problem.which means they had little left over to pay the rest of the cast and crew. and judging from the what was on the screen, this might actually be true. it looks like everyone else donated their time to get their first acting or crew credit. unfortunately, whether it was inexperience or jealousy over the pay disparity, the contributions of all these inexperienced/incompetent volunteers amount to less than zero.inexperienced steven window's dp work was about as awful as you are likely to see and working in league with an incompetent editor like joel negran (insert "pearl harbor" here) they manage to take away most of the value added by the production design group. rather than linger over and showcase the sets, window filmed this stuff with bad lighting and jerky-zooming-bobbing camera work. negran compounded the problem with an insane number of disorienting cuts. poor lighting, an add-like camera, and flurry cutting are what you use to hide cheap and crappy production design; not what is needed when the movie's only strength is its expensive and detailed sets.chan hayes did the screenplay and charles belden (who wrote the original story) is credited as the writer although except for the title and the use of wax figures there is absolutely no similarity. one saving grace is that the movie does not take itself seriously as a horror film and is mostly parody (insert "van helsing" here). the murders are played for laughs, too extreme to be scary or even creepy to anyone over age six. the audience particularly cracked up when a certain high profile hotel heiress got her homely face run through by an steel bar, although her earlier half-baked striptease was the only genuinely creepy thing in the film. another comedy highlight was when cuthbert sticks her finger through a grate and has it clipped off by the bad guy.the good scenes take place in trudy's house of wax, a waxworks that has something to do with a closed sugar mill, conjoined twins, and a lot of roadkill (which cuthbert gets to bathe in). all this is supposed to be happening somewhere in rural florida although from the many hills it sure looks like paul hogan's country (attention location scouts-the gulf coast is not noted for it's rolling terrain). the screenplay apparently intended to play up the connection (bad pun) between the two sets of twins, but somewhere during production or post-production most of the dialogue concerning this was trimmed. since what is left about the twin connection makes no sense and goes nowhere, you wonder why it wasn't also cut to reduce the boredom factor.what is particularly sad is that the producers did not have the brains to recognize in mid-production that they had the ingredients for a first rate horror classic-even with the existing cast. what was staring them in the face was a chance to go somewhere with the illusion of a town of wax. because it is a photographic medium, modern film is intrinsically naturalistic, almost without exception prone to creating an illusion of reality. here they had a ready-made opportunity to give the photographic medium a theatrical element of extreme stylization. like an impressionist painting, the town creates the illusion of reality from a distance but reveals itself as a highly stylized wax fabrication up close. of course they would have had to find a visionary director and dp to bring the thing off successfully, but everything else was already in place for this to happen.

the third film based on charles belden's play entitled "mystery of the wax museum" (1933) targets generation x-tasy. twin screenwriters, chad hayes and carey w. hayes, spend more time developing the main characters than other slasher movies--a promising start. their condition guarantees an authentic point of view. the role of paige (paris hilton) was not much of a stretch for the world's favorite heiress. she peruses "in style," stripteases boys, chats on a cell, and frets over an ill-conceived pregnancy. her regular routine has been altered beyond repair. hilton reached the peak of her performance--not so hot--during the "1 night in paris" (2004) parody. while the pimp-my-ride is in motion, she zealously "looks for lip balm" in her boyfriend's (robert ri'chard) lap. finally, the "actress" atones for using the "n" word on the sex tape. director jaume collet-serra molds his take on the twin thing contrary to the theme of the past. each exhibited opposite characteristics back then, whereas a pair of either good or bad can come out the womb today. however, the latter does not rule out the former. childbirth constitutes the luck of the draw. spectators can hardly consider vincent (brian van holt) a contemporary quasimodo. granted, the recluses share some similarities such as artistry, disfigurement, submissiveness, and murder. yet, one small variable between the two makes all the difference. vincent is even uglier on the inside than he is on the out. collet-serra's "house of wax" pays homage to actor vincent price from the first remake in 1953. the film leaves obvious van gogh puns to the imagination of the audience. still, the choice to split the antagonist in two eliminates a vibrant twist at the end. professor henry (vincent price) jarrod's unmasking receives runner-up, but the most terrifying one in horror movie history belongs to lon chaney in "phantom of the opera" (1925). as far as the new contender is concerned, the aftermath of separation surgery downplays the effect. a surgeon should know operating on siamese twins scars them--physically and psychologically. their father needs to call a couple colleagues--dr. phil to consult and dr. mcnamara to nip/tuck. despite what the trailers said, "wax" is not forever. in fact, you can rid yourself of it by burning it.

a horrible, horrible, horrible film. i saw the original when i was a kid and it gave me nightmares into my teens. when i found out a remake was on the way, i groaned. why oh why remake a good film? well, we can thank dark castle for buggering yet another classic horror film. this time they've replaced a somewhat interesting story with gore, slower than slow pacing, and yawn-inspired characters. someone previously said that s/he was surprised that paris hilton can act. uh, were you watching the film? she plays a prissy little tramp. sounds like typecasting to me. half of the people in the audience actually cheered when she died! that tells you why people are seeing this film. if that's your only reason, then find a better one, because like a black hole this thing will suck out more of your life than you'll want. had i been alone, i would have left 10 minutes into the boring exposition. this thing is like a moron's guide to crap film-making: in bred southern git, stupid but attractive leads, knives a plenty, gore a plenty, stock menacing truck, i could go on. after watching this film, i began to really appreciate jeepers creepers, and i thought that film sucked. save yourself and avoid this crapfest at every cost.

is this a game fmv or a movie? in all honesty, i watched this one out of "choice-less-ness". it is a very big waste of time and money.it seems hk movies are heading in the opposite direction of the rest of the world.try to put more effort and money into a production and make us want to watch, rather than something you want us to watch.the graphics are so horrible than they looked like something out of the early to mid-90s low resolution games (in comparison to today's).the way they made this movie is almost exactly what they did in the 90s' wing commander game, namely the third installment of the series. stop regressing and make us asian look so bad at this compared to the big guns in hollywood.sure! they have big budgets and better actors. but we have some of the oldest histories, the myths and the legends, the best technophiles and possibly the largest computer graphic talent base in the world! so what went so very very wrong? did you start using the same old companies that have been working with you for so many films?! please stop wasting our time and money. this is the reason why hk movies are heading downhill so rapidly. didn't you claim to be the hollywood of the orient? guess not.

the movie was supposed to release in 2002 and was much awaited due to the promos but it finally released in 2003 after the producer diedthe movie is good in parts but overall isn't greatthe scenes between rani and ajay are okay but the other scenes are not well handledthe film is too similar to bollywood hollywood and though this was planned before that got released first so originality is lostmilan luthria disappoints overall after kachche daagemusic is good but too many songsajay devgan looks jaded and his appearance gives away that the film was delayed and his acting looks boring too rani is good sonali is good too rest are okay

my girlfriend wanted to see this (lol this is the case a lot)...so i rented it. then i saw how acclaimed this was nominated for 10 oscars. great! this should be good ol' drama. this movie had a lot of potential...the direction and the way everything was paced was very well. but once the movie ended, i couldn't help but ask myself if this story was really worth making a film for. virginia hill (annette bening) was extremely annoying, i just couldn't tolerate her character at all. warren beatty was excellent in the film acting-wise, but again i just found it hard to have sympathy for his character....he just came off essentially as a idiotic, hotheaded loser of a gangster..who had no place in 'the life' in the first place. how'd he get in with the likes of meyer lansky and lucky luciano anyway??? this film just left me with a bland but uneasy feeling...what was the big deal with this movie? i just didn't feel a completeness with bugsy. beatty's antics, although acted quite well, just seemed too random and illogical. i'm guessing that's how siegel really was....but it was just too much of that. there just didn't seem to be much of a real story here. my basic assessment of it would be "a hot-headed, playboy, underachieving gangster falls in love with a loser of a woman, comes up with the idea of 'las vegas'....but his failed attempt at the casino he builds, along with having no regard for his mob bosses' money gets him killed."what else is there besides that? i just didn't see the big deal with this, and it was a big disappointment. there must've not been many movies to come out in 1991, how this was nominated for 10 oscars is beyond me (although the two it won is justifiable). 1.5/4 stars.

bugsy siegel was 31 when he went out to the west coast. in addition to his dreams about las vegas, he toyed with the idea of acting. he was a good looking guy and about 7 years younger than his pal george raft, so it wasn't such a crazy idea.warren beatty was 54 when he made this movie and despite the hair dye, he's too old for this part. beatty was miscast; bugsy should have been played by someone like alec baldwin. bugsy was a tough guy feared by his contemporaries; beatty just doesn't radiate menace.this was a vanity project for beatty, who hasn't come to terms with the fact that he's no longer a leading man.the other big annoying miscast is mantegna as george raft. raft had a distinctive voice and mannerisms, none of which mantegna even attempts to match. you never once believe that mantegna came from the streets.warren beatty and robert redford have both been pretending to be younger for years by massive use of hair dye, and now it;ll be a shock to suddenly go gray and play character parts.

a tedious gangster film that leaves you wishing someone had edited it farce more ruthlessly. i would have thought that the story of the creation of las vegas would prove interesting but it fails at almost every turn. warren beatty's performance as the stupid and unlikeable bugsy seigel leaves you wishing you were watching someone else. once or twice he flashes through the fog of his performance to deliver an interesting scene but most of the time you just can't care about him. annette benning gives a skilled turn as his untrustworthy lover but even she's only faintly more savoury than he is.i really wouldn't bother with this turgid drama unless you're a benning devotee.

not as bad as "billy bathgate" but close. try as he might, warren beatty just could not be believed as bugsy. whenever he flipped out, instead of being shocked by the violence, i found it pretty embarrassing because it was so phony. the other actors don't fare as well either. annette bening just doesn't have what it takes to play seductive women, she is better off with safe characters. as many have noted, joe mantegna would have fared better if the script had him as a more believable george raft. only harvey keitel emerged unscathed, but then again this guy can do these movies in his sleep. and robert beltran, with just one line, steals one of the big beatty, bening scenes. with these films, i'm never sure if the director is intent on making the mobsters seem like normal businessmen or if it just comes out that way. either way, i don't like it. these guys were killers and no matter how much las vegas is indebted to bugsy siegel, i don't think that a movie should be made glorifying the guy, especially one with a big studio backing.

the only reason for me for watching this little known irish film was the question could mike myers have played a normal, dramatic character. well, he could and his acting was pretty good but unfortunately that was probably the only good thing that i can say about this film. in the beginning film follows life of twelve years old orphan mickey who lives with his brother and sister with their somewhat eccentric grandma. despite some strong language it looks like a family film but after a while it becomes clearly that pete's meteor is a hardly suitable for young audience drama. and the worst is that it is a drama with so much ridiculous and even totally implausible plot. one preposterous story line turns into another and all the time there is no much sense in the events on screen. i suppose when a life drama needs a meteor or what is more something that looks like even more ridiculous spiritual content that's a really bad sign. the characters are not much better than a story. despite all his troubles young mickey by no means is not a likable character but it's clearly was somehow we were supposed to care about him and even feel strong sympathy to him. it doesn't work. the same thing with other characters. they are mostly as ridiculous as the story itself with the title character (although he wasn't the main character) as the only bright spot. towards the end of the movie i still had a strong hope that there is something behind of all that improbability and absurdity. unfortunately even if the writer of the story had such intentions (and i'm sure he had) in the film they are hidden and practically imperceptible under such a weird script. grade: 3 out of 10. those of you who are interested in seeing mike myers as a drama actor can watch pete's meteor for that reason but the rest of viewers most likely will be bitterly disappointed.

too bad mike meyers picked this for his dramatic debut. this film looks like it was put together by a committee that couldn't decide if it was a comedy, drama, suspense, or sci-fi. it starts out sort of playful, then quickly gets darker, and then at the end, apparently shortly after one of the main characters has been killed, the whole family is standing in the backyard laughing about something. it's totally weird and impossible to string together. the acting is extremely uneven, with the older professionals engaging your attention, and then the younger and less experienced actors looking like they are in a high school play. this movie showed me that it's probably harder to make a good movie than is evident from the truly professional fare we see in the first-run and art houses. this would be a good film for a film class to analyze. plot, character, theme, consistency - they are all either faulty or missing from this film.

'take fame' and 'you've got served' and roughly jam them together and what do you got? this god awful movie custom made for dull-normal adolescents. the plot very closely follows 'you've got served.' three ghetto afro-teeners, this time living in john water's baltimorenot far from 'peckers' homespend their time getting failing grades in high school and dancing in dilapidated 100-year-old buildings with hoochy-mamas. to finance their expensive baggy hip-hop clothing tastes, they steal cars and deliver them to the local chop shopnot unlike john (tony manaro) travolta who worked in a brooklyn paint store so he could purchase his polyester disco clothes.tyler gage, one of the black three musketeers, gets caught trashing the local fame high school and is forced to perform janitorial duties. he meets nora clark, a 26-year-old white high school student and discovers he's irish-american, much to the chagrin of his black buddies mac and skinny.as in 'you've got served' crime doesn't pay and skinny, the youngest member of the trio gets shot by a bad bad leroy brown typebut that doesn't stop the musicand heart-stopping finale.

the actors cannot act. all dialoague was plagued with bad accents and loss of character. channing tatum never moves his lips or changes his facial expression... ever.the story is nothing new at all. some kid from the street gets involved in a professional world of dance and it turns his life around. that coupled with the whole incident involving the little kid is taken straight from you got served and save the last dance (i'm not saying that those movies were any good either, but that is to say that this movie brought nothing new to the table).and the dancing... there were only 3 dance sequences in the entire movie and 2 of them were taken straight from the commercial. perhaps i'm being overly critical because i am a dancer, but maybe thats what needs to be heard. channing tatum is not by any means a b-boy. his little solo in the parking lot had little style, technique, or any wow factor, all of which are part of a street dancer's criteria. all of the jazz and ballet in the movie had nothing to offer except bad technique and a few acceptable twirls, but nothing more. the grande finale left me thinking "... ok, now they're gonna get serious" all the way through the end when i realized it never was going to happen.i'll admit that im sure it is difficult to make a good dance movie, but step up is no exception to the rule. you got served, with the exception of its inconsistencies with street dance culture at least had the dance aspect. save the last dance was garbage, and so was just about any musical from the past 10 years (although i was impressed with moulin rouge)... look to center stage for ballet, look to beat street for hip-hop

i wasn't really interested in seeing step up, but my friend just kept bugging and bugging me to see this film, especially since she is so in love with channing tatum, i tease her constantly about it saying how that's the only reason why she loved the movie. but she somehow convinced me that it was a movie worth seeing, that if i loved movies like dirty dancing, take the lead, and save the last dance, that i should love step up, eh, what the heck? i guess every movie in some way has it's right to a view.well, you know those movies i just mentioned up top? dirty dancing, take the lead, and save the last dance? well, put them in a blender with some gangsta love in it and that's what you have. not to mention if you've seen those movies, well, frankly, you have seen step up. because channing is lower class with street smarts who just naturally feels the music while that snobby up class girl must follow step by step, how will they ever fall in love if they are so different? after all, this is their chance to "step up" to the passion, the mystery, and the lust of the dance! ok, that was a silly plot explanation, but like i said, as long as you've seen those movies i mentioned, or even if you just saw the plot, you get the movie. i don't understand how it actually has a 5.5 rating, i bet it's those channing lovers! lol! i'm kidding with you guys, but it's all good, i guess i just didn't get what others did with the passion, the mystery that is the dance! oh, antonio bandares, where are you when we need you?! 4/10

step up is a fair dance film about some kids that get their big performance break. the film is average in every way with little more for the viewer. a jock fights external prejudices to become a dancer with an accomplished partner and a teach who sees something special. the acting was fine, but the dialog and directing had little to add to overcoming a predictable story. none the less you still feel quite good about the outcome of the film. there were some dark scenes and some typical generalizations about dancers that went a little overboard. this is a class b+ film with moderate continuity errors and dialog mishaps. the scenery was good and the characters held true to life. it is worth the watch if you like that kind of film.

going into the movie with the right expectations, i somewhat liked this movie. like most reviewers who have seen this movie, i fully agree that the plot was razor thin, clichéd, and i could predict every plot twist from the very beginning of the movie. but, the dancing sequences were very well done, and i really enjoyed the fusion of classical and hip-hop dance (both which i enjoy watching). the music/soundtrack of the movie was also very good, which made the "drama" scenes more bearable. the leads (jenna dewan and channing tatum) were ok as actors, but their dancing throughout the movie was impressive and mesmerizing.all in all, a movie worth watching if you like to watch good dance sequences, and this movie is much much much better than "you got served" in terms of the plot and drama. then again, that doesn't say much, does it? =p

teenage exorcist is one of those god-awful films to video that makes the viewer give up any expectations of decent entertainment for low brow sexual antics, adolescent humour, and empty writing. this film delivers exactly what its was trying to deliver. it is about a girl moving into a house where a baron de sade(hmmm) once lived and finally being drawn to him through her own inner demon. her sister and brother-in-law, along with an irish priest, her boyfriend, and a pizza delivery boy, try to save her and exorcise her demon. well, not much here in way of horror or suspense. in fact, one line from the film pretty much sums up what to expect. mike(the girl's brother-in-law) has tied her(the name is diane by the way and she is played by brinke stevens) up after trying to chainsaw her sister. he removes a gag from her mouth and says something like, "this won't be the last gag we see tonight." indeed, it was not. the special effects are cheesy and poorly crafted, and the film makes use of this by playing on its comedic appeal. some of the lines and situations are funny. robert quarry, old count yorga himself, really steals his scenes as an irish priest. he hams it up wailing biblical verses and crooning irish songs. you know you are in trouble, however, when eddie deezen gets top billing. deezen does his schtick and has a couple nice moments as well, but the material is just too threadbare than to be anything more than teenage sophomoric time filler. michael berryman, from the hills have eyes, also has a brief but interesting cameo in the film. as for the other thespians, well, they are all pretty good at being pretty mediocre. stevens is lovely in fishnet stockings and french-cut panties, but beyond that don't expect too much more from her. her sister is played by elena sahagun, and she shows a bit more than brinke(a very lovely young lady by the way) and out acts brinke by miles. her husband, played by jay richardson shows off his ability to act and be funny amidst mediocrity. again, not a bad film to waste a little time that involves no thinking on. if you are a robert quarry fan, watch it for his performance at the very least.

as i watched this movie, i felt as if a plastic bag was slowly closing in around my head. the acting was horribly stifling, and it was bad acting. the most brilliant piece of acting in the entire film was the guy who had to play laid-out-in-state-in-a-coffin. i felt nothing but relief when it was finally over. i was expecting that this film was going to be some real tragedy, with some deep psychological intrigue in the aftermath. all around it was stupid, no beginning, no climax, no ending, just rambling on and on, and the plastic bag kept getting worse. let's get real here. this is an awful movie.

this movie was horrible and corny. james agee is rolling in his grave.this movie was nothing at all like the book and made a mockery of it. no one should see this movie unless they want to gag.

writer-director patrice leconte takes a universal and potentially bottomless subject - friendship - and turns it into a flat and meaningless farce, despite a-list actors, fine cinematography and elegant production design. it's all in the plot, and the plot is laughable. "teach me how to be likable", art dealer françois coste (daniel auteuil) tells a random stranger (dany boon), and that about sums it up. we learn next to nothing about friendship, and daniel auteuil may be a fine actor, but not one minute do we believe he could be the cut-throat egoist the script depends on him to be. just as we hope the travesty is over, leconte pulls one of his usual cathartic third acts, fast-forwarding from damage to disaster. like françois's treasured greek vase, everyone and everything in this movie is a fake. leconte's only asset is julie gayet in the part of coste's business partner catherine, looking swell and sexy despite a major mishap of a haircut.

don't be taken in because the premise of this film is a good one. it is, but that, does not a good film, make.comedies require a well-honed script and masterful direction. sadly, this poorly executed film has neither. leconte, a good director in other genres, does not deliver in his comedic farces (les bronzes series being another example).the comedic timing is terrible. some jokes are telegraphed. some are re-hashed from other movies. others just sit there as if they were giving you time to laugh. the plot has messy subplots (the allergic daughter, the lesbian co-owner) and just does not develop or envelope the viewer. it isn't funny and it isn't believable for a second.compare this to any comedy by billy wilder (some like it hot, a foreign afair, etc.) or by leconte's compatriot, francis veber, a true genius at french comedy (le diner de cons, le placard, les comperes, la chevre, la grande blonde, etc.) and you'll see the difference in their tight scripts, great comedic acting and timing, with each joke leading to the next one.watching mon meilleur ami twice would be cruel and unusual punishment, not a good sign for a comedy.

i have always wanted to see the movie because i loved the novel, but was warned away because i'd heard that the movie was a stinker. it is. fowles wrote the script and i could follow it fine, despite the fact that i read the novel over thirty years ago.the soundtrack is execrable--jarring, jangling, and utterly inappropriate--breaking any attempt at mystery or mood in the movie. i suspect that the director must take a lot of the blame as even michael caine is terrible in it and he was already doing excellent work in alfie a couple of years earlier.the "mysteries" evoked by the book are not well-translated onto the screen. i'd love to see someone remake this one.

i loved the gorgeous greek scenery but the story, which is not something you can follow anyway, was even harder to follow in the movie. i cannot imagine how anyone watching the movie can get any kind of grip on it if they have not read the book, and then, like me, they would probably wonder why australian allison turned into french anne, and many other seemingly pointless changes in the story. the mysteries in the book seemed to be chopped up or left out in the movie. i saw it when it first came out and had the same problems with it then, since i had read the book several times. i recently watched it with my granddaughter (very intelligent at 20 and usually into movies i like) who was mostly amazed at how young michael caine and candace bergen were in it, but otherwise could not imagine why one would watch it except for the scenery.

since the magus is a confusing puzzle that really has no solution, one should sit back and enjoy the scenery. set on a "remote greek island," it stars a very uptight michael caine as a teacher working at a school for boys who gets caught up in mind games with local wacko/mystery man anthony quinn and his daffy girlfriend candice bergen. quinn, looking like pablo picasso with white hair and striped sailor shirt, is actually pretty good but caine looks like he's ready to explode. bergen, although stunning, should not put on a british accent ever. she's not very good at that type of thing. guy green's direction is fine, but unless you have infinite patience with the circular logic of the film, you will not enjoy it. a real sour note is the casting of the effervescent anna karina in the completely joyless role of caine's girlfriend. after seeing her in the likes of a woman is a woman and a band apart, her presence here is quite jarring.

what an utter disappointment. forget this abysmal film and get hold of the tv series instead. what on earth were they doing making the american president relatively sane? all the politicians should have been bumbling buffoons (peter cook is good as the british pm). it lacks the biting satire of the original, going instead for "lowest common denominator" slapstick. 1 out of 10 if i'm being generous! this is unfortunately yet another example of a remake which totally misses the point of the original, the difference with this one being that they were both written by the same people.

i don't care what anyone says, this movie is hilarious! it combines the bleak seriousness of threads with an anarchic blend of alternative comedy, and the results are a severely dark, but outrageously funny satire on the brinkmanship policies of both the western and eastern blocs at the time. you gotta give the filmmakers credit for even attempting to top the real life lunacy of "duck and cover" or "protect and survive"!imagine someone made a movie based on the dead kennedys track 'kinky sex makes the world go round', and you're pretty close to whoops! apocalypse. add rik mayall on top form as an insanely ott sas commander and you've got it exactly. a worthy companion piece to dr strangelove, and that's saying something.

this film wasn't good at all. i was able to catch it at a film festival and didn't appreciate the content i was forced to watch. it's a well shot film about family looking to reconnect after the death of the family's cornerstone (gabrielle union) dies. the film stars billy dee williams as gabrielle's union's brother. well, actually, gabrielle union portrayed the woman in her early years, which should help explain why the woman was billy dee williams older sister. this had to be billy dee william's worst performance in his career, ever. he looked as if he didn't remember his lines in a few scenes. he was an unlikable, hardly ever empathetic character, who fathered a daughter while married to a white woman whom he already had a daughter with as well. the two daughters are older now and while the daughter he had with the white woman (lucy) was trying to connect with him, his other daughter didn't want anything to do with him. billy dee's character was so pathetic that the only way they can get him to fly in from paris for his sister's funeral was by telling him that the funeral had already passed and his late sister left him with the responsibility of handling her paperwork. why they had to fool him? because he didn't like attending funerals. i know. you're asking, "but he didn't want to attend his own sister's funeral too?" yes! he claims he didn't like being around the forced feelings of emotions that is shared amongst the people paying their respects. he didn't want anything to do with that. now we're suppose to empathize with that a**hole? the rest of the performances in the film were flat with equally flat characters. the director and editor didn't care to consider the pacing of the film. the flashbacks were painful to watch. it was a bad film. however, it seems to be the favorite at black film festivals; a film that glorifies african-americans dependence on caucasians to find a love that they can settle down with, even if it is a healthy relationship. when lame love stories like this win best of festivals at the black film festivals, it makes me question the judgment of black people on film. in these same festivals, the only films that win awards are educational films about african american culture and black films directed by caucasian directors. i'm not saying that anything is wrong with a white person directing stories written for people of color. the problems with these films is that they never argue from both point of views, which are usually the films that actually speaks to the masses. these films are often one-sided forms of didacticism. these films fail at executing the powers of both sides of the argument that the film is revolved around. the writers and directors never compose the scenes and sequences that contradict your final statement with as much truth and energy as those that reinforce it. these films always slant the argument. what i am saying is, are the people running these black film festivals judging a film off of pure content, which to me means directing, acting, writing cinematography, editing, etc., or are they judging films off of strictly the message being delivered about african american culture? are we suppose to expect a film like constellation to have a shot in the world against films like "million dollar baby" and "sideways?" what happened to film being entertaining? when i mean entertainment, i mean the ritual of sitting in the dark, staring at the screen, investing tremendous concentration and energy into what one hopes will be satisfying, meaningful emotional experience. why can't these festivals appreciate films that get their messages across without preaching? why can't these black film festivals acknowledge films that are well told pieces of work that are brutally honest, telling the truth? "i believe we have no responsibility to cure social ills or renew faith in humanity, to uplift the spirits of society or even express our inner being. we have only one responsibility: to tell the truth."--robert mckee. now that's something i totally agree with. these same black film festivals put down "hustle and flo" as if it is that awful film stereotyping blacks. however, it's an honest film about a pimp with a dream. a pimp can't dream? i recall the last time i saw a real pimp he was a human being. and aren't they, pimps and prostitution a harsh reality in our society at large, not just in the black community but all over? the powers that be in "black hollywood" believe that films like this are making afro-americans look bad in the eyes of others, as if others don't know that there are pimps in the hood. the truth is, until african american people in film can accept the truth about themselves and dare to share it with the world, then our films will never have a chance in the world. this film was awful. the best thing was the cinematography and zoe.

a tedious yawn of a film that retains nothing of the zing and raciness of its predecessor, "gold diggers of 1933." the production code was firmly in place by the time of this film's release, so the humour is all of the hokey, wocka-wocka variety and gone are the dry one-liners that sounded so cosmopolitan dripping off the lips of the gorgeous dames from the first film. a cast of second-tier stars and character actors go through the motions here, and the "puttin' on a show" motif seems awfully forced; instead of the make or break world of broadway, the show here is a charity event hosted by a swanky hotel. who really cares whether or not the show goes on? the score here is bland too. of course the movie's big number is "lullaby of broadway," which accompanies a long fantasy dance number about a new york socialite's eventual demise from too much partying--doesn't exactly have the same effect as the searing "forgotten man" number used as the finale in '33. busby berkeley directs as well as choreographs this film, and whatever promise is built up in the film's fluid opening scenes quickly deteriorates. unfortunately, no one learned any lessons from this, and there was yet another gold diggers movie two years later.grade: c-

after his widower father dies in a horsing accident, young tom burlinson (as jim craig) is left to manage his australian "snowy river" farm, with only wizened, peg-legged prospector kirk douglas (as spur) to help. times are hard, so mr. burlinson goes to work for mr. douglas' wealthy, silver-haired brother rancher "mr. harrison" (also played by kirk douglas). when a big job comes up, the silver-haired (older?) douglas feels burlinson is too young and inexperienced to go along; so, burlinson stays behind, and falls in love with the boss' daughter, sigrid thornton (as jessica harrison).the least satisfactory aspect of director george miller's "the man from snowy river" is a weak storyline. observe, for example, the "jessica is lost" sequence of events. the damsel gets lost in one of those "freak" storms, while running away. her worried father rounds up a posses of drunk men to find her, after predicting bad weather. damsel "jessica" rolls herself on to the edge of a conveniently appearing cliff. father and the suddenly sober men don't check burlinson's farm. hero burlinson discovers the damsel. after building a fire, he decides to kiss her.the "romance" is played too innocently for as obvious an attracted man and woman as burlinson and ms. thornton. to make matters worse, the douglas brothers have a "dark history" which is revealed before any mystery is built up regarding the matter. the main attraction, herein, is the australian scenery.**** the man from snowy river (1982) george miller ~ tom burlinson, kirk douglas, sigrid thornton

dreadful! a friend of mine (who obviously thought i had an abysmal sense of humour) recommended this.it's bobbins. i almost switched it off. it is only my anal desire to not leave things unfinished that prevented me doing so.this was evidently a british attempt to make a movie with a bunch of also ran tv actors using some lame script from their mate in the business. i struggle to think of anything even approaching the paucity of this movie. less funny than global warming.i'm not normally so vehement, but i watched this well over ten years ago and thought that i wasted an hour or so of my life on it is destructive.puerile, plot less, useless tosh.i'd rather eat my feet than watch it again.

...and i bought a vampire motorcycle staggers all over that line like a drunk with his shoelaces tied together. some 'bad' films are quite enjoyable (like norman j.warren's inseminoid), some 'bad' films are just bad (like kent bateman's headless eyes), but 'bad' films that try and do the post-modernist thing of being knowingly bad should always be approached with extreme caution. a lot of people think troma's terror firmer is a bad-taste masterpiece, for example, but i'm guessing anyone over the age of nineteen will shrug it off as worthless dreck. then there's john carpenter's dark star. yes, it's quaint, and certainly a product of its time, but as a film it's only two notches above worthless. this no-budget british black comedy-horror outing tries to achieve a satirical tone, with its endless references to its fellow shoestring splatter flicks (among them psychomania, horror hospital and pretty much anything by pete walker), but due to dismal performances by second-string tv actors (the leading lady looks like amy winehouse), a script that appears to have been written on the back of a peeled beermat by two 'lads' with no understanding of how film comedy works, dean friedman's (intentionally?) dire elevator-rock soundtrack and production values never rising above mediocre, the net result is a film that can only be laughed at, rather than with. if your idea of whoopee is anthropomorphic turds, chinese takeaways called fu king and references to long-forgotten tv ads, you'll enjoy this one, but don't expect too much.

the plot here is simple. country boy, lem (farrell) goes to the city to sell the wheat crop, falls in love with a waitress, kate (duncan) and marries her, bringing her home to a hostile father and a group of woman-hungry reapers. there are shades of they knew what they wanted and mice and men here. the courtship, taking place in two lengthy sequences set in the restaurant, consume the first half hour and are lethargically paced. lem is so weak he allows his father to mistreat his wife, who is propositioned by mac (richard alexander) , one of the reapers, to come away with him. duncan and alexander are the only good things in this tedious potboiler, which lacks the insights and the cinematic beauty we expect from murnau. farrell's character has no backbone so we wind up rooting for a "real man" (mac) to take kate away from it all. with audience sympathy skewed, the film loses its narrative progression. the father's conversion at film's end is unrealistic and unbelievable, making for a contrived denouement. this film is for fans of the stars and the director only - general audiences need not bother.

***big spoilers!*** "flesh feast" of 1970 is a more than unworthy conclusion to the great veronica lake's career. this has the wide reputation of being an awful stinker, and rightly so, i must say. as a huge fan of low-budget horror/exploitation, especially from the 70s, i nonetheless chose to watch this, mainly due to the cool camp-looking picture on this site, but after watching it i had to recognize that the picture actually has nothing to do with the film. the picture here on this site is the cover of a dvd collection entitled 'flesh feast' containing four films, including sergio martino's "mountain of the cannibal god" and dal tenney's "i eat your skin". what the collection does not include, however, is this boring turkey. "flesh feast" is not only camp and ridiculous, but mostly quite tedious, which is even more pathetic regarding that the film is only 70 minutes long. also, don't get fooled by the title, the film is not gory at all. yet it is watchable, if only for its trashiness and, especially, the extremely stupid, but therefore somewhat entertaining ending. the film follows a ridiculous plot about dr. elaine frederick (veronica lake), an ingenious female scientist who can somehow rebuild youth with the help of flesh-eating maggots (don't ask how). a bunch of criminals (or terrorists, or whatever), who are paid by a radical political group assign the doctor to restore the youth of a 'mysterious' commander. after an endless hour of nonsensical drivel, it turns out that the mysterious commander is actually hitler himself. it was quite obvious before, but i still had to burst out laughing because the film's finale was so unbelievably silly and unintentionally hilarious... this is a film that is very inadequate as the last film of a great actress and former beauty queen like veronika lake. except for lake, the performances are ridiculously bad, even for a zero-budget production like this. bad performances, however, are something i can easily forgive in films like this one. what i can not forgive, though, is extreme boredom. the final five minutes make this watchable for hardcore fans of camp stuff, but i would still recommend to skip it.

flesh feast starts at miami airport, ace reporter dan carter (harry kerwin, he is also credited as production designer) phones his mate ed casey (phil philbin) to let him know that he has just returned from south america where he has been investigating carl schuman (doug foster) & that he was onto a big story but while still talking on the phone he is stabbed in the back & killed. schuman meets dr. elaine frederick (veronica lake, she also executive produced) who has recently been released from a mental institution, together they discuss their grisly plans. the news of cater's death has reached casey & he decides to take the story up himself & do some investigating, well actually he gets his secretary viginia day (marth mischon) to do most of the investigating & just report back to him, lazy bugger. virginia informs casey that they have someone on the inside named kristine (heather hughes) since dr. frederick rents her spare rooms out to nurses, kristine reports back to casey about schuman & dr. frederick's grotesque youth restoration experiments involving human flesh & specially cultivated maggots...co written, co-produced & directed by brad f. grinter flesh feast is a pretty poor film on all accounts. first lets start with the script by grinter & thomas casey who was also responsible for the cinematography (you get the feeling that most of the cast & crew had more than one job), basically it's terrible. the character's are one dimensional idiots & have no personality, i didn't like anyone in this film. for what it's worth i quite like some of the ideas here, the flesh-eating maggots, the basement laboratory, stealing bodies from a hospital & that unforgettable 'twist' ending that's almost worth sitting through the rest of the film for on it's own. unfortunately the dialogue is so badly written, stiff & unnatural sounding it's untrue, i mean there is one scene in which a nurse says that they "won't let us out of the house" which is fine except for the fact that she is speaking outside in the garden to someone. no thought has been put into the story as no explanation is ever given for why flesh-eating maggots are able to restore youth, in fact at one point near the end when questioned about this very thing dr. frederick claims there is no time to explain at that point which to me sounds like the people who wrote this didn't have a clue either! even at an extremely short 68 minutes long flesh feast is very slow & dull, the poor editing doesn't help with scenes & shots lasting for far too long, for example there is a scene in which an ambulance pulls up outside a hospital, drives up to the doors, the guy gets out, he walks to the back doors & opens them etc. etc. did we really need to see every single detail? there is also another sequence in which dr. frederick enters room & puts some gloves on, then she takes them off walks into the opposite room & puts another pair on! i personally think that grinter probably didn't shoot enough material so he stretches every scene out as much as he can to make the run time up. i do like that bizarre ending though, i really do. technically flesh feast is complete crap, i'm not sure what the budget was on this but it must have been small, very small. just about the entire film takes place in one house, dr. frederick's laboratory consists of a table, some plastic beakers & test tubes, some ancient looking electronic medical equipment & a strange screen with funny colours on it (don't ask). the cinematography is poor, the music sucks & the entire film looks dubbed, badly dubbed too. the exploitation elements are also disappointing, there are a few maggot shots but they don't actually do anything other than wriggle a bit, there is a brief scene where a dead body has it's leg sawn off & a ok looking dismembered corpse & limbs hanging on hooks. the acting is awful from everyone concerned, & i mean really bad which makes the rubbishy dialogue even worse. do yourself a favour & avoid flesh feast, yes there are one or two unintentionally funny moments & that ending is, well unique to say the least but for the most part this is real amateur film-making that quickly becomes painful to watch. i doubt most people will make it through this is one sitting, i can tolerate just about anything but even i considered switching it off. definitely one to avoid, you'll be pleased you did & if you really have to see it don't say you weren't warned!

once upon a time, way back in the 1940's, there lived an actress named veronica lake. a beautiful, talented young woman who was once in high demand for many big-budget, hollywood pictures. fast forward to the late 1960's, age, alcoholism, and all-around bad luck has tarnished everyones favorite actress. now a hasbeen, miss lake decides the time has come to follow in the foot steps of her peers(?), joan crawford, and bette davis, and fall back on good ol' reliable horror. but flesh feast? really? she couldn't have possibly been that washed up. to put it delicately, flesh feast is a lifeless pile garbage, possibly one of the top 5 worst films i've ever seen, and i've seen them all. lake plays a scientist, who is plotting, with nazi's, to bring hitler back to life, with youth restoration experiments involving maggots, that's right, maggots. unless you're a huge fan of heather hughes, run away and never look back!! i know very little about this veronica lake person, as well as 40's flicks, but to think that such a successful career actually became that dismal, is actually pretty sad. flesh feast is almost impossible to get through, and by almost, i mean absolutely. directed by brad grinter, director of nudist camp pictures, and the man who, coincidentally brought us the greatest b-movie ever made, blood freak, just a couple years later. one has to wonder, is this what blood freak would have been like if grinter hadn't co-directed with steve hawkes? if so, then god bless steve hawkes. you wouldn't think that a religious, dope-blood craving, turkey monster could be that much better than experiments involving maggots and hitler, but it really, really is. so forget you ever heard of this one and go find blood freak, it's just waiting to entertain you. fast forward a couple years later, veronica lake dies of hepititas, broke, and forgotten. the end. i hate you, flesh feast. 1/10

in the 1940s, veronica lake made a meteoric rise to film stardom, thanks to her sultry beauty and, her highly exploited "peekaboo" hairstyle. she starred opposite big names like alan ladd and fredric march, scoring screen successes in films like "this gun for hire" and "i married a witch". she held her own with female stars as well, and she surprised even her detractors with her performance as a bitter navy nurse in "so proudly we hail". but changing times and her own failings caught up with her, and by the end of the decade, her heyday was over. with two unsuccessful marriages behind her (and two more in her future) veronica headed for new york city, where she made occasional television and summer stock appearances before dropping completely out of sight. it was briefly big news when she was found working as a barmaid in a second rate hotel in the early sixties. but by now, her longtime alcoholism and years of hard living had robbed her of her looks. without them, public interest in her soon faded again. she did return to the stage in assorted vehicles, but her success was minimal. eventually, she relocated to miami, florida, where she lived in relative obscurity. in 1966 she went to canada for a part in an obscure movie called "footsteps in the snow" which had no u.s. release. the following year, she was discovered by some industrial filmmakers who had long wanted to produce a commercial feature. they approached her to star in their film "time is terror" and convinced her to invest in the project. as one author put it, "if ever a movie queen suffered a terminal comedown, this was it". surrounded by amateur performers and pathetic production values, she failed even to rise to a minimal level in this miami, florida shot quickie. looking utterly ordinary in long shots, and luridly aged in close-ups, poor veronica didn't act so much as walk through her part. as a deranged doctor, who has hit upon a successful youth restoration formula, using flesh-eating maggots!, she looks both bored and confused, her most unintentionally hilarious moment coming when she is forced to ad-lib while she struggles gamefully to don a pair of rubber gloves. the supporting cast is no help at all, merely advancing the plot by talking it to death. director brad grinter apparently only required the actors to move while the camera was pointed at them, no need for anything resembling entertainment (there is, admittedly, one unintentionally hilarious scene involving a private detective/nurse and a corpse in a wheelchair that predates ''weekend at bernie's'' by almost 20 years.) according to veronica herself, the film was shelved for three years because no master shots were filmed. but in 1970, the production company scraped it together, changed the title to "flesh feast", and released it to cash in on lake's just published biography. and, because former leading ladies such as bette davis, joan crawford and olivia de havilland had unexpectedly revived their careers in horror movies, this travesty was promoted as veronica's "comeback film". this seems a strange course of action for the filmmakers to pursue, though, because it's unlikely that the (young) audience for a horror film of this quality either knew or cared who veronica lake was. as expected, it did nothing for veronica's career, and she died in poverty, three years later. a previous reviewer cites a scene in which the female detective working undercover as a nurse in the doctor's laboratory (overseeing the theft of bodies from a nearby morgue) enlists the help of a multi-talented chauffeur to cut up the body parts. "poor mrs. lustig," she sighs, "i hope she doesn't mind leaving her body to science." "try not to think about it," advises the chauffeur, sawing away. "i guess you are right, hans." concludes the detective/nurse, "what is done is done." what a sad end to the career of a still fondly remembered star.

since i was just finishing the book, `mrs. dalloway' by virginia woolf, i was excited to see that it was on one of the movie channels last weekend. what i encountered, however, is a film that was boring, incomprehensible and non-sensical. one cannot entirely blame the film, it tried the best it could with the material it had, but when the source material is virginia woolf, and is almost entirely written in stream-of-conscience style with extended periods of internalizing and little actual dialogue, one would certainly think that there shouldn't be a film made from it just because a film can be made from it. vanessa redgrave, who plays the title character, does not deserve any blame for the failure of this film, nor do any of the other actors. it is just simply a film that could not intelligibly be made from the story that woolfe wrote, and should not have even been attempted. don't watch the movie, read the book. --shelly

i kept waiting for the film to move me, inspire me, shock me, sadden me in some way but it stirred none of my emotions. it just meandered along to the end. none of the characters seemed very unique or complex, they just seemed like actors reciting their lines. i think it could have been a better movie if the characters expressed more emotion. the only one who did and was believable was the veteran and he probably committed suicide just to get out of the movie as soon as he could. it was a waste of talent, film, their time, and mine. if there is a message or meaning or genius in this story, it certainly is well-hidden or i am very dense, which i doubt.

i couldn't believe this was the same director as antonia's line.this film has it all, a boring plot, disjointed flashbacks, a subplot that has nothing to do with the main plot what so ever, and totally uninteresting characters. it was painful to watch. soooo, painful.

"stick around" is one of the brief series of films that paired bobby ray with oliver 'babe' hardy before hardy's immortal teaming with stan laurel. several critics have suggested that ray and hardy -- the gormless little man and the overbearing big man -- were a prototype for laurel and hardy, but that simply isn't true. ray and hardy play off each other well, but really aren't a team; in each of these films, ray has more footage and is clearly meant to be the hero, while hardy bullies him in a manner very much unlike his later "ollie" character's treatment of "stanley". it's very clear that the relationship between little bobby and big babe was inspired by earlier chaplin films, in which the little tramp was bullied by huge mack swain or burly eric campbell.however, in "stick around", hardy sports a bowler hat that's identical to his later "ollie" titfer (although with a fuller moustache), and he and bobby -- after spending most of this movie as adversaries -- end up as drunken comrades.bobby is a paperhanger for the firm of matz and blatz, with hardy as his boss. when the tardy bobby tries to pretend he showed up promptly, there's some clever physical business between the two men that reminds me of a routine performed by roscoe arbuckle and buster keaton in 'the garage'. a bit later, bobby ray -- whose brief acting career never firmly developed a screen persona -- performs an "impossible" gag that would have been inappropriate for stan laurel, when he pulls a long stepladder out of a much smaller toolkit.the paperhangers go to work in a sanitarium, and there are the usual unrealistic depictions of mental illness: one resident insists on sitting on a piece of toast because he thinks he's a poached egg! there are also some howlingly racist (and tastelessly unfunny) gags involving a black man who obligingly lets the inmates crack open walnuts on top of his head. when he sees a *picture* of a lion -- not even a photograph, mind you -- he goes all cowardly as if it were an actual wild animal."stick around" is fairly dire. most of the pantomime and acting is much broader than it needs to be for a slapstick comedy; even hardy, already a very subtle actor by 1925, pongs badly with his over-acting here. there are several bad examples of shot-matching. i was impressed with one unusual camera set-up, when a fat pedestrian's face is dirtied and we see a close-up of his reflection in a hand mirror, rather than his actual face.spoilers coming. during their brief pairing, hardy typically played ray's boss or adversary or both; here, for once, they end up as pals. it's a nice ending, but it doesn't make up for what's really a poor film. my rating for this one is only 4 out of 10.

this film is terrible. not only is the story unbelievable, the situations the characters put themselves in are so silly, to the point where it isn't shocking. i find it sad that daisy eagan, star of broadway's the secret garden, decided that this would be a career step. the idea is interesting, two young girls coming of age very quickly. but the sex isn't even arousing. the film is silly, the story is silly, the performances are silly, and the whole concept while interesting falls flat. i'm sure all 14 year old girls make out with guys after they've had their first period and tried to flush their panties down the toilet. better luck next time guys. my scale * t-scale *

if this movie had been directed by a man, he would have been jailed. while adrian lyne was shackled with a lawyer in the editing room to oversee the gutting of a classic piece of literature to appease the censors, and to avoid running afoul of the child pornography protection act of 1996, a woman dumps ripe on us and everyone applauds. did i miss a meeting? in addition to the blatant pedophilia, this movie is utterly preposterous. has this woman never set foot on an active military base? has she never met a soldier? whose army is this? the uniforms must have come from uniforms-r-us. just throw on some patches, who cares? just make sure each and every one of them has a big red one. there is a slight inside joke here that no doubt went over the auteur's head, but might possibly have been slipped in by whoever furnished the military vehicles. certainly there were no military advisors. the u.s. army does not operate slums. temporary base camps in jungle war zones are cleaner than this. the u.s. army does not put 14-year-old girls to work on military bases, nor allow them to use the firing ranges or training courses. there is much drama to be mined in the sexual coming-of-age of teenage girls. this movie has absolutely nothing to do with that whatsoever.

uninspired, pretty much all around. the only exceptions were a couple emotional scenes with keena (violet), with whose performance i was pleasantly surprised and occasionally moved. beyond that, it ended up being little more than a bad coa flick.

"ripe" is one of those awful indies which manages to get into circulation and give indies a bad name. telling a stupidly incongruous tale of pubescent twin sisters who crawl from a firey car crash which kills their parents and then hit the road while happily shoplifting, making goo-goo eyes at some guy, and ending up on an army post so dilapidated no army would want it (yeah, right!). an apparent attempt at a coming of age flick, "ripe" is an almost complete loser which wanders aimlessly as the players drift in and out of character finally ending clumsily with nary a shred of credibility to be found anywhere. not recommended for anyone.

this movie was, in one word, terrible. it was boring, predictable, and downright creepy. i kept waiting for it to end and when it did, i was horrified. the ending left a bad taste in my mouth, to say the least. my advice to anyone interested in movies about budding female sexuality: stay away from this movie. movies like this give classics like lolita a bad name.

this movie did attempt to capture the naive idealism that many young teenaged girls have for fun, friendship, escape, danger, sex, maturity, etc. the problem was that it failed to establish these things on every single level; which is why it failed to build a decent story around them. i couldn't follow the point of any part of this story, nor any reason why i should care.this movie is not an exploration into pedophilia at all. it's basically about a girl being in love with her sister, and her sister being in love with the idea of "men". while the latter tries out her love of men, the former tries to win her sister back by "getting even".the plot is weak, the characters are weak, and the reality of it all was similar to an amateur porn filmmaker (without the sexual substance).

thinly-cloaked retelling of the garden-of-eden story -- nothing new, nothing shocking, although i feel that that is what the filmmakers were going for. the idea is trite. strong performance from daisy eagan, that's about it. i believed she was 13, and i was interested in her character. the rest left me cold.

there are so many things wrong with this movie i don't even know where to begin. the story is not cohesive at all. i guarantee that five minutes into the movie the average viewer will be scratching his/her head in confusion.here's what i remember of the movie before i was bored into unconsciousness: a quasi-abusive dad chases some pre-teen sisters through a house but turns out to be not that abusive after all. in the next scene, the girls are about 15. they're driving with their parents and hit a deer. the deer must have been explosive because their car blows up, one sister drags the other from the burning wreckage. then, the girls are drifting in a boat on a lake and make a huge plan to go to kentucky (??) and start a new life. in the very next scene, the girls are hitchhiking toward a military base. and what a military base it is. actually, it's more like a hog farm converted to look like a military base with plenty of confused extras playing "soldiers." the base commander's office is particularly awesome because there are random things like an ak-47 hanging on the wall and a drill sergeant hat mounted to a plaque (????) so the audience is sure to know that this is a military guy's office. then some random dude pushing a motorcycle shows up and the base commander orders him to go "into town" to buy some porn mags, and to make sure the soldiers don't think that he's on the "pink team." so our character takes a pickup converted to look like an army truck "to town" and loads up a box from a nondescript "book store" with a blowup doll by the front door. the girls hide in the guy's truck when he stops to gas up, and look through the porn stash to find items inside like the "anal invader." i guess that's enough of the plot to scare most people away. plot aside, the sound quality is terrible and the movie is full of cheesy attempts at symbolism, like a radio preacher talking about forbidden fruit during the scene where the "slutty" sister meets the main character for the first time, or how the camera lingers way too long on certain shots to try to convey a "message".if you ever see this for sale or rent or whatever, stay away. it's not worth the money in either case.

this is one of a rarity of movies, where instead of a bowl of popcorn one should watch it with a bottle of vodka. to be completely honest we are a group of people who actually know the man, mo ogrodnik, and decided to drink ourselves stupid to this film.the cinematic aspect of wolfgang something's photography seems to have left out both close-ups and breasts. mo and wolfgang's collaborative effort revealed the passion of the two actresses, plastic peens holding passion. there's also beetle banging. as violet would have put it: "this (plastic peen) goes up your butt". the rat porn and subsequent rat smashing is awesome. alright. so if you are still reading, let us explain who we are. mo ogrodnik teaches at nyu and we are a group of her students, who, finishing a film class with her, decided to get poop- faced and watch here directorial debut. she also wrote uptown girls. i can't tell you how much that's been hammered into our skulls. so this movie is quite the experience. at the very bottom of this post will be a drinking game we created for this movie. about 13 minutes into this game, none of us could see straight. the sheer amount of dido's in the first thirty minutes created enough reasons to drink to pacify an elephant.there was something secretly pleasurable about seeing two underage girls hit on a kurt cobain lookalike with absolutely no context, save for his mysterious scene at the convenience store where he was oh-so-naturally reading a local newspaper. because that's what we all do. the heart-shaped glasses were delightfully derivative of lolita. and something about that provocative scene of the nude chin-up boy suggests the director's history of homosexual pornographic experiments. we wish we were kidding.enough intellectual contemplation. on to the drinking game! this will ensure that the viewing experience is a positive one. it's very simple, and very likely to send at least one member of your party to immediate care.the mo ogrodnik/ripe drinking game: 1. every time you see anything related to pornography, take a drink. 2. every time you see auteur mo ogrodnik's name appear, take a drink. 3. sex. 4. (plastic peen) require two drinks. 5. any time somebody points a gun at another character, take a drink. -at this point you will probably need to refill/pee pee any remaining sobriety from your body.- 6. any time there is blood (including "lady blood"), please take a sip! 7. the underused hula-hoop girl requires one drink per second. 8. gratuitous use of the "magic black man" requires one drink. 9. if you can't figure out the through-line, keep drinking, beyotch. 10. whenever you are able to predict a line, take a drink. trust us. it's easy. that's it, internet! keep drinking, and try not to get riped.-hawaiian smirnoff punch, jr.

ah, the classic genre of 80s sex comedies. this is set on two beaches; one a nude beach featuring myriad (fully) unclothed women. the plot? something about a bunch of dimwits attempting to get laid. the usual. fans of gratuitous t&a (and p) should hunt this one down.

the tv show was slow moving and the 'offbeat' characters were sometimes irritating. only through the miracle of fast forward was i able to make it through the first 2 hours. the write-up indicates that it's some kind of comedy/mystery but i didn't see much of either. if it really picks up after the first 2 hours, please let me know, because i doubt that i will watch the rest without a recommendation.this review is supposed to be without spoilers so i will continue in a vague, non-spoiler, fashion. i found the two main characters uninteresting and unsympathetic. i found myself asking 'would a normal adult do that?' the man with the hedge trimmer looking out the window was irritating and when the male lead interacted with him, he looked pathetic. would a normal adult put up with someone as irritating as him?

now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda. it came no wonder for me that this is admired by most american viewers and hated by europeans. this show is made for americans - it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere. almost everyone involved must be return to school, acting is utterly predictable and bad, script is pile of garbage all round. operator work is ground zero etc. etc.you have been warned. it doesn't even have "guilty pleasure" entertainment for those brainwashed iq=0 human beings.i wish i could enter negative values, admins? anyone?

i thought this series was going to be another fun, action series with some dynamic plots and great performances. i was wrong. while i like jamie denton, this show is hardly worth watching at all, unless you enjoy watching some people brutalized and the actions of the agents supposedly warranted under the theme of "national security." the show is great propaganda for the current government, and spews out jingoism as though we talk that way every day. after a couple of episodes, it was boring the hell out of me, and i started watching reruns of house invaders on bbcamerica instead. rather watch csi and without a trace, without a doubt.

in watching enterprise for the first time, as we all no doubt do with all shows, i went into it with an open mind, enjoying about half of the past star trek efforts and disliking the other half.enterprise has fallen short, but this episode "a night in sickbay" made me seriously question why i bother tivoing the shows from monday night on sci fi.masking some idea that it is one of those 'a day in the life' episodes, in which we learn about what makes certain characters operate as humanoids, the writers seemed to forget that this was supposed to be a starship vessel, not the ricardoes and the mertzes.a planet, especially one whose people had been offended previously by the enterprise crew (for eating in public), was no place for a dog. as an animal lover myself, i would have never taken one of my pets into an environment that had proved in the past to be tense.but what made this episode even more ridiculous was the endless problem with all of these st shows, constantly depicting things that are sacred and insulting to other cultures, as tho they are offering some insight into american religious zealots.the aliens were now offended when the dog urinated on a sacred tree, yet the aliens were quite capable of taking the dog urinating as an insult.strange how the dog's urinating wasn't regarded as some form of worship. i wonder how that one got by the show's writers.from there, we are subjected to a captain who was misguided by his duties. in watching the episode, i found it very easy to forget that bakula was supposed to be the ship's captain.he chose to sleep in sickbay and from there we are given more inanities of behavior (sigh) that we aren't supposed to understand and that causes us to furrow brows.the doctor non-chalantly clips long, hairy toenails and feeds them to hungry caged animals. ewwwwww! then a white bat creature escapes.oh, how is anyone supposed to sleep with all of this going on! toenail clipping, for crying out loud! i was waiting for something that feeds on vomit to be presented.then we were inexplicably given some idea that the captain was in love with t'pol, and that perhaps he was masking those feelings with his concern over the dog.endless amounts of rubbish."your dog is ill, so go have sex. you'll feel better." and of course, the captain had to apologize and we humans had to regard his apology as completely ridiculous, because we are so (everyone smile very sarcastically) narrow-minded! saw depictions such as this endlessly droned out on tng.oddly enough, the only thing missing from this awful episode was that trip person offering his smirks and downhome boyisms, tho bakula seemed to be covering all of that with the silly dog.oh, the dog survived, so now go play fetch.

this episode sucks.over the past few years i have watched all episodes of "next generation" and "voyager" and am now watching "enterprise".i am thoroughly enjoying this series. until this episode. i stared at the screen in horror at the destruction of character and entertainment. it is more like an attempt at slapstick.it does not build the characters but throws them out on a limb - and leaves the audience gasping. it does little to build the series.why this was ever allowed to go to air amazes me. was it the writing? was it the directing? was it the producer? we'll probably never know.but one bad apple isn't bad i suppose. i say that hoping it is only one.

kasparov vs. deep blue is no doubt a fascinating story, but i don't think you'd know it by watching this movie. i think it focuses too much on the conspiracy theory that ibm cheated...and what does this theory hinge upon? the idea that at one point the computer made a move that "looked human". i am not a chess grandmaster or a computer scientist. and while i don't doubt that the move looked human, to me it doesn't seem beyond the realm of possibility that the most powerful chess-playing computer ever created could make a surprising move...or that such a machine could beat even a genius like kasparov. the movie gets way too much mileage out of this theory, and not enough out of the personalities of the people involved...that could have made it a much more interesting story. the direction also relies way too much on the conceits of a pointlessly whispered narration, and the imagery of an 18th century chess-playing machine that looks like one of those animatronic gypsy fortunetellers you see at the carnival. also the story was slowed down by many empty shots of kasparov revisiting "the scene of the crime". i don't doubt that kasparov and the chess community found ibm's behavior vexing, but i don't think it's any different than you would find from any other big corporation. at the end of the movie, you are left with the feeling that kasparov is a huge crybaby and the deep blue programmers are either victims or cheats. i think if the filmmaker wanted the viewer to believe the conspiracy theory (which he almost certainly did), he should have presented a lot more evidence. in fact, more evidence would have been a good idea in the first place. the whole thing left me with a sour taste in my mouth.

this documentary was neither professionally nor objectively made. the whole thing played out like a conspiracy theory by ibm to win the match in question just to make some money. garry kasparov has an ego problem. he was puffed up before the match and when he lost, he didn't like it. i remember playing chess against computers back in the 80s and it wasn't too difficult to win. as time went on, i started to lose and didn't like it. today, i simply don't play against computers anymore because they're just too good. not only that, the games are uninteresting and lack the appeal of human games, where both sides are more likely to err and open the game to exciting possibilities. this documentary keeps showing us images of the turk which is an ancient chess playing automaton that was really controlled by a human being. from the start until the end we are lead to believe that ibm short of literally hid a human gm in the back of their cupboard-sized computer. i'm a computer scientist and take offense at the notion that just because garry lost, ibm must have cheated. i know how computers play chess. it's not magic and it's no mystery. they can be trained, have huge amounts of chess knowledge and they most certainly see positions and possibilities in unprecedented detail compared to humans. it's really no surprise that deep blue won. perhaps at the time it was. if it happened today, given the ever-increasing processing power of machines; people would hardly blink. if a machine couldn't at least draw with a gm today, people would think the program was weak.

being an admitted chess addict, i was excited to see a documentary about the 1997 rematch between garry kasparov and ibm's deep blue supercomputer. i was hoping to see an in depth look at the match and a lot of what kasparov had to say. boy was i wrong and misguided by a mile. this documentary is a lot like many modern documentaries - there is a lot of flash but no real substance. after watching it, i am sad to say, i felt like i wasted my time. one of the most annoying aspects about the documentary is that it does not stay at one place for a decent period of time. it has the typical mtv type editing, where the camera shows different images and quick sound bites from people every five seconds. it is very sad that film-making has been watered down to the attention span of a 10-year old child.i understand it is difficult to make a film about chess, but that does not mean one should make it flashy. 'game over' did have a couple of interesting ideas though. it brought up the idea whether computers can think like human beings or not; whether computers have advanced to a unique new level. this is what kasparov thought after the match, but this film does not go deep enough with this idea. also, this film tries to bring in a bizarre theory. it tries to imply the paranoid that a human being was making the moves along with the help of the computer. kasparov had suspicions about this, but still to this day there is no evidence. towards the end of the film, it tries to imply the bizarre that maybe anatoly karpov might have been the human being who was secretly making the moves with the aid of deep blue. interesting to think about, but i don't know how plausible or realistic it is. i still would not recommend this movie though, not even for chess addicts.

i was disappointed in this documentary.i thought it would be about the second chess match between grandmaster garry kasporov and deep blue the supercomputer designed by ibm computer experts to beat any human chess player.kasparov was and still is,considered the greatest chess player ever.the movie takes us back to 1997 where kasporov had agreed to have a rematch with "deep blue" after defeating it 1 year earlier.but instead of focusing on the game,it focuses more on what happens before and after.there are snippets of the game,but not very many.much of the film centers around kasporov's paranoid obsession that the match was rigged as part of some conspiracy theory and that he lost the match unfairly.the movie also includes interviews with people who are not interesting in any way.they even chat with the manager of the building where the match took place.who cares?i also found it very dry and slow.ultimately this movie was unsatisfying.this is just my opinion,of course.if you like conspiracy theories,this movie might interest you.for people not into chess or conspiracy theories,this movie would probably have no value.i am a chess fan,and i only stuck it out because of that.i give"game over:kasparov and the machine" 4/10

what game over: kasparov and the machine does best is to delve into garry kasparov's psyche during the 1997 competition against ibm's deep blue. you see him becoming more and more paranoid, and increasingly unravelled, all because in the second game, deep blue made a move that seemed too human for his preconceived notion of chess computers. kasparov thought then, and still does, that ibm cheated.game over tries to seem unbiased, but it is clear that the director thinks that ibm cheated. however, they give no real evidence to support the cheating claim, only intimations that ibm's security surrounding the computer room was because ibm really had grandmasters hidden in there overriding the computer on certain key occasions, and kasparov's assertion that the computer didn't play like a computer usually does at one point in game two. in game two, kasparov played a game that was designed to trick the computer, attempting to sacrifice a pawn in a situation where previous computer chess programs would have taken the pawn, leading to the computer's eventual loss. deep blue didn't take the bait, and kasparov was so rattled because the computer seemed to play like a human that he didn't even see that he could have played deep blue to a draw and ended up resigning. that game psyched him out so much that he was unable to recover, and after playing games 3,4, and 5 to draws, lost game 6 horribly.the question of whether ibm cheated all comes down to that single move in game two, where the deep blue made the move that any human would make but that had, up to that point, tripped up computers. joel benjamin, a chess grandmaster on ibm's programming team explained in the documentary that they knew that chess computers always got tripped up in that situation, and consequently spent a lot of time and effort programming deep blue so that it wouldn't make the mistake that other computers do. if you believe benjamin's assertion, then the case is clear, ibm did not cheat. unfortunately, the director quickly moved on and never mentioned ibm's explanation for the rest of the movie, preferring to cut between shots of the chess playing hoax of the 19th century, the turk, and shots of deep blue, hinting that deep blue was really controlled by a human as well. as someone who has an understanding of programming, the explanation by ibm makes perfect sense--if you knew what you were doing, it would not be terribly difficult to put something in the code so that, if thus and so conditions are reached, then do thus and so--in other words, tell the computer what to do if a situation like the one that kasparov created in game 2 ever happened. this isn't cheating, it's doing a good job of programming a chess computer.in the end, it's eminently clear that the director thinks that ibm cheated, and the repeated comments about ibm's stock rising 15% the day that deep blue won suggest the idea that ibm cheated to pump its stock price (kasparov even compares ibm and deep blue to enron). however, there is plenty of outside opinion, within both the chess and computer science communities, that deep blue won fair and square and that kasparov lost because he simply couldn't get past his view of computers as "dumb machines" and got psyched out by a machine that didn't seem so dumb after all. i just wish that the director had let us see the alternative opinion.

i'm writing this note as a chess player as well as as a movie viewer. i watched the 1997 kasparov-deep blue games on the internet. i know something about the issues that were raised. other chess players will come along and want to know whether this movie is worth seeing/buying, and i'm talking largely to them. however, i'll try not to ignore those who aren't "into chess".this movie is about the 1997 match between garry kasparov and the custom-built computer "deep blue". however, the first image you see in the movie is not of kasparov, or of the computer, but of "the turk". this is an "automaton" which was built in europe at the turn of the 18th-19th century and played winning chess against all comers. i put the word "automaton" in quotes because it was, as everyone now knows, a fake. there was a man inside it.if you don't like seeing "the turk", then you won't be able to stand the movie, because "the turk" has as much screen time as kasparov, maybe more, both in modern footage and in b/w footage from some old movie. the reappearance of "the turk" every few seconds underscores kasparov's charge that "deep blue" had human assistance - that it was (to some degree) a fake computer, that ibm cheated, that there was "a man inside it" working behind the scenes to help it win. not only does kasparov believe this, but the filmmakers seem to believe it too. and so this is not really much of a movie about chess games or about programming chess computers. it is a propaganda piece about a big corporation supposedly misusing a helpless grandmaster. really it is a lot like a "negative campaign ad", as it is chock full of ominous music and evocative camera work and spooky sound effects and innuendos ("we never found out what was behind that locked door") and the ever-present "turk".now, most people in the chess community are pretty much convinced that ibm did not cheat and that this was garry's paranoia at work. to start with, in order for a human to help "deep blue" beat kasparov, it would seem that you would need a human who was better than "deep blue" and better than kasparov. since there was no such person, the whole idea is a bit suspect from the start. furthermore, by the time this movie was made, there were computer programs that could run on your pc that could beat strong grandmasters. today, much more than in 1997, we take it for granted that a computer can do things you might not expect. and we are less likely to take it as a monumental human tragedy that a computer beat a guy in chess. (and in fact, the bottom line is that kasparov beat himself with two bad mistakes, including resigning game 2 in a drawn position.) as for the chess games, you actually see very little of them. there are a few comments from masters and commentators that tell briefly how they went, but really you don't get to see hardly any of the strategy or tactics at all. naturally as a chess player i take this as a major shortcoming, but i think that non-players are being cheated too. imagine a baseball movie, for example, where you don't hardly get to see any of the game - just a commentator telling you that "in game four, the white sox defeated the astros with such and such a score." nobody would make a movie like that. but here, for example, we are told that kasparov made a bad blunder in the opening of the decisive game 6, but we aren't shown the position on the screen, or told why it was a blunder, or what he should have done instead, or anything. we just see a few seconds of kasparov holding his head in his hands, and then more atmospheric sound effects and camera work.(since i saw this on dvd, let me warn chess players about the dvd as well. the jacket promises you that the extras include the games "with analysis". is this grandmaster analysis, which people like us might find interesting? no! it is the automated computer voice synthesizer analysis from some version of chessmaster, that tells you when a piece is attacked and a pawn gets isolated and that you are in the "caro-kann defense, main line". blahhhh.) someone might then come along and say, "well, clearly this movie is meant to dramatize the match for the non-player, and so it's unfair to be impatient with it." but actually it doesn't do a very good job of reaching out to the non-player either - it skates over some points that a true novice would really want to have explained. for example it says that kasparov could have gotten "perpetual check" in the second game, but it doesn't explain what that is (or show what it would have looked like on the board, which would have been interesting). it flashes back to the kasparov-karpov matches but doesn't explain why there were two of them or who organized them etc. i didn't need this information myself, but i'm familiar with it. if you don't already have chess experience, there are places where you are going to be confused, and this is just a defect in the film.ultimately i can't recommend the movie, which, like "the turk" itself, is not what it purports to be (a documentary) but more of a stage illusion.

i am a chess player and i wanted to like this film. trouble is, the content could have been fitted in a 30-minute documentary.there were lots of shots of corridors being walked down and kasparov gazing out in the hall where he won the world championship. there were other shots of kasparov being walked round the site of the 1997 match and being told where he sat and where deep blue was located. this just looked like filler.also, i didn't find it interesting to see in detail where deep blue was now and seeing an ibm techie trying, unsuccessfully to 'open' it. what would we have seen of interest inside anyway - a little grandmaster?also, the recent match against karpov. i no longer follow professional chess enough to know when and where this was. it would have been nice to have been told: was this a one-off 'just for the money'? was it part of the world championship cycle? what was the final score? the nub of the film was the play in game two. could/would ibm let kasparov see 'inside' the machine? that's where the focus should have been.

as long as you keep in mind that the production of this movie was a copyright ploy, and not intended as a serious release, it is actually surprising how not absolutely horrible it is. i even liked the theme music.and if ever a flick cried out for a treatment by joel (or mike) and the mst3k bots, this is it! watch this with a bunch of smart-ass wise-crackers, and you're in for a good time. have a brew, butter up some large pretzels, and enjoy.of course, obtaining a copy requires buying a bootleg or downloading it as shareware, but if you're here on the imdb, then you're most likely savvy enough to do so. good luck.and look for my favorite part....where dr. doom informs the ff that they have 12 hours to comply with his wishes....and he actually gestures the number "12" with his finger while doing so....it's like "evil sesame street"....hoo boy....and of course mrs. storm declaring "just look at you....the fanstastic four" is just so heartwarming....you'll laugh, you'll cry.....so if you love schlocky sci-fi, this one's fantastic for you!

yes! this movie was just bad in every way in things like cast,effects,boredom,excitement,and of course,being fantastic and we all know the four heroes in this one were a bit more colourful compared to the new ones but it still has to go,a fantastic bore like this really was just silly trash which i knew nobody would like when i saw it,i mean surely with that budget about 3 or 4 good movies could have been made but no. i am just glad that the new version made this year totally showed everyone how the fantastic four should have been made with good story,great cast like jessica alba one of my favourite actresses otherwise it would have been totally forgotten but thankfully no. the new one was excellent when i saw it with my mates at the cinema but this old fantastic bore has gotta go.

drifting around on bootlegs, sometimes thought an urban comic book legend, the first ff movie is pretty much as bad as everyone fears. i guess marvel comics now pretends it doesn't exist, what with the 2005 version out in theaters earlier this year. but it's out there, a reminder and the last of the first wave of bad, low budget marvel super-hero adaptations (captain america, punisher, most of the tv movies). 'low budget' is too easy a description for this ff pic. due to basically no funds, showing the powers of the super foursome was limited to very quick shots (mr.fantastic), quasi-animation (torch), and fades (invisible girl-the easiest to do). the thing suit was not bad and probably half the budget; the face part was especially almost convincing. the acting? alex hyde-white as reed is pretty good; the other 3 are ok, tho jay as johnny acts like a spaz at times to sort of show off his 'fiery' temper. the dialog is comic-book style, and it's the supporting cast which ends up floundering trying to make it work. dr.doom is way over melodramatic and unintentionally comical, and his two main henchmen are a case study of how not to act or write dialog.the plot? not too good. it was quite faithful to the origin story of the ff (more so than the later big budget version), and even though the non-budget, again, restricted showing, for example, the actual crash landing, it kept the essential ingredients of how they discovered their powers in an isolated area - it's the best part of the picture, tho you have to wait a full half-hour for it. i also found the music odd in places; when the 4 are bathed in those cosmic rays, a kind of church choir is heard, as if it's a religious experience. the rest of it, however, is hopeless. even with no budget, the story could have done without the jeweler character (resembling the mole man villain of the books); it spends way too much time with him and his underground gang, as well as the blind alicia. these sections are a waste of celluloid and very boring. the climactic struggle with doom & his men starts fine, but degenerates into an awful mess as the torch races a laser beam (cool animation but belonging in a cartoon). fans can have a laugh at the bad ff fx and witless storyline, if they don't get depressed & outraged first.

this is truly awful, the feeblest attempt at a comics adaptation ever committed to film. every possible thing about this movie that could be bad, is. music, acting, lighting, sets, "special" effects... about the only positives i can find are that sue looks cute in her blue tights and that the thing make-up is almost passable (face only). that's it. zip. don't bother tracking down that bootleg copy; it's really not worth your time. even the aborted "captain america" movie from the early 90's is far less excruciating than squirming in your seat while you try to endure this mess.

without a doubt this is the worse comicbook movie every made. period!! yes, it's worse then dolph lundgren's (1989) punisher. yup.. worse then the 1979 & 1991 captain america movies. oh yeah, it's even worse then christopher reed scripted superman iv: quest for peace movie. sheeshh.. that movie was so bad that the guy who played nuclear man only starred in one other film and it was only on t.v. =opthis movie is "d" quality. i had a chance to watch it on the scifi channel back in 1997. i had heard it was pretty bad, but had nothing else to do that night so i figured i check it out. what a waste of an hour and a half. i would have been better off watching reruns of different strokes. besides having the lamest special effects and worse acting i've ever seen, the whole script was just awful and not well directed at all. thankfully a new fantastic four movie is being done and hopefully this version will do the heroes justice. i was hoping for a new spawn movie in the future, but it has yet to materialize. do not rent this movie. if you happen to see it being televised on cable, check it out. be warned though, you'll most like be flipping the channel after the first 15 mins.

i have always loved bad creations, rhetorical criticism and my film professor validated that for me in college. this is not as bad as the star wars holiday special, there is nothing bottom of the lunchbox than that mistake. this the fantastic four film, complete with the i-have-no-idea-why-hes-excessively-tweaking-his-fingers doctor doom, is high on the list of colossal mistakes. doom's dialogue "kill him!...let him go!" is classic as it is staggering in its hilarity. the editing is good, and the director of photography isn't half-bad...those are the up-sides. i cannot, however, subject all my friends to watch in its entirety, but if i can get the chance i show them the "can jonny and sue come to outer space with us!" scene i do. i also include the final scene scene, where redd richards in his ff outfit for some reason, alongside his bride sue in her wedding dress, get into the limo...the payoff is the extendo arm in farewell as they drive away. most people are in complete disbelief that something like this exists.

this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life .period.this movie goes beyond ridiculous,it is like the director wants to get his ass sued by the actors for wrongfully misrepresenting their roles as the fantastic four,i believe the movie should have been released in comic book stores in order for the only how u should say it,desperate geeks who cant get enough cheesiness and want to see more and more crap movies.in conclusion to my paradox statements and thesis,i do believe this movie has had great disadvantages to the futures of the cast's contributors,with the exception of jay underwood's character,in which i do believe it was his best performance,considering roles such as the not quite human movies in which the story is told in a way that he has no character.he cant act,and people have made good decisions to not go see his movies,this is why he is most likely not going to be any huge roles,unless he sparks his career in a most rare,but interesting way.

zipperface is the kind of experience one waits an entire lifetime to avoid! mansour pormand ranks as one of the worst film directors of all time! if, however, you love bad films, see this at all costs!

the first thing you should know about "zipperface" is that it was shot on video, so it has that peculiar "home-video-ish" look that is terribly distracting and makes it hard to take this seriously as a "real" film. and "zipperface" indeed looks as if a bunch of amateurs got together for an attempt at a "real" serial-killer thriller. it's not quite that, but it's not as bad as it looks, either. having a woman as one of the two detectives on the case puts a spin on the exploitation genre. dona adams gives an appealingly amateurish performance in the role - her obvious inexperience in front of the camera somehow works for her. plus, she puts up a great fight against the killer at the end. the red herrings appear ludicrous at first, but ultimately they work - i guessed the killer incorrectly. and you have to wonder if perhaps tarantino had seen the zipperface guy when he came up with the idea of "the gimp" for "pulp fiction". (*1/2)

wow! this is the movie that should be shown on tv at two in the morning on cinemax for all those insomniacs (lord knows they'd probably pass out from boredom watching this movie) terrible acting, the killer is quite far from scary, i've seen clowns at carnivals that were scarier. lot's of unnecessary 'skin' in this film, pseudo-porn scenes which are just horrible in more ways than a million, a gawdy soap opera style script which really hurt the movie and the director really had no flair for whatever genre he was trying to create with this film. i could see a group of teenagers with their parents camcorders doing better work than this. i don't think there is a part of me that could recommend this film to anyone...

creepy facemasks and slasher movies have gone together like cheese and chives throughout the lengthy lifespan of the cycle. people often assume that it was john carpenter that started the trend, but as is the case with many of the genre's clichés - the italians did it first. movies like eyeball, torso and blood and black lace were the originators of a hooded maniac in a murder mystery. there were also a couple of american pre-halloween slashers that warrant a mention. classroom massacre, keep my grave open and savage weekend clearly pre-date 1978, whilst the town that dreaded sundown is widely regarded as one of the first teen-kill movies. carpenter's seminal flick may not have been the maiden masked nightmare, but it certainly started the competitive race between directors to unveil the spookiest disguise for their bogeymen. over the years we've seen some memorable contenders, but my favourites would have to be: my bloody valentine's maniacal miner, the prowler's sadistic soldier and wicked games' copper-faced assassin. i'm also keen on many of the killer clowns that have made an appearance throughout the category. the final scene in the house on sorority row has to be listed as one of the best and the clown of midnight also ranks highly amongst the greatest madmen's costumes.a leather mask was probably the last type to be used in a slasher movie, probably because they are widely linked with sexual perversion, which of course doesn't exactly make for a scary disguise. but in later years both blackout and this obscurity decided that fear could certainly be incorporated with a gimp suit. here's how the later of the two fared the screen lights up with the rush of blue sirens, as cops race to the scene of a hostage situation. it seems that a stressed-out gentleman has possibly had enough of being cast as an extra in cruddy low-brow turkeys, so he's decided to hold his wife and kid at gunpoint. detective shine (david clover) manages to wrestle with the gunman, but unluckily for him he looses the fight to grab a loose pistol and it looks like it's the end of the road for the grey haired officer. fortunately he is saved in the nick of time by some precision marksmanship from lisa ryder (donna adams), the california police department's hottest female law-enforcer.her heroic encounter earns the brunette a promotion to detective first class, and its a feat that is heavily envied by her male counterparts. meanwhile a leather-clad maniac is jollying around town slaughtering hookers and dumping their bloody corpses on street corners. ryder and shine are put on the case of the murderous gimp and their first call of questioning is a sleazy back street photographer called michael walker (john mandell). lisa is such a top notch inspector that normal police regulation doesn't seem to apply to her, so before long she's dating the cameraman even though he's suspect numero uno. when the bodies continue to pile up around the city, she decides to go undercover in an attempt to flush out the s & m madman if anything, zipperface effortlessly sums up all that went wrong with the slasher genre towards the end of its rein. what started as a great stepping-stone for up and coming filmmakers and thespians had been reduced to a sewer of cinema faeces by movies with flat direction, zero suspense or shocks and talentless mediocre actors. the boom years of early eighties splatter flicks managed to conceal their lack of strong dramatic line-ups with gooey special effects and exciting directorial flourishes. unfortunately, by this point in the cycle titles like rush week, deadly dreams and the majorettes had seemed to be produced in a conspiracy to put the category where many of the aforementioned feature's characters ended up. in an early grave.donna adams doesn't even vaguely convince as an officer of the law and her inexplicably idiotic behaviour - which includes doing a striptease for a top suspect in a nationwide murder investigation - is more mind numbingly pathetic than you might ever expect it to be. mansour pourmand couldn't direct traffic and the wide majority of the cast members would struggle to get a second reading for a radio commercial. i searched and searched, but found nothing here of merit or note.on the plus side, if you manage to keep the tv turned on until the end then you may be fairly surprised by the killer's identity. to be honest though, i doubt that by that time you'll even care. and another plus point? well, erm.... the disc is perfectly symmetrical, which means that you could use it as a matt to place your cup of tea upon?? aside from that there's really no other reason to go out and buy zipperface. bad bad bad and not in a good way, this is 90 minutes of my life that i could have spent more constructively by plucking my chest-hair. abysmal.

heftig og begeistret (intense and enthusiastic) is a documentary-like story of a male choir up in berlevåg in the very northern part of norway, where the weather is cold and hostile, the days are dark during the winter and the towns are faced with young people moving to the more populated parts in the south of norway, where the climate is warmer and there are more opportunities.the most beautiful part of this movie is the humans themselves. the people in the choir, who are aged from 30 to 95, all have unique, colorful lives and are very enjoyable beings. they are characterised by the harsh climate and the recession of the north and have adapted to the way of living required. throughout the movie, we learn a bit about many people in the choir and we follow them through songs, some events in a church and on the harbour, and in the end, a trip to murmansk.the outside environment filmed in the movie is very beautiful and characterised by the norwegian nature. the scenography is also natural and taken directly from the choir and from the peoples lives that we meet. thei r livingrooms, the bathroom, the kettle on the oven; there is nothing artificial about this movie, not the people, not the environment, not their music and not their feelings. everything is as real as can be.it all loses out though when it comes to giving a story. it is very beautiful and real, but why do we see it? is it because of the songs? is it because of the nature? or is it simply just to see a story about berlevåg mens-choir, about their life and some of the trips they have. the message, if there is any, is that this small society copes with life through such social events like the choir. the choir have kept the people together for many many years.it is all nice, but being as popular as it has been, seen by almost 200.000 in norway, there is something wrong. there is no beginning or end to it. nobody gains or loses anything, nobody reveals any message or tries to convince the audience of that this is good or that life up there is great. why was this movie made?i am sorry. it is a nice movie about good people, but compared to the average european, scandinavian or norwegian movie - this does not deserve a 9 out of 10. it is closer to 4 out of 10, and that is what i will give it.if you see this movie in a theater, you should expect the average age on the audience to be around 55-60. it has reported to be consistently high in all theaters. maybe this is also the reason for it receiving such very high praise in the news and good grades also on the imdb: it is a movie about elders, for elders. it is a movie of "i regret nothing in my life", and a story saying that living in a small town like berlevåg, might be a nice life too.
