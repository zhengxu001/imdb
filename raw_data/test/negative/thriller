a funny thing happened to me while watching "mosquito": on the one hand, the hero is a deaf-mute and the director is totally unable to make us understand why he does what he does (mutilating mannequins...er, excuse me, corpses) through his images. on the other hand, the english version at least is very badly dubbed. so i found myself wishing there had been both more and less dialogue at the same time! this film is stupid (funny how this guy has access to every graveyard and mortuary in his town) and lurid (where would we be in a 70s exploitationer without our gratuitous lesbian scene?). not to mention the "romantic" aspect (oh, how sweet!)...miss it. (*)

this german horror film has to be one of the weirdest i have seen.i was not aware of any connection between child abuse and vampirism, but this is supposed based upon a true character.our hero is deaf and mute as a result of repeated beatings at the hands of his father. he also has a doll fetish, but i cannot figure out where that came from. his co-workers find out and tease him terribly.during the day a mild-manner accountant, and at night he breaks into cemeteries and funeral homes and drinks the blood of dead girls. they are all attractive, of course, else we wouldn't care about the fact that he usually tears their clothing down to the waist. he graduates eventually to actually killing, and that is what gets him caught.like i said, a very strange movie that is dark and very slow as werner pochath never talks and just spends his time drinking blood.

being a long-time fan of japanese film, i expected more than this. i can't really be bothered to write to much, as this movie is just so poor. the story might be the cutest romantic little something ever, pity i couldn't stand the awful acting, the mess they called pacing, and the standard "quirky" japanese story. if you've noticed how many japanese movies use characters, plots and twists that seem too "different", forcedly so, then steer clear of this movie. seriously, a 12-year old could have told you how this movie was going to move along, and that's not a good thing in my book.fans of "beat" takeshi: his part in this movie is not really more than a cameo, and unless you're a rabid fan, you don't need to suffer through this waste of film.2/10

"tokyo eyes" tells of a 17 year old japanese girl who falls in like with a man being hunted by her big bro who is a cop. this lame flick is about 50% filler and 50% talk, talk, and more talk. you'll get to see the less than stellar cast of three as they talk on the bus, talk and play video games, talk and get a haircut, talk and walk and walk and talk, talk on cell phones, hang out and talk, etc. as you read subtitles waiting for something to happen. the thin wisp of a story is not sufficient to support a film with low end production value, a meager cast, and no action, no romance, no sex or nudity, no heavy drama...just incessant yadayadayada'ing. (c-)

wealthy horse ranchers in buenos aires have a long-standing no-trading policy with the crawfords of manhattan, but what happens when the mustachioed latin son falls for a certain crawford with bright eyes, blonde hair, and some perky moves on the dance floor? 20th century-fox musical has a glossy veneer yet seems a bit tatty around the edges. it is very heavy on the frenetic, gymnastic-like dancing, exceedingly thin on story. betty grable (an eleventh hour replacement for alice faye) gives it a boost, even though she's paired with leaden don ameche (in tan make-up and slick hair). also good: charlotte greenwood as betty's pithy aunt, a limousine driver who's constantly asleep on the job, and carmen miranda playing herself (who else?). the stock shots of argentina far outclass the action filmed on the fox backlot, and some of the supporting performances are quite awful. by the time of the big horserace finale, most viewers will have had enough. *1/2 from ****

cage plays a drunk and gets high critically praise. elizabeth shue actually has to do a love seen with the most unattractive and overrated piece of dung flesh in hollywood. i literally vomited while watching this film. of course i had the flu, but that does not mean this film did not contribute to the vomit in the kamode. why can't nick cage play something he can really pull off like a bad actor. nick cage who be brilliant in a role as a bad actor. heck nobody could do it better.the search begins for nick's contract with lucifer or was it lou cipher from "night train to terror".

so tell me - what serious boozer drinks budweiser? how many suicidally-obsessed drinkers house a fully stocked and barely touched range of drinks in their lonely motel room that a millionaire playboy's bachelor-pad bar would be proud to boast? and what kind of an alcoholic tends to drink with the bottle held about 8 inches from his hungry mouth so that the contents generally spill all over his face? not to mention wasting good whisky by dousing your girlfriend's tits with it, just so the cinema audience can get a good eyeful of elisabeth shue's assets.cage seems to be portraying the most attention-seeking look-at-me alcoholic ever to have graced the screen while shue looks more like a berkely preppy slumming it for a summer than some seasoned street-walker. she is humiliated and subjugated as often as possible in this revolting movie with beatings, skin lacerations, anal rape and graphic verbal abuse - all of it completely implausible and included apparently only to convey a sense of her horribly demeaned state and offer the male viewers an astonishingly clichéd sentimental sexual fantasy of the 'tart-with-a-heart'.still - i did watch it to the end, by which time i was actually laughing out loud as shue's tough street hooker chopped carrots in the kitchen wanly, pathetically smiling while cage - all eyes popping and shaking like like a man operating a road drill in an earthquake - grimaced and mugged his way through the final half-hour...

a big disappointment for what was touted as an incredible film. incredibly bad. very pretentious. it would be nice if just once someone would create a high profile role for a young woman that was not a prostitute. we don't really learn anything about this character, except that he seems to be a hopeless alcoholic. we don't know why. nicholas cage turns in an excellent performance as usual, but i feel that this role and this script let him down. and how, after not being able to perform for the whole film, can he have an erection on his deathbed? really terrible and i felt like i needed a bath.

this film is absolutely appalling and awful. it's not low budget, it's a no budget film that makes ed wood's movies look like art. the acting is abysmal but sets and props are worse then anything i have ever seen. an ordinary subway train is used to transport people to the evil zone of killer mutants, woddy strode has one bullet and the fight scenes are shot in a disused gravel pit. there is sadism as you would expect from an 80s italian video nasty. no talent was used to make this film. and the female love interest has a huge bhind- italian taste maybe. even for 80s italian standards this film is pretty damn awful but i guess it came out at a time when there weren't so many films available on video or viewers weren't really discerning. this piece of crap has no entertainment value whatsoever and it's not even funny, just boring and extremely cheap. it's actually and insult to the most stupid audience. i just wonder how on earth an actor like woody strode ended up ia a turkey like this?

here's a decidedly average italian post apocalyptic take on the hunting/killing humans for sport theme ala the most dangerous game, turkey shoot, gymkata and the running man.certainly the film reviewed here is nowhere near as much fun as the other listed entries and is furthermore dragged down by poor voice over work, generally bland action sequences, a number of entirely tasteless scenes such as a prolonged rape sequence and some truly stupid and illogical points throughout.take for example towards the end of the film, when our hero manages to infiltrate the compound of the villains. he initially kills a sentry and leaves him in his jeep. upon discovery of the said corpse, the villains response? (bearing in mind that our hero has come to brutally murder them all)  they resolve to wait until the next morning to look for the culprit (!!!!!!!!!!)however, i suppose to be fair the film remains nonetheless about watchable if you can suspend your disbelief during such stupid scenes and does benefit immensely by the presence of the always excellent woody strode (even if his screen time is very limited)not a classic by any stretch of the imagination but still just about worthy of a watch for italian b-movie enthusiasts.

at the bottom end of the apocalypse movie scale is this piece of pish called 'the final executioner'.. at least where i come from. a bloke is trained by an ex-cop to seek vengeance on those that killed his woman and friends in cold blood.. and that's about it. lots of fake explosions and repetitive shootings ensue. has one of the weirdest array of costumes i've seen in a film for a while, and a massive fortress which is apparently only run by 7 people. great job on the dubbing too guys(!) best moment: when our hero loses a swordfight and is about to be skewered through the neck, he just gets out his gun and bang! why not do that earlier? it's a mystery. as is why anyone would want to sit through this in the first place. i'm still puzzling over that one myself now.. 2/10

earth has been destroyed in a nuclear holocaust. well, parts of the earth, because somewhere in italy, a band of purebred survivors--those without radioactive contamination--are holed up in a massive mansion surrounded by lush grounds, waiting for the next opportunity to go hunting for those with polluted blood. the final executioner is the story of one of their would be victims, alan (william mang, who looks, not surprisingly, a lot like kurt russell), and his efforts to take down the legally sanctioned hunters, who are led by edra (marina costa) and erasmus (harrison muller jr. ). alan has been trained to kill by former nypd cop sam (woody strode) who mostly hangs around giving his pupil moral support and mooching for tinned meat. strode is by far the best thing about the film, though he doesn't look at all well and only appears for about a third of the running time. as for the story, it's a blending of elements from better films and stories, including ten little indians, the most dangerous game, and escape from new york. the final executioner moves along at a fair pace and provides reasonable entertainment for less discriminate action fans.

many people are standing in front of the house n some women are crying... men standing in close groups and speaking in hushed up tone... a couple of guys come in and they are discussing how sexy the daughter might look today... soon u will know someone in the house has died... the dead person's wife is worried about preparing food for so many people, her friend sitting beside her gives an idea of making the matters easy by preparing simple roti sabji... one of the dead person's son is speaking with someone over the mobile, daughter is busy with her makeup... her mother suggests her to wear salwar kameej, but the daughter is more interested in looking good when so many people will be visiting their house and hence prefers jeans and t shirt over salwar kameez... another son asks her mom to finish all the kriyas and also indicates to her that he should not be expected to come early from the office... then the camera slowly focuses on the dead person... the white cloth covering the face is displaced slightly due to the wind, revealing the face ... its anupam kher... suddenly alarm rings and he gets up from the bed... is it his dream or a flash back? u won't get an answer until the end of the movie...well, this is wat comedy is for the director dibakar banerjee!!!!! later u find out this scene has nothing to do with the actual movie and hence making everything obvious that the still described earlier was a dream. is this a film comedy? well it is supposed to belong to that category... but it actually does not!!! there is nothing that can be remotely associated with comedy in the movie!!! more over the director gives the message that no one will get justice from police!!! so everyone must cheat the cheats!!!! or forget about justice!!!! music by bapi-tutul & dhruv dhalla is ok... nothing much to tell about other sectors... bad script destroys everything... not even anupam kher's performance succeeds in making it at least a paisa vasool...

new york family is the last in their neighborhood to get a television set, which nearly ruins david niven's marriage to mitzi gaynor. bedroom comedy that rarely ventures into the bedroom(and nothing sexy happens there anyway). gaynor as an actress has about as much range as an oven--she turns on, she turns off. film's sole compensation is a supporting performance by perky patty duke, pre-"miracle worker", as niven's daughter. she's delightful; "happy anniversary" is not. * from ****

the best thing about "the prey" is the tag line..."it's not human and it's got an axe"! the movie itself is a padded stinkaroo....endless insect and wildlife shots make the viewer wanna die! no slasher fan will like this garbage.....watch "friday the 13th" again and burn any copy of this film you find! it also rates as one of the 25 worst films ever made!

this is truly, without exaggerating, one of the worst slasher movies ever made. i know, it came out in the 80's following a tendency started by "friday the 13th". "the prey" copies the fore-mentioned movie in many aspects. the woods setting, the killer, the dumb teens, the gore, etc.but "the prey" is as bad as you might expect. i didn't even remember about it if it wasn't for coincidence.well, the killer is in fact human so don't expect a supernatural killer in the likes of jason. the situations rather boring and lack of tension, gore, violence, etc. it just does not works for a slasher flick.the acting is simply horrid. the score is horrible! a combination of boring instruments with cheesy 80's tunes?! i won't even mention the technical aspects of the movie because believe me, it seems that it cost only 20 dollars.please avoid this one like the plague. it's one of the worst movies i've ever seen, and that's something to say. thank god it seems to have vanished from earth.

this movie is nothing more than christian propaganda. it started off like a good sci-fi movie and then works a syrupy sweet christian theme into the story which is totally unrelated. i had to turn it off half way through because i felt tricked into renting it. the catholic church has officially announced that aliens do not contradict belief in god.the movie is slightly entertaining despite this but the dialog is unbelievable, writing and acting is mostly rubbish and all in all, this movie is mostly a stinker to be avoided.there was obviously some research done into the phenomenon by the filmmakers, but then you quickly realize that it is only for the purpose to debunk and inject their own paranoid religious views into a valid interesting subject. if you are a zealous religious fanatic who believes in demons and angels , you will love this movie.

this movie starts really good.after half of the movie it wraps to a religious christian crap.some really christian with psycho problems are talking about good and believe in christ - or you go to hell.don't watch it - it's pure propaganda and its pure wrong ...this movie starts really good.after half of the movie it wraps to a religious christian crap.some really christian with psycho problems are talking about good and believe in christ - or you go to hell.don't watch it - it's pure propaganda and its pure wrong ...

my wife spotted this film on the aisle at a local video store. from the cover it looked like a science-fiction film, but upon turning it over my wife saw rebecca st. james was in the film, realized it was a christian movie, and suggested we watch it. we are conservative evangelicals but we also know that "christian" films have a poor reputation in the mainstream. nevertheless, we decided to give it a screening.to be fair, there were a few things i liked about the film. the musical score - much of which was orchestrated - was quite good. the cinematography was also pretty good considering it was a lower-budget movie.unfortunately, any virtue in this film's production work was lost on a regrettable script. the film begins with an interesting premise - ufo abductions - but by midway through the feature the storyline veers wildly into an evangelistic crusade spearheaded by the movie's two main characters... which then veers wildly into a treatise on the rapture. at least the frank peretti-inspired "the visitation" (which was itself a deeply flawed film) had an endgame that tied together the movie's premise. "unidentified" ends nowhere even close to where it started, which is a huge letdown.as for the acting? the supporting acting ranges from decent to awful. (rebecca st. james plays a bit part and is passable.) for their part, a few of the main characters are manned capably enough. sadly, their talents are wasted on characters so one-dimensional in their personalities so as to be unbelievable. the "protagonists" are anything but; you know it's bad when two christian viewers find the most vocal christian character in the film to be the most annoying.a final note on the evangelistic tone of this movie, which will be of more interest to christian than non-christian readers. in a word, it is embarrassing. other christian films like carmen's "the champion" and peretti's "the hangman's curse" have managed to communicate a genuinely uncompromising portrait of the christian faith without sounding preachy or oppressive. this film, by contrast, is a sledgehammer that feels so heavy-handed and lacking in tact that a non-christian would have a hard time taking it seriously.i do believe that the filmmaker's heart is in the right place, and i applaud efforts to create good christian film. unfortunately, this is not one of them. if your church is looking for a screening of a good christian film, consider "mercy streets," the aforementioned "the champion," or (if you're pentecostal) robert duvall's provocative "the apostle." as for "unidentified?" rent it if you must, but screen it before you show it to a non-christian or a larger audience.

first of all, i have nothing against christianity. i believe, every person has the right to believe what he or she chooses. but i cannot imagine how dumb a person has to be to believe this! what a waste of believers' money. they'd better use it to feed some starving families in the third world countries. i don't want to talk about talk acting or plot of this "movie", because i couldn't find any of those in this. story's simple - two reporters, one (a) is atheist, the other (b) for some sake has abandoned religion. b regains his confidence in religion and teaches a a lesson - believe in christ or go to hell. this message appears after like ten minutes and keeps repeating to the end of the movie. people, do not believe the rating of this "movie", read reviews first. i didn't and wasted an hour of my life :( ps: why is it classified as sci-fi? because of those few weird sounds and a bit of bright light from the sky? pps: u.f.o. = satan's evil doings? that's a new one :)

supposedly, a movie about a magazine sending journalists to investigate reports of ufos with one being more or less tolerant or agnostic about the whole affair and the other an aussie, a hardened skeptic who laughs at the ufo nonsense. it's all a crock, some kind of money making racket.turns out this movie is actually a deceit, and a trap to actually promulgate christian teachings and the christian explanation of ufos, one i've heard before. this is an ad hoc explanation that is itself not at all biblical but invented by certain modern theologians who can fit anything and everything into their mythology. the paranormal? it's real, just demonic, unless it takes place in a christian context, then of course, it is of god. simple, if it isn't of god, it's the of the devil, stupid! so i suppose since beethoven's 9th symphony wasn't inspired by god, it must have been written under demonic influence. or so would the logic lead ad absurdum.we are informed that since the bible does not tell of life on other planets in the universe, therefore there is none (a version of the ad ignorantium fallacy) and that god created the universe so huge, so grand to show us his almighty power. i think of carl sagan's remark that if god created such a huge universe and stuck life only on earth it'd have been a tremendous waste of space.so what are ufos? they are demonic activity and concern the soon to be earthshaking christian event, the rupture...i mean rapture. before the tribulation, the true christians will disappear from the face of the earth en masse causing mass panic, confusion, car and plane crashes...whatever. therefore satan knowing this is sending his demons to basically create an illusion of alien spacecraft and alien abduction which can then be used to explain away this otherwise inexplicable event. all part of satan's plan which will of course keep people from looking to god or jesus and fall for the lies of the antichrist.this ad hoc explanation also typifies theological mishmash by explaining away one mystery with another, in opposition to the scientific method of explaining the unknown, the strange, and the mysterious in as much as possible, first by the known, if not solely by the known.it's like jumping straight to an alien abduction whenever a child is missing and unaccounted for. i think i'd look first at more mundane explanations like the child has run away, gotten lost, or been kidnapped for ransom or abducted by a predatory pedophile before invoking aliens, or the supernatural or satan or some such.this kind of deceit or trap on the part of fundamentalists is nothing new, as young people are often lured to free rock concerts, that may start out with something innocuous then suddenly switch to overt christian music, followed by a sermon and an altar call. this kind of blatant deception one might think would be more satan's ballgame. but maybe because the christian faith is soon to be in its death throes, these guys feel that anything goes, any deception or trickery or scare tactics are acceptable to try to keep the faith alive, which is facing serious opposition from both secularists as well as competing faiths like islam, the world's fastest growing religion which may well replace christianity, as islam is far more cohesive and unified, and logically more tenable than christian fundamentalism. although this should offer little advantage to mankind, as it would be replacing one intolerant thought system with another.and of course the movie ends more or less with a variant of pascal's wager. the atheistic aussie who is skeptical about just about everything is told. well, if you are right about there being no afterlife and death is nothing but rotting in the grave, no worry...but what if you're wrong?basically, statements implying that reality is going to conform to nothing but an atheistic viewpoint or christian fantasy, is a false dilemma or black and white fallacy. even if the atheists are wrong would not necessarily make christianity correct by default, nor if christianity turns out to be full of holes in its theology, that the materialistic atheists are therefore correct by default.for all we know, native american spirituality might turn out to be the best description of ultimate reality and we might all of use have wished we treated the earth and its creatures a wee bit better.this movie should be stamped right on the box: caution: contains religious propaganda and not meant for informative or entertainment purposes.

saw this last night and being a fan of the first demons, i had hoped that the sequel would have the same fun, spooky spirit of it's predecessor. this is unfortunately not the case. the set-up is similar as the first, in which a horde of flesh-eating demons burst forth into reality by being released from a horror movie being played... (the first had been a movie theater, this one takes place in an apartment building and on tv.) once the demons are released, madness and mass carnage ensues. that's pretty much it as far as plot development goes. it worked nicely in the first part because of the ghoulish make-up fx, fast pace and unpredictability. the sequel, however, doesn't cut it. the first problem seems to be that there are way too many characters who we don't really care about one way or another. if they were annoying or idiots, then there would at least be some kind of gratification when they are inevitably butchered/demonized/eaten alive...but these people are just kind of there waiting to be slaughtered. plus, the fact that most of the characters are in different parts of the apartment building (and out of it), they are constantly cutting back and forth between them, which kept pulling me out of the story. there are some amusing bits, courtesy of the splatter fx and campiness. such as a constant flow of dripping blood eating through one floor's construction after another as if it were alien acid... the first demon possession of a crabby birthday girl leads to the destruction of her entire party, and a creepy demon child clawing his way into the room of a tenant who is pregnant with child. however, that sequence parlays into a ridiculous-looking rubber demon baby puppet thing that bursts from the chest of the human child that constantly flies across the room at its intended victim. i got a couple of chuckles out of that scene, but i don't think that was bava's intention. the scene probably would've worked better if they just kept the child demon around to attack the woman, but hey... other little things like the over-zealous acting of most of the characters and the bad dubbing don't help matters. in summation, i managed to see the unrated version on dvd, and can't imagine having to sit all the way through the previously only available r rated version, because the make-up fx and gore were the only thing i got out of it. also notable is an early role of producer argento's future hottie daughter, asia. in fact, she probably gives the best performance of the whole cast and she's barely on screen. argento/bava fan's might want to check it out just to see it, but will probably find themselves looking at their watch, like i did. gore fans might get a kick out of some of the fx, but will be laughing themselves out of their chairs at the most goofy-looking evil baby puppet since little selwyn from dead/alive. you could do worse, but it certainly doesn't live up to the original.

the films use of blue-black and vibrant skin tones to create a noir-ish feel to this movie unfortunately do not work. in fact its quite irritating as it obscures the demon characters and reduces them to one dimensional beings.at least the original had an hysterical energy and the gore set-pieces were quite stunning. black gore is hardly frightening, nor is the main female demon at all frightening in her attempts to snarl and growl at the screen in her best camp lugosi style.the narrative is grossly disjointed and if you could imagine 'naked lunch' directed by russ meyer you may appreciate the attempt to be william burroughs-esque. otherwise give this film a wide girth. bava and argento fans - once again - are bitterly disappointed.

this film sucks!! it looks like they just chose to place scenes together at random. good gore, but little plot. sally whines and complains about everything till she becomes a demon. i figured that she had pms. it sure seemed that way. the dubbing in this film is horrible. one scene the woman was talking and a few seconds before we hear any audio. i knew at that moment my suspicions were correct that it was not from the us. i tried to follow along but got lost about half way through it and found it very hard to believe, even for a horror film. some good characters, but not many. not worth wasting one's time.

(spoilers more than likely... nothing really important you couldn't have figured out yourselves) yeah, it's really weird. i rented it at a blockbuster for the reason it had absolutely no description of the movie on the back of the box, only a list of the bands that had songs in it. but after that, i had a dikens of a time finding it, even here on imdb. i kept confusing it with "night of the demons," but, you know, they're basically the same thing. the parts i loved most about this movie was the whole thing in the garage. that black gym guy was hilarious the way he screamed all the time. even when screaming wasn't really necessary, he'd let out a "listen up now!! block the door with cars!!!!" and so, they'd run cars head on into other cars. but, then he got balls and shafted by a zombie with a broom stick i believe it was. the other part that kinda caught my attention was the part with the crash outside the building with the guys that they girl didn't want to come over... to what significant aspect of the movie did that give us? what was it? why was it there? why did the movie end with a guy breaking the tv's in a studio? i saw that there was a zombie running towards the screen, but he was kinda far away. i mean, he could have just turned the tv off. yes, this movie was shot on a whim and yes, i hated it. good day...

please, why on earth did bava had to add insult to injury making this pathetic piece of follow up crap?to begin with we, "the viewers" at home are treated to a narration from some unknown ding-bat informing us of the aftermath events of the previous episode indicating mankind's triumph over the demons, (yeah right).i can tell you "right now" that this doesn't in anyway what-so-ever have anything to do with demons as this is a completely new story with a different backdrop altogether. bava as usual, makes a casual appearance that doesn't even seem to fit into the main context of the story at all. acting in this one beyond appalling and the whole concept about the demons appearing through a tv set, oh god i'm not going to go on. go see for yourself.as usual you'll be treated to laughable dubbing, crap scenarios that don't make any sense and above all un-answered questions. how typical of a sequel that dished out the first batch of crap.overall if you're one of those dvd argentophile collector's, then maybe you'll wanna give this a go otherwise avoid like the plague, it's no way near the first, so you may wanna avoid like the plague.

when the word "presents" finds its way into a title, preceded by a famous name, the work is usually immediately dismissible. for some reason, people who are capable of creating good art don't seem to be able to see it in others. however, i've always been willing to give the second installment of the demons trilogy a try. for one thing, the soundtracks are absolutely to die for. most american directors would have sacrificed small animals to line up the kind of talent on the soundtrack of demons 2. for another, well, two words: asia argento. (of course, she was eleven when this film was made, and a number of years away from her seeming decision that she would style her acting after early helen mirren: steamy looks and little clothing.) as well, lamberto bava comes from one of italy's finest dynasties in that odd horror sub genre known as giallo (he's the son of mario bava, who may well have invented the genre in the sixties). and the original demons is an absolute must-see for fans of eighties b-horror films. so how bad can this be, right? well, bad. the demons continue their assault on italian media, as the movie opens in a modern italian high-rise where many people going about their lives have their televisions on in the background. they're all watching a kind of combination news report/mater video of some investigative reporter types trying to get proof of the events of the first film (which would seem to put the time frame of this one no more than a few days after the first film). through the usual horror-film extra inability to concentrate, the reporters manage to bring a demon back to life, and he comes through the tv screen to start the plague anew.yeah. it's that bad. about the only thing good one can say about the film is that the soundtrack (when you're not being buffeted about by the likes of the smiths, the cult, gene loves jezebel, etc.) is stunning. it comes from the keyboard of simon boswell, who got his start as a part of the argento dynasty and has since gone on to score such films as lord of illusions and hackers.makes a half-decent free rental if you're planning on drinking heavily, but it's certainly nowhere near the fun the original was. cronenberg's wonderfully funny high-rise-nasty-creature romp, shivers (aka they came from within), is a whole lot better.

everything that made the original so much fun seems to absent here. this is simply a "run of the mill demons on the loose wrecking havoc" slasher, but without the passion that graced the original.there's nothing new in the story, in fact it seems like they ignore the first one altogether. here, the demons run loose in a high security apartment building and, naturally, kill most of the residents in grisly fashion. the makeup effects actually seem less convincing here than the first time around. although the actors weren't exactly brilliant in demons, in demons 2 they're actually a lot worse. you don't care about these characters, at all. the plot is nonexistent, the music poor (apart from one simon boswell song), it's not scary in the least; it's just not that good.easily the worst film dario argento has been involved with and lamberto bava's also (bava has a cameo in this film, not a very funny one).maybe 3 is too high a rating, but at least i could watch it all and didn't think of stopping midway. my advice; stick to the original.

typically elaborately crafted hbo production with a first-rate cast, a rich small-town atmosphere and some nice narrative vignettes, graced by above average production values.but, and that's a huge 'but', the various subplots, peopled with some likable, mostly annoying caricatures, are paper-thin and go and and on in dull stretches for over three long hours.the often silly story veers uneasily between melodrama, without being entertaining enough, and personal drama, without being profound at all.a shame, because some scenes really shine. two or three, that is.4 out of 10 grubby paul newmans

despite the all-star cast, this attempt at epic fails. it comes across as a set of flat cartoon stereotypes strung together by an all too, too clever social commentary. it's as if with every bit of dialogue and introduction to a new character the writer peeks out and says "isn't that clever? am i not smart? isn't that biting social commentary?" and,sadly, the answer is always "ummmm...no." wearying self-absorbing stuff that is more like soap opera (in the worst sense of the term) than a movie...and an obvious attempt at television immortality. thankfully, it died young. empire falls falls flat.

wow. what can i say? i was born in 1960. i love bad tv movies. love them. i get involved. the works. i want to get involved. i'm spending time watching the thing. i watched the emmys last night on tv. how in the infinite world was the empire falls (excellent name)tv movie up for any awards? it truly had wonderful talent. of course. and they tried admirably. but how can anyone pretend that was an ok (tv for goodness sakes) screenplay? ok direction? you know, i wish everyone the best. really. but i thought it was totally mind-bending that hollywood was placing this very very bad film up for so many honors. awards? for me it was sort of a wake-up call that hollywood is such a small insular community. being cynical is not really my thing. but wow. --xptyngi

put simply, this mini-series was terrible. let me count the ways. 1. absurd plotting. 2. over-acting. 3. scattershot approach to characters. 4. annoying narration. 5. inability to create viewer interest.this film can't even pass the "soap opera for dummies" test. i'm sorry i have not read this award-winning novel, so i am judging it only as a film, but it really stinks. imagine going to a party where they show you dozens of appetizers. you look at the wide variety and want to taste them, but suddenly they are withdrawn, and you wonder where they went. that's like this film, with way too many characters introduced and never drawn out. there are enough stories and characters in this film to create a 20 episode series, yet we are given less than four hours to digest it all.there are more facial expressions and reaction shots of ed harris than you'll find on 10,000 monkeys. the pace is extraordinarily slow. dennis farina and helen hunt are so far over-the-top that their characters are not believable. joanne woodward's character is one-dimensional. the persistent river metaphor becomes trite.and, probably the most absurd part of the film--the cat. this evil and vengeful cat who follows the hero around to scratch him and his seat covers--well, come on now---it's not even good stephen king!probably the most interesting character in the film, and one who is not drawn well, is john voss, the disturbed boy whose final act of desperation accounts for the only plot device that works in this film.just about everyone in this film is unbelievable.to sum up, there's little here to inspire. the drama is poor melodrama. it's just a terrible effort.

i'm relieved the later reviews have turned sour - reading all the positive feedback, i was starting to worry that my understanding of movies (and life) was completely different than everyone else's in the world. everything in this movie rang false to me...the characters, the dialogue, the manipulative soundtrack, the corny narration, all of it. as each scene unfolded i kept thinking, "people don't act like this." it's relentlessly heavy-handed and maudlin. in a way i think the movie bullies you into liking it, or pretending to like it, because it's serious and about real people and confronts issues. but man, it really did not work for me.

we found this movie nearly impossible to watch. with such a super cast, it's a shame that the writing and direction were so awful. the excruciating pace at which the story was told was maddening. the flash-backs were clumsy. the characters were one-dimensional. the heavy-handed metaphors -- the river, the cat -- were repeated way too often. the movie nobody's fool, based on another novel by russo, was infinitely better, probably because it was more tightly written and directed. the photography in empire falls was lovely. too bad it wasn't a travelogue.i read the novel and enjoyed the writing style but had some quibbles with the novel itself. i would give the novel 4 out of 5 stars. perhaps the screenwriters and director were so awed by the novel's reputation they felt they had to include every darn thing in their movie. this was supposed to be a television movie, guys, not books on tape.

i know my summary sounds very harsh, but this film has very limited appeal. the average joe out there would have a hard time sticking with this film. the entire film consists of animated loggers doing their jobs and dancing on floating logs. this is all done with very splashy and artsy colors and the film might be great to show to patrons in an art museum. however, unless you really love this sort of art or are a canadian who loves films about your native land, then this is probably going to be next to impossible to finish. i have a rather high tolerance for this sort of thing and even i had to force myself to watch after a couple minutes. i can respect the work that went into it, but it's just not compelling.

not even emeril lagasse cooking can save this disjointed, overheaded idiotic nonsense, starring emeril lagasse as a tv chef from the food channel,who with help of the crew to try to make the show better, poor plot and stupid script throw this show down the drain, robert urich wasted in the poorly supporting role and sadly this was his last one ever(r.i.p.), this is the worst show of 2001 and it will be on the list of the worst shows of this decade.i feel very sorry for emeril lagasse for making this sitcom, he even said himself it stunk.it's hard to believe that they are the same producers of designing women that did this mess.tv review: 1 star

it's hard to make a negative statement here after all this raving about how great deed poll is, how wonderful the actors did and so on and so on. i did not like the film. it's crappy!there are orgies, they have taboo sex (gay sex, bi sex, oral sex, rape, anal sex, masturbation, brother-sister-sex, brother-brother-sex, sex on drugs, sex without drugs, sex, sex, sex seems to rule their world. i guess the director is desperately in need of a getting laid.) the story is just dirty and shameful. i wonder what made those people get up with this story. and above all: who cares?the technical stuff didn't satisfy me as well. the sound is poor, so is the editing and the "direction" is absent. the actors are admittedly fine, but guess what! it's their job! their job is to act! no need to jump off your seats if an actor did a decent job. do you applause when a bus driver brings you home safely? see?i gave it 2/10 because after all this thing had something that i can't put in words. b movie charm? camp fun? nudity? i don't know.

i watched this movie a couple of weeks ago and must say: i was not impressed, not at all. i do side with the other posters when it comes to the fine performances, but some good performances do not make a good movie.on the discussion board, i found a review by an anonymous poster that captured some of the main points. it says: "'deed poll' is a movie that raises many questions but hardly answers even a few; a movie that is disturbing and above every attempt at categorizing; an experiment and a very conventional sexual drama despite some shocking scenes. the brilliant acting of barbara kowa and andré schneider, the partly very impressive editing and the good camera work (steffen ritter) make up for gross plot holes and some technical slips (especially in sound). however, the boredom the audiences have to deal with for 40 minutes remains." unfortunately, this is true. i wasn't intrigued by the story at all. the protagonists are cold, ambition-less people. they do a lot of drugs and have a lot of (incestuous) sex. so what? for many times, the direction seemed to be virtually non-existent, not to mention the technical aspect: the poor sound quality was enormously disturbing.what's the point of the movie? what's the message behind it all? the anonymous reviewer said: "somehow biermann failed to make a clear point and so the movie remains hanging in mid-air without a message. thus the boredom i blame on the movie. the movie is reserved and emotionless, cold, almost neutral and it doesn't take long to see the flaws: for long stretches the characters of sean and ivy are not credible (they clearly have difficulties with the english pronunciation), the character of the mute brother is not developed very well. some moments are very promising though - in the scene where the call boy is skinned (the one and only true love scene) an intensity is reached that one would love to see the whole movie long. as a spectator one has to regret the chances given away." again, i must agree. i did like the final scene, especially because of the beautifully captured faces of gianni meurer and andré schneider, but it was nothing compared to the boredom i had to suffer for the first thirty minutes. (the sex scenes, though, were aesthetically staged and perfectly edited.)all in all, "deed poll" was not my cup of tea - a good, controversial idea wasted -, but it was a interesting to see how a movie can be made with practically no money. maybe if they had a bigger budget and a more experienced director, this would have become a better movie.

"electra glide in blue" is a slow moving b-flick in which blake plays a desert motorcycle cop who wants to be a homicide detective and becomes embroiled in a murder investigation. a mediocre film at best, "eg in b" features some members of the band chicago, a whiff of action, some philosophizing, and lots and lots of boring dramatic filler. not worth the time.

i always wanted to see electra glide in blue for a very long time. i've always been intrigued by the title, the star and the desert but for some (now pretty clear) reason, this film is never shown on tv or i've happen to miss it if it's ever shown. well, after watching the dvd, i now know why the movie is rarely shown: it's because it's not that good. in fact, i'd say it's pretty much of a mess.electra glide in blue was made by a first time director and it shows. the film is mainly a series of vignettes with absolutely nothing holding it together. more like a collection of short movies haphazardly strung together. the movie can be boiled down to this: intro (murder); cop and girlfriend together; intro credits; cops going to work; crazy guy tells story; cop finds dead body; cop and chief and girlfriend at bar; chase scene; etc. the scenes just don't flow together. they're very distinctively independent from each other and because of this the characterization is weak, borderline amateurish. the scene at the bar with the girlfriend, the scene at the farm with the hippies, the scene with big john and the chief yelling at each other were cringe worthy. i almost stopped the film during those (awful) moments.the film-maker's lack of experience is in evidence throughout the film. the style, like the 1970s, is all over the map. the intro credit scene makes the movie look like a commercial for law enforcement. then it tries to be a buddy film (big john and zipper) then a murder mystery; then a melodramatic love story; etc. a film doesn't have to have one particular style in order to be successful but i'm afraid the style in electra glide in blue was confused. you can clearly see that the director had no idea what he was doing or where he was going with it.the film is not a complete disaster. while the content of electra glide in blue is almost amateurish, the look of it is extremely (and deceptively) professional. the cinematography is stunning. every frame is worthy of an exhibition at an art gallery. or, because the first (and last) time director was involved in the music business, worthy of an album cover. the beautiful look of the film gives more credence to the finish product than it really deserves. and thanks to robert blake's acting (of a really badly written character), the film maintains a certain level of realism, even though nothing else makes much sense. what's remarkable about the look and composition of the film is that it's been copied and duplicated a million times over. the intro credits reminded me of something like top gun, which was made 13 years later. scenes of johnny dressing up, with his clothes on the bed, reminded me of american gigolo. strangely enough, electra glide in blue has a very contemporary feel to it, due to the stunning visuals, even if the story and the philosophy behind it are hopelessly outdated.so, electra glide in blue is, on one hand, a remarkably underrated and overlooked film because it obviously influenced a lot of future filmmakers out there when it comes to the look and composition. very few films can claim to have achieved this and legendary cinematographer conrad hall should take full credit. but, on the other hand, egib is also deservedly forgotten because the poor characters, confusing story, and muddled direction, none of which are worth of remembering.

first off, i am a huge fan of robert blake, always have been.this movie came on movieplex last night 10/13, and the title interested me & of course the star. but after watching it i was left more confused than i was before it started.... there are some good scenes, and i thought they would lead somewhere, but they didn't, it turned out to be an "anti-cop" "anti-buddy" "anti-hippie", pretty much "anti-everything movie", with an extremely confusing plot that also went nowhere.robert blake is great as the lead, well as great as someone could be with this bad movie, i am still a huge fan of mr. blake and love his acting even in crap like this...but this drug induced 70's tripe, well... better stay away from this one...and, that ending, what a pisser.

the show is at least partially faked (so is not reality, just pretending to be reality), which makes me believe at least anyone without face blurred out is a fake episode.proof in the episode where he pretends to be stabbed there is already camera crew on the boat, before he gets there, can been seen as his boat approaches.the actors playing "ambulance officers" didn't remove his shirt or expose the wound in anyway so they work on it, which would never happen in reality.they also parked the ambulance in the car park and did not drive up to the emergency entrance (which does not make any sense, unless its fake and they would not be allowed to go there)

i think cheaters needs to be off the air and end the reality show once and for all i don't care what anyone says you can attack me or agree with me but its times like this that the show is just spewing out propaganda and the host of cheaters joey greco is a little bastard who wants to think that showing people on camera is effective and unawares no it just will show disgusting he is also the wiretapping and following of people by "cheaters spy's" is illegal and a federal offense we are living in a police state like the soviet union and nazi germany rolled into one i am happy that there is poor reviews on this trash this needs to end soon or we are going to lose our liberties as a nation no wonder our country is going to hell its because of this and other filth shows i liked the older shows better from the 1950s-1980s i hope you all agree with me on that thank you infowarrior

i'm not bothered by the sleazy hosts, nor am i bothered by the cynical, self-righteous stance the makers of this crap take.what i am bothered about is that the vast majority of the episodes are fake. i wouldn't even be surprised if all of the episodes were staged. hence this isn't a reality show but something far worse even than oprah: garbage television with zero comma zero appeal. like daily tv soap opera but with more action and fighting and less plot.the premise would have turned out great - if only it had been executed without cheating the viewer. if only this idea were free of all the legal complications/trappings that would most certainly ensue due to what would happen with real people, and what is eventually aired. hence the only way to create this """reality show""" was to get some rather desperate actors and make them improvise (and what pitiful and unconvincing improvisation it is most of the time!). shouldn't this be obvious to anyone who finished grade school? most reviews i read here don't even mention that any of this is fake, let alone that all of it might be. wishful thinking or just boundless naivety? the actors hired in this pathetic show are the kind of bottom-of-the-barrel unemployed actors who are miserably waiting on tables, waiting eagerly for a call from a talk show (or this crap), which is when they finally get a chance to make several hundred bucks. i even recognized one actress (in the role of "cheater") that i saw years earlier in "the jerry springer show". and i only saw 6-7 episodes of "cheaters". how many more of these loser actors are there that appeared in springer and "cheaters" that i don't even know about?however, to compare "cheaters" with springer isn't fair to the latter. the springer show is not all fake; a bulk of the episodes are unstaged - hence often highly entertaining. there is no value to be found in "cheaters", unless you're a struggling actor and want to get tips on how not to act in front of the camera.the producers use various (very cheap, transparent) tricks to create the illusion of realness, to give their footage that elusive documentary feel. but it's all in vein. in the end, the more intelligent train-wreck-seeking viewer is left with absolutely squat. "professional wrestling" has more credibility than this.

there is a growing trend in the media to vilify and ridicule men. one sees it in television adverts and program plots. cheaters is a prime example, they could find plenty of female cheaters yet the vast majority shown are men, why? the prime threat to any government's power resides in the male population, they're less likely to abide by authority and are more of a physical combat threat. a way to reduce the threat is to emasculate men in society via the media. other examples of psychological propaganda are crime dramas full of self righteous cops including big-jawed aggressive women accusing everyone they question trampling their rights and making those men feel like scum. in australia many top male sports stars have been arrested recently for dubious assaults and drinking charges, another example of the government controlling the male populous by arresting their heroes and asserting dominance. cheaters, aside from the political machinations is an invasion of privacy and a violation of rights, furthermore most of these women assault the men! if it were round the other way the men would be in jail!! if it were an honest show they would be finding women cheaters, because they don't normally get caught due to the fact that their male lovers are quite happy to get in no strings attached and get out without rocking the boat. men's mistresses want the men to themselves and want to own and control the men and thus get the men caught anyway.

too bad this movie isn't. while "nemesis game" is mildly entertaining, i found it hard to suspend my disbelief the whole length of the movie, especially the situations that sara was putting herself into. are we supposed to believe that:1) this hot chick is going to go slumming unarmed around abandoned buildings and dark subway tunnels in the middle of the night just to solve some riddles?2) the protagonists are supposedly such experts that they play riddle games for fun, but don't put the whole "i never sinned" riddle together until the very end...and then...and then...get this...she has to do the whole mirror thing to finally put the pieces together?? i know it was the filmmaker's device to show the audience what was going on, but do they really think we're that stupid?3) when vern and sara go to the chez m to question the blonde, there is not one topless chick in the whole building. nada. c'mon. i know it's canada, but i would expect more from a country that gave us shannon tweed.and anyone else notice that when vern was surfing the web and found that riddlezone site, that when he moused over the link the cursor stayed an arrow, and didn't turn into a little hand (like all cursors do when you click on a hyperlink)?!? i mean, if you're gonna have the internet play such a prominent role in your movie, at least get the little things right. geez.

this movie had a very unique effect on me: it stalled my realization that this movie really sucks! it is disguised as a "thinker's film" in the likes of memento and other jewels like that, but at the end, and even after a few minutes, you come to realize that this is nothing but utter pretentious cr4p. probably written by some collage student with friends to compassionate to tell him that his writing sucks. the whole idea is  i don't even know if it tried to scratch on the supernatural, or they want us to believe that because someone fills your mind (a very weak one, btw) with stupid "riddles", the kind you learn on elementary school recess, you suddenly come to the "one truth" about everything, then you have to kill someone and confess. !!! what? how, what, why, why? is just like saying that to make a cake, just throw a bunch of ingredients, and add water forgot about cooking it? i guess these guys forgot to, not explain, but present the mechanism of why was this happening? you have to do that when you present a story which normal, everyday acts (lie solving riddle rhymes) start to have an abnormal effect on people. acting was horrible, with that girl always trying to look cute at the camera, and the guy from highlanders, the series, acting up like the though heavy metal record store (yeah, they're all real though s-o-b's). the "menacing" atmosphere, with the "oh-so-clever" riddles (enter the 60's series of batman and robin, with guest appearance of the riddle) and the crazies who claim to have "the knowledge" behind that smirk on their faces just horrible, horrible.i'm usually very partial about low budget movies, and tend to root for the underdog by giving them more praise than they may deserve, in lieu of their constrictions, you know, but this is just an ugly excuse for a movie that will keep you wanting to be good for an hour and a half, and at the end you will just lament that you fell for it.

well i'd probably agree with all the bad comments about this movie cos honestly i thought it was such a piece of crap i mean the actors had done a terrible acting job and the script was all terrible. although the special effects wasn't a bit bad but i think the should have thought a lot harder than that. i mean how did clara bryant get successfully put into this film i mean she'd do a lot better if she looked a bit further and that goes the same with kristen honey, i mean her character dies and she doesn't bother to try and defend herself i mean it's gotta be a total joke. she should at least do a lot better than what she an do like become a soldier or more of a heroine or something along the lines of bravery. but the point is the actors did a complete soulless lousy job and so did the director and the writer who made this film. they should've went into film school to think up some better ideas and i hope everyone agrees with my methods cos they are probably thinking the same thing.

the forgotten (aka: don't look in the basement) is a very cheaply made and very old looking horror movie.the story is very slow and never really reaches anything worth getting excited about.the patients at the asylum are embarrassingly funny especially sam and the old woman who always quotes an old saying to everyone. (look out for the bit when she gets close to the camera, tell me you can watch without laughing!).now the gore is very poor looking, with the blood looking pink in many scenes so it doesn't really deserve its place on the video nasties list!.overall if you aren't looking for a fantastic horror film and have some time to spare then it's worth a watch.

it's not unusual that hollywood likes to pump out crappy films. occasionally, a handful of good films come out of them while the majority just sucks major ass. it's also not surprising that those bad films are retreads of old tv series'. occasionally a surprise pops up with "the fugitive" (who saw that best picture oscar nom coming?), but for every "fugitive", there's a mchale's navy or some other wholly unoriginal film devoid of any plot or interest. the mod squad, in my opinion, goes into my top ten of truly lousy films, in which hollywood should get it's sorry ass beaten for producing what could've been a good movie. we're shifted right dab smack in the middle of a story that just doesn't seem to make sense, it wastes the talent, and the dialogue is just bad. we don't actually know who the hell these characters are, and we could give a flying f**k about what they are. instead, you're expected to automatically know who they are and what they're going to do. there's one particularly bad riff, about the "i'm too old for this s**t" line, that's just plain stupid. something my friend verbally noted when we were clamoring for the movie to just end. it's just an insult to hollywood cinema. grade: f-

i expected this movie to be absolutely god awful. like "what dreams may come" or "the truman show" or something. well they were selling it off for £3.99 in my local hmv and it had giovanni ribisi on the cover, you know you cant help but love him, and so my friends dared me to buy it. and i was sure it was going to be trash. maybe thats the only reason i could sit through this movie, because my standards were never that high.

one day someone said lets redo the mod squad we can make it hip cool and all that yo!it'll make a mint then they actually made it and as you are watching it you can hear your spleen cringe in agony as it twists and binds into a knot from the pure horror of it all any movie ever made has something on this id rather meet wayne newton and sing karaoke with him in a gay bar in idaho and drink a virgin bloody mary than ever watch this again may god have mercy on my soul

dr stephens (micheal harvey) runs a mental asylum. he has a different approach to the insane. he conducts unorthodox methods of treatment. he treats everyone like family, there are no locks on the patients doors and he lets some of the inmates act out their twisted fantasies. he lets sergeant jaffee (hugh feagin) dress and act as a soldier and harriet (camilla carr) be a mother to a doll, including letting her put it to bed in a cot. dr. stevens is outside letting judge oliver w. cameron (gene ross) chop a log up with an axe, it turns out to be a bad move as once dr. stevens back is turned the judge plants the axe in his shoulder. soon after nurse charlotte beale (rosie holotik) arrives at the sanitarium having arranged an interview with dr. stevens about a possible job. she is met by the head nurse, geraldine masters (annabelle weenick as anne mcadams) and is offered a trail position. she gets to know and becomes well liked among the patients. however things eventually start to turn sour, the phone lines are cut, an old lady named mrs. callingham (rhea macadams) has her tongue cut out and she starts to get a strange feeling that things just aren't right somehow. then, one night all the sanitariums dark secrets are violently revealed. produced and directed by s.f. brownrigg this film has a great central idea which builds into a cool twist ending, but ultimately is a bit of a chore to sit through because of it's low budget restrictions and a rather slow script by tim pope. there are just too many long boring stretches of dialogue by the inmates, not a lot really happens until the final twenty odd minutes. the film has no real visual quality as it's set entirely in the sanitarium and it's grounds which is basically just a big bland house in the middle of nowhere. there's no graphic gore in it, a few splashes of blood here and there and thats yer lot. there's a bit of nudity, but like the gore not much. the acting is pretty strong, especially holotik and weenick. the photography is flat and unexciting and i can't even remember what the music was like. the twist ending is great, but it just takes far too long to get to it. a film that had a lot of potential that was probably held back by it's budget. ok i guess, but i think it would have worked a lot better if the story had been turned into a half an hour 'tales form the crypt' episode.

i'm not one of those folks who bemoans everytime a film based on an old tv show comes out. rather, i usually run out and see it (if i had watched the show) and try to get nostalgic. but if anyone feels like running down films based on old shows, this is exhibit a (so you can actually say something more than just "mchale's navy"). "mod squad" is dreary, tiring, and lethargic. at least the original series was angst riddled long before anyone knew teens could be so glum, making it groundbreaking. this is just tedious. claire danes is nice to look at, but does nothing else but mood swing and sneak around spying on the baddies. giovanni ribisi's acting extent in this flick is that droopy the dog look for an hour and forty five minutes. and omar epps looks like he wants to flee the set, but the script's chlostraphobia has trapped him. sure, the production is nice, with the now seemingly obligitory "rave" nightclub opening action sequence and shootouts galore. oh, and the kids yell and get mad at each other and their superiors a lot too. it's kind of like deciding to use the scooby doo mystery machine to go on a family vacation to hollywood with your teenage kids who you and your spouse know need heavy therapy and prescription drugs. i really wanted to like this movie, and there were promising moments, but the next scene would suck the life out of it. you can knock another spelling remake, "charlie's angels", all you want, but at least that film knew it wanted to have fun with itself. "the mod squad" makes you wonder where the inspiration from the original series went.

young writers, young auteur, young cast, busload of producers, what could go wrong? everything. even lame is too good a description, that suggests that three of four legs were functioning, when actually, none of them were. barely enough recycled plotline for a 48 and a half minute television hour, gratingly stretched to ninety minutes. the audience was talking back to the screen, so bad was the story. dirty cops steal drugs from the evidence locker. how many thousands of times has this been done on television? bad cops frame good cops. again, how many times? there was not an original shred in this entire concoction. giovanni ribisi made a valiant effort to prop up the lack of script, drawing the only laughs of the entire movie. and the thought of he and claire danes working from a real script with a grown-up director and photographed by an actual cinematographer intrigues me. note to screenwriters: buy one of those story generators. it can't possibly be as bad as ripping off bad television. note to auteur: there are shots available to you other than closeups. even the lovely and interesting face of claire danes eventually grows tiresome in closeup. note to cinematographer: apprentice yourself to a professional for a few years--you have much to learn. note to color timer at the lab: at least try to persuade the auteur and the cinematographer that they don't know what they're talking about. note to claire: i hope this paid for your new condo. it's time to get some professional management and start actually reading the scripts before signing on.

i love these awful 80's summer camp movies. the best part about "party camp" is the fact that it literally has no plot. it simply drops a weak batch of "characters" into a location and then things occasionally happen. the cliches here are limitless (spoilers): the nerds vs. the jocks, the secret camera in the girls locker room, the hikers happening upon a nudist colony, the contest at the conclusion, the secretly horny camp administrators, and the embarrassingly foolish sexual innuendo littered throughout. the only cliche missing is the presence of corey feldman. this movie will make you laugh, but never intentionally. i repeat, never. a final note, be prepared to bust a gut watching the nonsense that is the "dramatic" scene where jerry riviera and d.a. share a beer late at night, spilling their guts to each other. the dialogue literally makes no sense, and the acting belongs on a high-school stage. it's a classic.

there are movies that are leaders, and movies that are followers."meatballs" was a leader. and here's one of its followers."party camp" is about as interchangeable as any of its brethern who plumbed the depths that "meatballs" (the original) had so successfully mined. of course, that one had bill murray. so, what does "party camp" have?i'm glad you asked that question.jewel sheperd has made these flicks her bread and butter, and what a side dish she provides! even as an innocent (wink, wink) girlfriend to a rich twerp (cribb), she provides that sultry steam she gives to all her parts. and yes, guys, she shows (if you know what i mean and i think you do). my gosh, that smile of hers could melt through titanium.what? oh yeah, the movie. nothing special as i said; every cheap joke is aimed for and hit (at about crotch-level). and eternal teen jayne is good for a laugh or two. but instead of a sense of humor there's just nudity, lame sex jokes, more, nudity, a soft-core dream sequence, a sex symbol nurse simply for (clothed!) leering purposes, even more nudity....hmmm... maybe it's a good idea bill murray wasn't in this.two stars. for jewel, naturally. plenty of "camp", but not much of a "party".

the worst movie i've seen in years (and i've seen a lot of movies). acting is terrible, there is no plot whatsoever, there is no point whatsoever, i felt robbed after i rented this movie. they recommended it to me mind you! a disgrace for terrible movies! stay away from this terrible piece of c**p. save your money !

i watched this movie which i really thought had a promising beginning but then it just led me to feel disappointed in the end. the problem i think with this film was that the director was trying a bit to hard to make this film weird and original. there were too many flashbacks and too many bad "effects" which got me annoyed through the film. i love debbie harry and isaac hayes but they disappointed me in this film, they could of done much better. this film seemed promising in the beginning, dragging in the middle and then disappointing in the end. the film could never beat stanley kubrick's geniousness when it comes to controversial matters, weirdness and originality in movies.

i picked this movie up because it sounded like a pretty decent flick, and i've always been a fan of foreign films. however, for someone who likes movies, i was surprised at how much i hate, hate, hated this movie.although it does aim to expose the lives of young, lowerclass men in lima, and to an extent it does succeeed, the characters are hopelessly shallow and the audience winds up having absolutely no feelings whatsoever for them.although the story chiefly revolves around m, he rarely ever speaks, and his dialouge is, at best, amazingly dry and dull.*** warning: some small spoilers ***basically, the story revolves around a young man named m who has been searching for jobs, but without success (he does gain employment twice, but quits because they're "not for him", when you're poor, the last option you have is to be picky). some amount of time is spent with his friends, who's idea of "fun" is to rape a little 14 year old, steal crappy tires off a piece of shit car for a dime sack of weed, and several other slightly retarded activities.m's friend comesup with a plan to make $25,000 a piece and move to the us by running cocaine to miami. when the drug lord gives them a job, we're treated to an extremely lame scene of the three friends buying clothes at the mall with some music playing in the background. we see them trying different clothes on like little girls given $200 to shop, get there hair cut, and then strutting off looking like slick gangsters (one character, carlos, will from this point on wear sunglasses always... even at night).the day before they leave, the leader of the group leaves to speak with the drug lord, leaving m and his friend to be dumb. they party up, take several samples of the drugs they're suppose to run, and break into thier old school, acting like animals and smashing everything in sight.the movie ends when m tries calling his girlfriend, who hangs up on him. the friends then proceed to set the pay phone on fire, which brings out a bunch of kids and some old man with gun. m and carlos' friend in charge of the drug run shows up on his motorcycle and wants them to leave with him now. then he takes off by himself, and gets shot by that old man. the police show up and arrest m and his friends (but not the man who shot the guy) and cover thier dead friend up with newspapers as music plays and it fades to credits.**** end spoiler ****i even watched this movie a second time, hoping to see some subtle, redeeming factor for it, but i did not. a complete waste of 102 minutes. although i must give it credit for being straightforward and not shying away from disturbing elements, the casting, acting, and overall direction still leaves much, much, much to be desired.imho, if you're interested in a movie that explores the issues this one was suppose to, go rent city of god (cidade de deus) instead. avoid this trash at all costs! you have been warned!!

now this is a bad movie if i've ever seen one. in one of film's greatest years, 1999, detroit rock city contends with runaway bride and wild wild west for the bottom spot in a barrel of junkies. the plot is masterful. four scrawny high school youngsters finally have their chance at seeing the hard rock theatrics of kiss forthe third year in a row. so when their tickets are toiled by an ultra-religious, chain-smoking mom, the pals scramble themselves in getting to detroit, and i'm sure you can figure out the rest.well, not exactly; the movie does go to extreme measures in explaining how the four band members (no, not gene, paul, ace and peter) go about getting these tickets: losing your virginity in a confessional; saving a smoked-out bimbo and your mom's volvo (from the soprano's steve schirripa, nonetheless); preventing a robbery in the midst of botching one for a 12-year-old's debt; and of course, stripping down to your bare essentials for mc ron jeremy after shuttling a full blender with bourbon-leftovers. sounds funny, doesn't it? perhaps detroit rock city does have a point with all this tomfoolery in how extreme sometimes these fans can go. and we do understand this movie is a comedy; it is supposed to be filled with slapstick. but does detroit rock city aim to the proper audience? it is rated r, meaning the only way prepubescent adolescents-the audience as i see it, to which many will eventually hail this one a classic-will voyeur is through illegal terms.detroit rock city also fails at giving itself the late-1970's touch. the camera's texture quality is way too clear and way too bright, missing the necessary flair from films like this is spinal tap and sid & nancy. this would've allowed audiences to feel `more at home' with the times. simply costuming kids into pre-90's grunge-wear and settling others into `disco infernos' does not do the trick. environment does mean something you know; i doubt detroit looked this glamorous in '78. if there's anything positive coming from this movie it's the kick-ass soundtrack of hard late-70 to early-80's rock. van halen, ac/dc, you name it, it's all here. of course we can't forget kiss, the band aptly subjected throughout.what the film noticeably fails to manage are questions concerning why the knights of satin's service (it's really just kiss) were so frowned upon by moms around the nation. sure, the loud rock and devilish makeup might be a part of that; encouragements for youth to explore themselves and have a good time might be fair reasons as well. but, what is kiss saying in the music we hear throughout the film towards this highly rebellious group? what separates these anthems of `rock[ing] and roll[ing] all night and partying everyday' from the rest of the music? most likely, these questions will remain in a music communication class and not in the films that should answer them, simply because it is kiss and they rock and we must do everything in our god-forgiven power to see them.1.5/5 stars

this fourth installment of the series is the last to get a theatrical release,though it feels like a direct to video movie.it's ok,i guess,but nothing special.the acting is the worst of seen in the series up to this point.and like the third movie,there isn't much in the way of imagination.also,the sentence "directed by alan smithee" is never a good thing.smithee is the pseudonym directors use when they want nothing to do with the movie.anyway,its an acceptable movie in the hellraiser series,but not much more than that.it's a slight drop in quality from number three,and a huge drop from the first two.for me,hellraiser iv:bloodline is a 4.5/10

***spoilers!*** i sometimes wonder what makes sequel-makers think that they have to explain (and therefore destroy) the mysteries behind iconic horror films. the original "hellraiser" of 1987 was an absolute masterpiece and probably one of the scariest films ever made. the 1988 sequel "hellbound" was also a fantastic horror film, though i personally didn't like how the viewer got background information on the cenobites, some of the all-time creepiest horror-villains in the original. the third part, "hell on earth" (1992) was already quite a mess, whose makers obviously thought it necessary to add a dose of humor to the formerly incomparably creepy lead-cenobite pinhead (a typical 90s stupidity) and therefore destroyed most of his scariness. this fourth part "hellraiser: bloodline" (1996) is slightly more atmospheric than the third one, but it lowers this quality by inventing even more silly and completely unnecessary 'background information' about the cenobites and the opening of the gates to hell.seriously - did we need to know how the mysterious puzzle boxes that open the gates to hell are being made? i think not, and that is not the only mystery about the cenobites that is stupidly destroyed in this film. the setting of "bloodline" goes back and forth in three different periods. the film begins in a 22nd century space-station, when scientist dr. merchant (bruce ramsay) attempts to close the gates to hell forever. when government soldiers disrupt his mission he has to explain his reasons. in 18th century paris, merchant's ancestor was a toymaker assigned to build a puzzle box by an aristocrat obsessed with the occult. an evoked demon, the princess of hell, took over the body of the beautiful angelique (valentina vargas). since the only person capable of destroying the gateway to hell is the one who built it, the bloodline of the toymaker would be cursed and his ancestors infested by cenobites throughout the ages... the film, which takes place in the 18th century, the present, and the 22nd century, really is quite a mess. i admit that the part set in the 18th century has a creepy atmosphere and is by far the best part of the film, but its also its smallest part. the parts set in the present and in the future are quite weak, and filled with stupid and unworthy elements. the film's undoubtedly strong points are the terrific make-up and gore-effects, the absolutely ravishing valentina varagas as the she-demon, and pinhead (doug bradley), who, in spite of having lost some of his creepiness, still is a menacing villain. it is an almost offensive idea for "hellraiser" fans, however, that pinhead is supposed be defeated by a ridiculous light-show. overall, "bloodline" is not a complete disaster, but it sure is an unworthy sequel to a series that began so brilliantly. even director kevin yagher was obviously embarrassed about it, as he preferred to be credited as alan smithee. overall, this is only recommendable to hardcore pinhead-fanatics, and most of them are probably going to be angered by another diminution of their favorite demon's creepiness. all others are well-advised to stick with the brilliant first, and excellent second part of the "hellraiser" franchise and skip all the others. the makeup effects in "bloodline" are creepy as hell, but almost everything else is disappointing. my rating: 3.5/10

it's true, no one really expects anything from sequels. but even by that low standard this is a terrible film.essentially an anthology movie, this fourth installment in the hellraiser saga tries to be an origins story and a wind-up to the entire series at the same time. an ambitious idea. but none of the cast is given enough screen time to do anything with their characters and rookie director yagher abandoned the film rather than give in to studio meddling. the result is a steaming pile of mediocrity that even fanboys have trouble defending. unless you're an "alan smithee" fan, avoid this one.

hellraiser: bloodline is where the sequel mediocrity of the hellraiser series well and truly sets in. gone is the imagination and invention of the first two movies. gone is the ethos of pinhead and his minions. gone are the sick desires of humans. in fact everything that once made hellraiser so original has been trashed by this mess of a picture.all that is left is that basic premise of christian mythology that there is a hell with evil demons. what happened to the evil that men do? this watered down excuse for a hellraiser movie is padded out with endless psycho babble, so that pinhead becomes a nonsense spouting philosopher and not the harbinger of doom as he is meant to be. the film uses the most basic of film formulas with characters separating and getting individually killed. pinhead is not alien. the link between the box and the 'demons' or 'hell' is never established it just arrives at a sacrifice and sits on a sideboard.the lead female character is called 'rimmer' and the producers obviously think it really funny because everyone keep saying her name. really the film should have been retitled to give it that characters name.shame on you kevin yagher and alan smithee.

the animal-eating (geek) scenes were not as bad as you would think. after having watched mondo cane and mondo magic, these scenes are average. the grossest one was when the guy ate the head off the mouse. but they were so fast and few that they didn't bother me.otherwise, the film was just sort of interesting. i always like hearing the silly voice-overs. they never sound like what you think the actor/actress would sound like in real life. i liked the bright colors worn by the princesses. the shots of weird looking bugs were cool too. the youngest princess looked really young, almost 14 or something. the fight scenes were not as long and boring as most fight scenes, so that was good.3/10.

if, like me, you actively seek out the rarest and weirdest (and often most awful) that world cinema has to offer, then you should look no further than the supernatural horror output of hong kong in the early 80s. often mixing bizarre black magic with kung fu and silly comedy, and usually packed with plenty of creepy crawlies (snakes, worms, eels, centipedes etc.), these movies are about as bizarre as it gets.succubare is definitely a case in point: featuring a mountain tribe whose women keep their men from straying by casting nasty spells over them (that, should they leave, cause them to fill up with writhing creatures and die an agonising death), some so-so martial arts, and lots of real life animal killing (much of which is perpetrated by a geek who has absolutely no bearing on the story), this film is just plain strange.a prolonged scene in which the tribeswomen hunt for snakes and insects, casually throwing the creatures into the baskets on their backs, is quite fascinating; a tribal feast that sees a poor ox bashed on the head and then torn apart is totally disgusting; and the moments that show worms crawling in open wounds and being vomited onto the floor will have the squeamish losing their appetite for a while.however, it's the live animal munching that really qualifies succubare for legendary status amongst fans of out-there movie-making. it's thoroughly vile to watch and yet strangely compelling: the geek chomps on a snake, woofs down a fat, juicy toad (nasty!), and hungrily devours a mouse (biting off its head and then shoving the rest in afterwards).not a great movie (hell, it's not really even a mediocre movie), succubare is recommended only to people who think they've seen it all. this one gets 4 out of 10 from me, which is probably more than it deserves, but i begrudgingly respect it for being able to make me feel slightly ill.

i have never ever seen such a bad movie before. the scene where they shoot some guy.. the pistol don`t even shoot. damn that is baad. the scene with the boy is even not that good. no script, not any good sound, not anything good to say about this movie..

given the budget and the inexperience of everyone involved, livin' tha life could have been worse. jamal wants to be chris tucker (whom i've always found very annoying), as a previous commentator has noted, but peanut (edward d. smith), while some of his (over)reactions go on way too long (a director's problem), has some comparatively subtle and funny moments, such as when he is trying to instruct jamal on the proper method of smoking a joint with a buddy. throughout, he is usually more poised and self-possessed than jamal, which could have been the germ of a nice exploration of the contrasts in the relationship but wasn't developed very far.but the inexperience of the writer/director/cinematographer/etc. is no excuse for his inattention. has he ever seen a movie? faces are important! has he ever heard of a closeup? even ed wood could do a closeup. i don't think it's much of a budget issue. i could only give a general description of what any of the actors look like, and not just because of no closeups, but the lighting ...! lights for outdoor shooting may cost too much, but you can make a reflector with pieces of paper! that would have required moving the camera closer to keep the reflector out of the shot, helping to solve the closeup problem at the same time. if that's too technical you can turn the actors around so they are not in shadow, or you can expose for the shadows, and if it hadn't been shot in l.a. i'd say take advantage of cloudy days. it goes without saying that the movies this one steals from are all, with the possible exception of weekend at bernie's, better than this one, but livin' tha life would have left a much better impression if it hadn't made the viewer squint all the way through just to catch a glimpse of whatever the human element might have been.p.s. the scene in the barbershop is just stupid.

my friends and i watched this movie last night. it was pretty incredible. by all means, this was probably the worst movie i have ever seen. at first, it was tolerable. it stunk of bad improv but it was pretty friggin hilarious, despite the scenes being too long & drawn out and the terrible quality (i read $400 budget above... sounds about right) of the film itself.the biggest problem came from the lack of a script; with a background in improv, i know how hard it can be to keep scenes short & efficient. what happened in this film was that the actors were left to improvise the scenes and they didn't know when to stop, they just kept going for ages on stupid topics. at first i thought this was because the movie was short and they needed long, useless scenes to flesh it out. as the movie progressed, i realized it was just a really bad movie.there were a lot of parts where i could see that the film maker had a really good idea for a shot but not the resources (or talent!?) to pull it off effectively. a lot of the scenes were taken from a single shot (cause, you know, improv) for what felt like a really long time. so boring! if you can stand to put up with and hour and a half of terrible improv, watch it. it's really funny at parts but also really stupid and annoying. the acting ranges from alright to absolutely terrible. it seemed like the only good parts were the parts that really had nothing to do with the main plot; the ballsy kid who swore lots, the barbershop, etc etc.but yeah. painfully bad. like, i was literally hurting. after an hour or so, my friends and i just got bored and left.

never before have i seen such a tale of such talentless hangers on been so ungrateful that their golden goose has failed to lay. these spunk monkeys are parasites and bad examples of friends. i felt sorry for troy as he tried to hook up all of his friends with hollywood gigs, but as soon as things turned sour, they all left troy hanging. overnight was a contrived effort of self indulgent retribution on a man who was going up against the forces of hollywood to retain story integrity. the simple premise of overnight is to try an communicate the message, "look at this guy, he blew it all", when in fact he has a strong underground following, dealt with harsh blows from friends and executives all in the name of getting a project done in the way he envisioned it. quite frankly the only productive par that any of these guys played in the overall execution of the boondock saints shoot culminated as nothing more than extra bodies in the first bar room scene, after that all they did was whine why they weren't a bigger deal based on the clambering of their rancid efforts on top of troys shoulders. (the 2nd half of this was written by adam j farina)

i was so looking forward to watching the documentary self-immolation of the mastermind behind boondock saints, one of the most aggravating and pointless movies i've ever seen. but the makers of "overnight" - buddies (ex?) of the mastermind in question - also need to learn how to make a movie. various unsavoury remarks, yelling obscenities into the phone, and enjoying his alcohol do indeed make mr. duffy look like a putz. but it doesn't shed any insight into why the guy got a contract in the first place, what his creative process or vision is - what's boondock saints even about? how hard is it to meet patrick swayze? what are these strange institutional machinations in which our disgusting heroes are caught? because the film doesn't try to answer these questions in any coherent way, it doesn't end up having dippity-doo to say about hollywood either. so who cares?

odious chuck norris decided to put one final nail in the coffincontaining his film career before going to the safe world of cbssaturday night carnage with this hysterically bad supernaturalactioner.for such a dumb movie this thing sure is plotty. norris is chicagocop frank shatter. first off, what kind of last name is "shatter"?have you ever met any shatters? genforum.com has no listing forthe last name shatter, which opens up any half clever viewer toreplace the "a" in shatter with an "i." he and his partner, calvinjackson, do the same old buddy cop routine you have seenbefore: make funny with the pimps, and make their captain mad.jackson, looking like the theoretical love child of whoopi goldbergand rick james, quickly wears on the nerves with his constantcomplaining and eddie murphy-patented facial expressions.shatter and calvin become involved with an emissary of satan,whom we are introduced to in the too long opening scenes.prosatano is a demon who is locked in a crypt by king richard thelionhearted. the demon's scepter, from which he gets his power,is busted into nine pieces and hid in nine different parts of theworld by holy men. in 1951, some grave robbers accidentally letprosatano out and he begins collecting the nine pieces. hedisguises himself as an antiquities professor named lockley andalways happens to be giving a lecture where a holy man is killedand a piece of the scepter is taken.norris brings in his "walker: texas blunder" cohort sheree wilson,who plays lockley's assistant. she helps norris with hisinvestigation, they make goo goo eyes at each other, and ourintrepid investigators travel to israel after a rabbi is killed inchicago. while in israel, calvin is given even more to complainabout: the heat, the lack of restaurant accomodations, the lousydrivers, and the fact that he is missing the chicago bulls playoffgames. norris even manages to work a cute israeli kid into thisnightmare. bezi steals calvin's wallet, and hangs around the men,leading them around israel and not arousing any sort ofappropriate suspicion.eventually, lockley (prosatano) assembles all of the scepterpieces, but needs the blood of royalty to complete the ceremonyand call up the devil. where to find royal blood? well, sheree'sfather is a duke! she has an american accent but she is thescreenwriters' convenient method of forcing this monstrositytoward its inevitable conclusion. sure, this minion of satan mayhave killed countless hundreds over the years, but how is hegonna do against a good old fashioned american butt kickin'?after prosatano has been vanquished, killed by his own scepter (ienvied him, he did not have to watch bezi steal calvin's walletagain), we are treated to an awful coda involving a bearded manwho has been watching shutter, i mean shatter, and calvin ontheir quest. you see, it was foretold...somewhere...that twowarriors from the west would defeat prosatano. the silentbearded man who watched over the couple was none other thanjesus...i kid you not. he is listed as "prophet" in the end credits,but you and even your pets will recognize the subtle christianreference the film makers are trying to exhibit here.like in "i use a walker: texas ranger," norris is aging and cannotget into his fight scenes too much anymore. he kicks a lot, andpeople fly over furniture in slow motion, and then norris gives all ofhis line readings in that monotone voice of his. oh, what a realdirector might be able to fashion out of him! his brother, aaron,who has directed him in other films as well, has no sense of storyor momentum. scenes are thrown in for ego's sake, not toentertain. the scenes when the dynamic duo first meet bezi dragon and on, and then bezi is not all that important to the rest of thefilm.the film was shot on location in israel, which means theamericans could insult the israelis in person. there is not onelikeable israeli character here. the israeli police captain is a jerk.the cops' driver does not know english, and calvin convinces himthat the word "sh*tty" is a compliment. nothing funnier thanmocking those stupid foreigners on their home turf, especiallywhen all this racist humor is coming from an american minoritywho would have been more than offended if the tables were turnedand the israeli cop was mocking the african-american cop inchicago.this film is badly written, badly acted, and badly directed. it doesnot work as action, cop drama, or even horror. it just shows thatthe now defunct cannon studios was willing to throw their moneyinto anything, no matter how badly it was planned. "hellbound" issurely a most adequate title. i disliked this movie intensely.this is rated (r) for physical violence, gun violence, strongprofanity, some sexual references, and some adult situations.

this film is bad. not so bad it is good. just bad. it is however hilariously bad. i watched it out of some morbid curiosity and never intend to watch it nor any other chuck norris film ever again. if you have to choose between this film and death, you should happily choose this film, however, as it is is a masterclass in terrible film making (hence the hilarity).it is a constant depression to me, as i grind away at my desk job, that some people get to be involved in movie-making and decided to produce things such as this.1 out of 10. still better than "starship troopers" however.

this is the worst film i have ever seen, so bad it is astonishing. i am glad that i have never seen that black sidekick in any other film: ok, it wasn't his fault that someone gave him those lines, but he could have refused the role, and tried to learn how to act instead. how did anyone get the money to put this film together. is there some corporation in hollywood that deals with trash for male college students with no brain? "oh yeah, they will love this one: it's got no believable plot, some kungfu movements, chuck norris, a black sidekick with bad corny lines, a sweet little israeli (or is he an arab, or does anyone care?) boy pickpocket, and the devil." brilliant, and many thanks to all concerned for enriching the human race.

i concur with the other users comment. hard to believe that this movie actually came out in 1994 because it screams mid 80's. i think it is dubbed because the sound and the picture don't always match up. if anyone can truly say this is a good movie, they need to be locked up. it is so sad how money has so much power over people that they will do anything to get it. i feel i lost intelligence from watching this. i used to have a little respect for chuck norris before i watched this but now i just feel bad. i bought this as part of a 3 movie pack for $9.99 and i can honestly say i would have been better off literally throwing the money away. forgive me jesus.

this piece of crap is actually the bomb, as in bottom of the barrel. i can't figure out which is worst; norris' dull portrayal of anonymity (not a great trait in an action protagonist) or christopher neame's hysterical overacting. this film doesn't deliver on any level what so ever. the action sequences are tame, the plot is paper thin, and the scenes that are supposed to be horrific look like a cliché from the fifties. you can't just fill a room with smoke and men in rubber suits, and expect the audience to scream in terror.visually the film does nothing for me. it actually looks like an unfortunate mix between a cheap porn flick and a miami vice rip-off with a little sprinkling of hell-spawn. no, wait. that should have been hell-yawn.

norris plays a chicago cop who stumbles upon a devil's apprentice? who wants to, well, create armegeddon. he eventually kills the creature by, get this, throwing a solid gold 24 inch spike, not very sharp, about twenty feet, hard enough to penetrate the chest. unlikely? so is the rest of the movie. much of it consists of cn and his sidekick driving cars and talking nonsense. the israeli (or arab) kid is there ostensibly to humanize cn. ok. doesn't work, makes no sense, and advances the plot, so-called, not one bit. also, no cops ever every get invited out of the country to be interviewed by other cops. it is ridiculous as a premise. the whole thing is bad. unfortunately, it's not so bad as to be entertainingly bad or campy. just plain bad. but--one can see how norris was trying to find his way to the successful walker: texas ranger series.

for the most part, i considered this movie unworthy of a comment, but the last 10 minutes prompted me to write one. you see, right then we learn (spoilers...if they can be called that) that the devil's emissary has no chance of properly preparing the domination of the world by his master, because he is not skilled at martial arts! "prosatanos" has been lying in a hole for centuries, waiting for "human greed" to release him, only to be defeated in a simple one-on-one match against 54-year-old former karate champion chuck norris! imagine what would have happened to him if he had taken on jackie chan... (*1/2)

low budget horror movie. if you don't raise your expectations too high, you'll probably enjoy this little flick. beginning and end are pretty good, middle drags at times and seems to go nowhere for long periods as we watch the goings on of the insane that add atmosphere but do not advance the plot. quite a bit of gore. i enjoyed bill mcghee's performance which he made quite believable for such a low budget picture, he managed to carry the movie at times when nothing much seemed to be happening. nurse charlotte beale, played by jesse lee, played her character well so be prepared to want to slap her toward the end! she makes some really stupid mistakes but then, that's what makes these low budget movies so good! i would have been out of that place and five states away long before she even considered that it might be a good idea to leave! if you enjoy this movie, try committed from 1988 which is basically a rip off of this movie.

this is a god awful norris film, with one of the most annoying performances ever in calvin levels and a weak script. the characters were terrible, and it has hardly any action,plus even chuck norris stinks in this!. christopher neame is very weak as the main villain, and the story was not very interesting plus norris seemed bored with the whole thing and i don't blame him as i was too!. calvin levels gives one of the most annoying performances in a movie ever, i couldn't stand as i was tempted to rip the tape out of my vcr, plus norris and levels had no chemistry together!. if your looking for some great martial art moves from norris don't go near this, however if you want a movie with an uninteresting story, hardly any action and bad acting look further!. this is a god awful norris film, with one of the most annoying performances ever from calvin levels, avoid it like the plague!. the direction is incredibly bad. aaron norris does an incredibly bad job here, with no suspense or thrills bland camera work, and keeping the film at a dull pace!. there is a little bit of blood and violence. we get 2 gory impaling's,ripped out heart, exploding body and a few gunshot wounds. the acting is really bad. chuck norris is not amazing as he usually is here and seemed very bored here, his one liners are flat, and his acting wasn't that great and i am a huge norris fan, this is his absolute worst! (norris still rules!).calvin levels is incredibly annoying here, his whiny wimpy performance severely grated me, i was so hoping for him to get it good!, but sadly he didn't. christopher neame is pretty weak as the main villain, his voice was cool, but he over acted big time!. sheree j. wilson is beautiful and did okay with what she had to do. rest of the cast are terrible. overall please avoid this it's not worth the torture, even if you are a huge norris fan (like me). bomb out of 5

this movie stunk. there is not much more to it. the final fight looked like walker taking on my grandmother, not some supernatural demon with the strength of ten men. i found the commercials more interesting. the plot twists and jokes could be seen coming a mile away. the only redeeming quality of this film was that it ended. avoid this at all costs...unless you enjoy bad chuck norris movies.

all i ever heard while being raised was equality of the sexes, and here we have a film that not only exemplifies imbalance, but continues through with a whole concept that one sex is better. all the while watching i was hoping for that redeeming quality to make the viewer feel as though there is hope for the future, and there wasn't. i'll admit to not finishing the film, i had to turn it off at the part where the old man whore told the genetic man adam that it was ok to be a whore and get, and i quote, "more tail than any man in the past time." i know not finishing it is a bad review on myself, but it is the responsibility of the writer and crew to develope a story that will keep a viewer interested, and they failed. this film betrays all true female nature qualities of the mother figure and the need for balance. instead it exemplifies what america ran by lesbian natzis would be like,and i'm not against lesbians. thank you mr. director! someone please give me a redeeming quality... wait i have it! there's no sequel!

pure schlock from beginning to end. the average 12 year old might find that it has an interesting take on discrimination. otherwise, it's a pure camp-fest endurance test. like one of those so-so episodes of star trek the next generation that thinks it has something important to say.you'll see every plot twist a mile off in this by-the-numbers romp. however, it's worth seeing for its portrayal of drag-king prostitutes, a brothel where young women pay old men to have sex with them (how's that for role reversal), and lesbian soap operas. the ghost of valerie solanis lives!

i don't think this can legally qualify as "film." the plot was so flimsy, the dialogue so shallow, and the lines so terrible that i couldn't believe that someone actually wrote the lines down, said, "holy sh*t! this is a masterpiece" and then actually pitched it to a producer. i, for one, am still dumbfounded and will forever remember this film as the mark of the degeneracy of intelligence in america -- that, and "crossroads," of course.

the plot - in the future when nearly all men have been killed by a y-chromosome-targeting virus, a (hot) female genetic engineer 'creates' a man in a chem lab - is intriguing. despite the somewhat promising premise, the movie falls flat in nearly every regard. the dialogue is laughable. the characters are paper thin. the exploration of a single-gender world is shallow. the worst part of the entire movie is the asian detective who delivers lines so cheesy and contrived that you'll want to vomit.i can't imagine how on earth this trash got produced. most of the movie is male bashing. "all men are violent." "all men rape women." "men are only animals." all of the women - even the 'closet hetero cases' - seem to display anger toward-, fear of-, and hatred for men. if you want to see a sci-fi film something along the lines of this movie's premise, you'd do best to look elsewhere.

they used footage of some real protest spliced with some woman talking about a society with no men to make it seem like these people were cheering for the 'gendercide' of men. the funny thing is, you can see a man cheering on his own death in the background.ok, the plot. some lady says there should be a society with no men, and the crowd in front of her (which contains some men) think its a great idea. so then all the men are killed or something. so there are no more.then this blonde scientist creates a man, but removes some chromosomes so he can't be violent. the male grows very quickly and soon is a full grown man. not long after, he takes the blonde's' volkswagen beetle and drives into the city where he's discovered. now you would think the lone man in a city full of lesbians would be the happiest guy ever but no way. the police chase him.i didn't watch the rest but it probably ends up that they've got to race against the clock and some people, or something bad will probably happen. somehow the man ends up in a stadium with some other men who want him to lead the rebellion. these brave warriors hiding in a stadium might have had some sort of plan which laid out the details of how they'd single handedly get rid of a planet full of women, but i didn't watch. and neither should you.if you're up late and channel surfing and this happens to come on, don't watch. watch anything but this. you'll find those ads for bowflex or the ones with women in bathing suits asking you to 'pick up the phone to meet women just like these' in your area will be more satisfying entertainment.(oh yeah, there's this funny thing when they're pulling in with their cars. i don't know what they did, it looks like they drove in real slow and careful but then tried to speed up the film to compensate but it just looks really weird.) the blonde girl was kind of cute and i'm feeling generous, so... 2/10.

... but had to see just how bad it could get. the plotline was thin to begin with, but it just kept getting worse. a female genetic engineering grad student uses her research on accelerated mitosis to artificially create a male, because a biological weapon used in ww3 killed off 97% of the worldwide male population. the surviving men are either high prices gigolos in back alley clubs, or crazed lunatics in run down football stadiums plotting to overthrow the 'lesbian conspiracy'. the entire process resembled the microwaving of a large bowl of jello. press a few buttons and ding you get a baby. not only that, but he will age to mid 20's in a month, and then begin to age normally (how convenient). eventually poor adam gets bored with the secluded cabin in the woods where his creator had raised him and steals her car to 'see the city'.this begins 90 minutes of unlikely chases, convenient plot twists, and several subplots that we never see resolved. as adam quickly learns, what men did survive are treated as outcasts/criminals, because they are dangerous beasts that cannot help there genetic predisposition to violence. the propaganda machines have been in full swing, scaring women into believing all men are rapists and murderers. this has led to lesbianism being the norm, the fall of christianity, female only reproduction via cloning, and oh yeah world peace among other implied results. all of which seem unlikely given that only ~30 years had elapsed since the war. adam stumbles from one bad situation to the next, all the while being genetically programmed to be non-violent and unable to really do much on his own behalf. with the fbi on his trail, madams looking for fresh meat, and his creator trying to recapture him (for herself it seems), he learns that violence is not limited to the male species after all.all in all, i would not recommend this movie.i did however enjoy veronica cartwrights portrayal of the 'love to hate her' director of the fbi, and julie bowen didn't do bad as hope the 'closet hetero' geneticist either.

this movie is awful beyond belief. it's a low-budget, badly written, piece of pointless garbage. but the saturday afternoon i stumbled across it on tv still sticks in my mind as one of the most entertaining i've ever spent in front of the television. the badness of this movie is epic -- maybe not ed wood epic, but close. the premise is hysterical (men are banned for being too dangerous and imprisoned in -- haw! -- football stadiums), the pseudo-dyke culture is laughably bizarre (there's an underground sex trade with women who dress up like men to service "deviants") and the "last man" of the title is a pitiful reincarnation of rocky from rocky horror picture show. i didn't get to see the end of it, which i have to assume was so dripping with syrupy "what have we all learned from this?" nonsense it would bring on an urge to brush the teeth, but everything in the first two-thirds was so memorably bad, even if the last third turned out to be a pale imitation of the rest, it's still worthwhile for anyone who gets a kick out of campy, stupid, brainless sci-fi b-flicks.

it's a male bashing bonanza. i saw this on sci-fi a while ago, and the idea seemed interesting. it could have been a good movie, and the plot itself i don't see as male bashing, but certain specific references to men get really annoying. i might still watch the movie again though because it does at least try to redeem itself by hinting that maybe the women in the movie aren't really as non-violent as they claim, but it still doesn't compensate for the really tiring male-bashing. i mean, i can understand a little, it's part of the movie's plot, but come on, it gets really tiring after awhile. not only that, but to assume that the majority of women in the world would accept becoming homosexual that easily and that the few remaining heterosexuals would be such a minority as to go "in the closet". it's just too unbelievable. there are far too many women out there with cultural or religious restrictions that would balk at this it is totally implausible. i mean i know its sci-fi, and i love sci-fi, but the best sci-fi has at least a hint of it being possible, and this is too implausible. the phrase "truth is stranger than fiction" came about because fiction has to at least seem plausible to be welcomed, but truth isn't always. this movie is not that. other than that, the movie does have some good acting and the eventual morals of the story, that something like what happened was wrong, do redeem it a little, but not enough.

this movie, although well shot and superbly acted, was awful. i felt as if i was watching a car accident--sure i kept watching but i really wanted to turn my head. the plot leaves little to be desired, was extremely disjointed, and the ending was abysmal. although, it did fit the tone of the movie, i was hoping for something to improve this movie. i still don't understand what the references to rabies and the child get bit by the fox at the beginning of the movie. fifteen minutes of plot that really didn't do much. it's really sad to see a movie with fine actors and a beautiful set wasted on such an awful, awful, story. there's not much more to say about this movie. save yourself the time and watch c-span. it'll be more uplifting.

this story is about a safari in africa that meets some guy named trent--who convinces them to look for a tribe of white babes. naturally, they turn out to be amazon warriors and capture the men. the rest is pretty predictable.this movie has everything you'd expect in a bargain basement movie about africa--the substantial use of often irrelevant stock footage, film of animals that are not native to the continent (such as orangutans, moose, coatamundis and ground hogs),a white actor in dark makeup playing a native, bad acting (particularly from trent--a handsome man with the personality of balsa wood), comic relief (sounding like chico marx), a guy dressed up in a gorilla suit and bikini-clad white women with perms who are supposedly fierce jungle warriors--like a tribe of angry female tarzans. by the look of it, my assumption is that the movie was made for under $49.95--including developing costs and paying for rental of the gorilla suit! but, what i didn't expect was an imdb score of 4.9. this is poor, but not that poor considering that this is a schlock production in every possible sense and there is no conceivable reason why the film is rated that high! now i am not saying the film isn't worth seeing--it's campy and stupid enough to make enjoyable viewing--particularly with friends. just don't expect anything resembling a professionally made or competent film.finally, here's a smattering of the dialog from this jungle classic:"oolama like strong white man. oolama want strong white man...""oonga-bunga" "me-te-tonga....no,....keeel ('kill') man"

the plot has something about white hunters captured by a tribe of white women in the african jungle/ plains.its a turkey and the some. what it really is is wildly mismatched footage from early sound and silent films mixed with badly shot recent(to the release) footage of men on a safari. there are scenes of a man in a gorilla suit, south seas natives at sea (used to represent people in the middle of africa), women in bikini's, horrible narration and a guy in a loin cloth with make up all over his body (racially insensitive i think so). this is a movie to sit and make fun of- but only with lots of alcoholic drinks and witty friends. at any other time this is going to be a chore to get through. its a bad bad bad movie. beyond that i'm speechless

abysmal pulp adventure exploitation in the jungle woman genre. lousy audio thankfully obscures the dumb dialog. and it's awfully talky for a movie about people who don't speak english. there's no adventure to be found here; it's a jungle adventure with cliffhangers and one wild animal attack that happens in flashback.three pale-face dopes wander the african wilderness and encounter warring man-hungry tribes of amazons. these wild women have advanced out of the stone age only so far as to invent makeup, shoes, and underarm hair removal technology. despite their desperation for "hus-bahnd," the ladies insist that they will fight the men and burn the weaker ones.the only thing of interest, as if there were any question, is the assortment of young women clad in animal skins cleverly designed like the bathing suits of 1951. plenty of wrestling and bad dancing mixed with stripless 1950s stripper moves. no nudity or appreciable violence. on the other hand, you may be humming the catchy native song for days.

the camals are coming is a rather disappointing british comedy from 1934. i purchased this because i like desert adventures and states on the box that it is a drama. it certainly isn't.it is about a couple who head for egypt to capture some desert drug smugglers.this would have been much better if it had been done as a drama instead of a comedy, which lets it down a lot. it is quite silly in parts. depsite this, there are some good action and location scenes.the cast is lead by jack hulbert with anna lee as the love interest.one viewing is enough for this movie. overall, a disappointment.rating: 2 stars out of 5.

i have seen both the mst3k version and the uncut version. i rather enjoyed it. either way, it wasn't that bad of a movie. sure it moved a bit slow at times. i liked it.as far as mst3k goes, they only did the movies they could get the rights for. not all the movies they ripped apart where bad movies, it was just so easy to make fun of them. take soultaker for example.joe estevez and robert z'dar's characters where so inanimate and boringly silly i couldn't help but laugh. i couldn't take them seriously. it really created a unique feeling though.vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script. a world better than 95% of the garbage in the theatres today. her role was played well. not too screamy not to masculine but just right. the camera really likes her in this movie. i would have casted her in that role after ready the script.anyways, this movie deserves a bit more credit than it is given. please watch the uncut version if you see the mst3k. it deserves that much.

first of all, since i'm one of the people who never saw the mst3k chopped up version of this movie, i can't comment on that.however, i did see the original version of this movie on the sci-fi channel and i thought it was just as good as anything else on that channel. in fact, i thought it was one of their better offerings.i've noticed in perusing the comments here that the people who write in detail about soultaker with a modicum of intelligence, thoughtfulness and maturity tend to like at least a few things about this movie and rightly so. in it's original cut, most reasonable people i think would probably rate it at least 4 or 5 stars out of 10. five is average to me and i think this movie is about average for a sci fi pic.in contrast to the above, i've also noticed that the reviewers who seem immature, dull and flip and as a result come off as boneheads from where i stand, are the same ones who can't find anything good about this movie and basically trash it without cause based mostly on seeing it chopped up and fricasseed on mst3k. or if they have seen both cuts it seems they were greatly prejudiced by the mst3k viewing to begin with.

every movie i have ppv'd because leonard maltin praised it to the skies has blown chunks! every single one! when will i ever learn?evie is a raving old bag who thinks nothing of saying she's dying of breast cancer to get her way! laura is an insufferable medusa filled with the holy spirit (and her hubby's protégé)! caught between these harpies is medusa's dumb-as-a-rock boy who has been pressed into weed-pulling servitude by the old bag!as i said, when will i ever learn?i was temporarily lifted out of my malaise when the old bag stuck her head in a sink, but, unfortunately, she did not die. i was temporarily lifted out of my malaise again when medusa got mowed down, but, unfortunately, she did not die. it should be a capital offense to torture audiences like this!without harry potter to kick him around, rupert grint is just a pair of big blue eyes that practically bulge out of its sockets. julie walters's scenery-chewing (especially the scene when she "plays" god) is even more shameless than her character.at least this harold bangs some bimbo instead of maude. for that, i am truly grateful. and if you're reading this mr. maltin, you owe me $3.99!

this movie is juxtaposition of various super bad tough guy biker characters, loosely connected but with no real storyline. some of the scenes are nicely filmed. if they took the same cast and crew, and made a movie called the gent who was the coolest character in the film and came up with an interesting and continuous story maybe it could be decent. as it is, prepare for a lame series of tough guy character intros, all of whom do nothing but ride bikes around the desert all day and cause trouble while all staying never getting sunburned and keeping their hair and clothes perfect and never needing to look for a home or money, etc. there was a sort of background story about the characters pasts various people that were killed and a treasure that was probably supposed to be the plot.

larry bishop, the writer/actor/director, focuses too heavily on the camera, music, and visuals. the film resorts to meaningless ramblings and vulgar monologues, which seem to have no purpose other than boring and irritating the audience. the actors experience a bumpy ride, from the film's start to finish, and are caught in one terrible smoke screen. the hell with the ride. the film is a bomb.the victors are presented as weathered vigilantes, who seek their own form of justice for what they see as lawlessness. they are bikers, anti-heroes, and protagonists. pistolero, played by larry bishop, is the revengeful leader of the pack. the gent (michael madsen) is trapped in his own crossfire of chaos and psychosis. comanche (eric balfour) is loyal, but mysterious. deuce, performed by david carradine, should have passed on the ride, and so should the ticket-buyers (if you decide to see the film, you'll be sorry, but you'll find out why). billy wings (vinnie jones) is a lewd and venomous character, completely filled with disdain.what puzzles me is how this film, with all of its continual ramblings and vulgarity, ever got anybody to invest in a ride that absolutely goes nowhere. ticket-buyers, take my advice: don't pay for the ride. please don't make the same mistake as the investors.the first fifteen minutes, or so, of the movie is confusing and unintelligible. the dialog, which rapidly turn into meaningless monologues, doesn't make any sense. the entire film is hell bent on going nowhere. poor dennis hopper is caught in the middle of a real mess. he, too, should have passed on the ride. there are decapitated heads, slashed throats, and nude females wrestling. it is clear that bishop doesn't know where he is going with the film. he gets entirely lost. but, by the end of the ride, you just won't give a damn. mama mia! stay home. and, by all means, don't take the ride. i rate this film a 1 out of 10, but this movie is so awful it deserves a zero.

i would not recommend it whatsoever. it was like getting stuck in the middle row of a theater, so i couldn't leave, and watching a part porn movie (except they didn't take their clothes off - it was the body language and definitely the language). i have to say i was embarrassed. filming was very low budget, no good dialogue. yuck. actors stunk except the two best characters who got killed off (?) and they were david carradine and dennis hopper. it did smack of kill bill and that old movie with the two guys who ride the dessert on their chopppers. you know what i mean. blablabla. the filming was grainy and just a very low quality. there was nobody in that theater that liked this movie, and the people around me were younger and tattooed.

once upon a time quentin tarantino was a relatively successful filmmaker.now, unfortunately, he not only makes terrible films, but puts his names to ones like this.a supposedly cool retro flashback to biker movies of the 60s and 70s, this plumbs new depths.believe you me, i enjoy it when a blouse falls off in a film more than the next man but even i felt kind of sleazy watching this. to use a word i never thought i would, its msysoginistic (you see, i can't even spell it.) the plot (in the vaguest sense of the term) is as incomprehensible as vinnie jones' accent, the fact his terrible acting does not stand our particularly is as damning a testament as one can think of.this is just terrible. shocking. it almost made me cry. in horror.

this is my first "awful" rating ever on imdb and i couldn't think of a more deserving film to honor it with. i hoped for entertaining trash and found trash of the saddest, dullest kind. i found a film which no one can possibly have cared a bit about, including its creator."hell ride", directed, written by and starring larry "friend of qt" bishop, has a simple plot about a hidden treasure and a trio of keys, two bands of bikers and a gruesome murder in 1976 which has yet to be avenged. larry seems fiercely determined not to tell this story, focusing instead of putting his swaying, strangely grimacing main character into situations where he can fondle women who pretend to like it. he also has a dialog containing enough horrible fire puns/metaphors to put one off the word "fire" for life.dennis hopper escapes complete humiliation, others are not so lucky. sometimes they hit the road on their bikes, making one feel even more sorry for michael madsen, since his high handles seems to add insult to the injury of having to appear in this film. there is plenty of silicon-enhanced nudity, but fairly little action and no humor whatsoever, making one wonder just what kind of an audience they had in mind.my guess is that most people who watch this film, including fans of trashy 60s biker movies, will feel cheated. do yourself a favor and revisit the real stuff instead.

this film oh my god this film is so poor , i'm amazed i managed to watch it all ..first off id like to say that vinny jones should only play a london thug period that's it end of story ..pisttolero is so unconvincing its almost comedy.. banging in dennis hopper and david carradine did not save this film .. in fact i think its a total comedy and as a comedy it deserves its 1 star..avoid at all costs .. vinny oh my god i thought i saw it all when he played that irish tinker :pi think the average viewer will realize that this film is maybe just a never will be type of film.. i cant see how anybody could actually fall this crap

this movie makes "glitter" look like "schindler's list." tarantino and the weinsteins really need to consider more carefully before putting their names on a product. green-lighting a p.o.s. like this, regardless of the friendships involved, is just bad business. larry bishop needs to be kept away from a movie camera at all costs. writer/director/producer/actor bishop shows that his skills are inadequate for any of those jobs. a vanity project gone south, "hell ride" allows usually good actors to chew the scenery... at least when the camera isn't centered on bishop's feeble attempts to steal every scene he's in. (which is virtually every scene!) my final three words on "hell ride" are stink, stank, stunk.

this is easily one of the worst movies i've seen in a long long time (and i've recently seen starship troopers 2!!!). i could find nothing to redeem this film. the acting, which is probably the best aspect of the film, is fair at best. michael madsen hams it up in his standard character persona. denis hopper doesn't seem to know what he's supposed to be. vinnie jones accent is bizarre. one positive thing is that leonor valera looks fantastic. her acting is pretty poor but i doubt that's why shes there.the dialogue is truly appalling. it is quite simply rubbish. i don't know who signed off on this but they really need to get professional help next time round.this film is the reason imdbs rating system should be able to include zero stars out of ten. avoid at all costs.

okay, so writer/director larry bishop obviously has some important connections and knows the right people in hollywood in order to produce his own film and fill up the cast with eye-catching names. good for him! now what he really still needs is inspiration and talent in order to come up with an actually worthwhile scenario rather than the overly pretentious and wannabe convoluted crap he penned down here. "hell ride" isn't a movie; it's a hectic and hopelessly inept fan-boy endeavor to bring homage to the notorious biker-flicks of the 60's and to the recently revived grindhouse cinema formula in general. with "hell ride", larry bishop embarrassingly fails in his set-up and there are many obvious reasons for this. he hasn't got a story to tell  or at least not a very interesting one  but gravely tries to cover this up through numerous redundant plot twists, loads of gratuitous and very women-unfriendly sleaze, overlong and piteous dialogs aspiring to be cool and giant amounts of senseless violence. the plot looks complex but can actually be summarized in one sentence. the ancient vendetta between two rivaling biker gangs flares up again with the arrival of a new member; a boy who may or not be the long lost son of a double-crossing wench that got executed back in 1976. that's it, seriously! all the rest, going from betraying gang members over to the recruitment of old timer members over to toying with his nymphomaniac informant girl, is all completely pointless and confusing padding material. another major problem in "hell ride" is larry bishop's very own tremendous and seemingly insatiable ego. he definitely shouldn't have rewarded himself with the role of tough and relentless gang leader, as that only comes across as incredibly pretentious and narrow-minded; especially when there are so many other and more experienced stars in the movie. granted, bishop starred in a couple of genuine 60's biker exploitation movies (like "the savage seven" and "angel unchained"), but that was a long time ago and he honestly isn't any good as an actor. maybe it simply was bishop's life-long dream to play a character that always outsmarts his enemies and for which every hot babe sexually craves, and just wrote a whole screenplay around it. the veterans in the cast, like dennis hopper and michael madsen, don't really bother to leave a plausible impression and i can't say i blame them. this whole production is lame and pathetic and i can't bring myself to recommending it to anyone, regardless of many beautiful babes parade around with bare breasts and naked butts.

larry bishop is 60-years old, dirty and not good-looking yet in this movie he's like a drug towards the women in their twenty's.a lot of movies have been claimed to be sexist but if any movie deserves that title it's this one.i can't even count how many boobs there were shown in this movie, probably more then hours larry bishop spend writing the script.the script is ridiculous, bishop and his gang argue, bike, party, have sex, kill people and the next day they argue, bike, party, have sex, kill people and the third day, well you get the idea.i like eric balfour and considering what he had to work with, he did pretty good as comanche.unfortunately this movie is about larry bishop's character pistolero who is so one-dimensional it's not even funny.he's also a horrible actor, and apparently he never intended to do the lead himself but everybody he asked said no so what was he to do? once he realized he was gonna do the lead himself, he probably did a re-write of the script so that he could touch up more ladies.although visually it's kind of good-looking, at least the biker-scenes and eric balfour isn't half-bad this movie is just a big mess.i hope to never see larry bishop in front of the camera again.

the worse film i have every seen. like the other honest reviewers, it is just an excuse for getting naked birds with their juggs out. don't get wrong, naked women isn't a bad thing but there is another film genre for that. boyfriends beware. i sold this to my girlfriend as a classic bike gang fest (due to reviews) to be greeted with every other scene full of naked women gyrating about the place. slap in the chops for me.what makes me laugh the most is all the dogey bike dives they went to in the film were full of models with the works cosmetically - what biker bars have these? they are usually slightly haggard with tattoos and far saggier juggs! completely unrealistic.the acting is terrible, loads of pointless swearing and a complete waste of time storyline.did anyone check out vinnie jones's attempt at an american accent? its as embarrassing as his football skills.avoid like the plague. the only reason you would watch this film is if you are a young lad who cant access p@rn and have nicked it from their parents movie collection for a few pervy kicks!

that's what i kept asking myself while watching this film. i mean the amount of nudity and sex was one thing but another part of the movie which gave its genre to the adult industry was its lack of storyline. really i just wanted to get up and leave during the whole movie, but i persisted. i persisted in the hope that maybe the storyline would get better, that there might be a good twist at the end. however i couldn't have been more wrong. in the end i persisted because i figured i could write a bad review for it if anything after watching it. i mean don't get me wrong there is nothing wrong with beautiful, sexy and vibrant women, but when the director only shows that along with a shitty story thinking it's what the viewer wants to see, it insults us all. to think we are all so shallow to only want to see burlesque from rep ratable, big movie industry players is preposterous. my advice: hire a different movie.

when a movie called hell ride comes out you expect a certain amount of biker cliché. with character names like "pistolero", "comanche" and "the gent" i braced myself for the worse and was punch in the face by just that. the dialogue, soundtrack and shooting style are standard for biker movies. dusty desert blurred from the heat as bikes coming tearing down the road while "cc rider" plays and they talk about sex and violence. yawn! the three leads were just ridiculous and unbelievable. seeing old men like bishop and madsen (in a freaking ruffled shirt) riding down a dusty strip of desert highway reminded me of two men trying desperately to relive their youth. poor eric balfour tried his best but with such poor material it got lost. even an appearance by dennis hopper in full easy rider swing, couldn't save it. and let's talk about the store bought tans shall we? many have compared this to tarantino's work. it is not even close. what makes tarantino's work so brilliant is he knows it's over the top so he just goes balls out and takes it as far over the top as possible. bishop took this film so seriously that it became nothing more than a poor copy of the exploitation genre.

this film is so bad it's hilarious. i watched hell ride half thinking it was a comedy, although i couldn't quite work out if they were actually taking the p*ss, or if this really was a serious attempt at making something decent. i notice it isn't listed here as a comedy so they must be serious! it's basically seems to be about a gang of pensioners who ride round on motorcycles shooting at each other and exchanging the most hilariously bad dialogue you can imagine. one scene inexplicably has two characters smashing bottles over each others heads, then showing each other 'get out of jail free' cards that they've made! also check out vinnie jones' accent, where the hell is he meant to be from?!? oh and there's a load of naked girls in it too, who for some unfathomable reason seem to want nothing more than to have none stop sex with these leathery skinned b*stards! the guy who wrote and directed it - a pee wee herman lookalike with a greeshan 2000'd beard and an orange sunbed tan - has for some reason cast himself in the lead role, maybe this is part of the joke, i don't know. actually, the more i think about it the more i'm sure this film is a p*ss take. it's produced by quentin tarantino and it's possible he's released this in humour as a bit of a laugh. it is a total rip off of tarantino's style, but just done really really badly. it is very amusing though, and i guess either way it could go down as a cult classic, either from being an amusing parody of the tarantino/rodriguez style, or something that is very very unintentionally funny. has to be seen to be believed.

larry bishop directs, writes, and leads this soft core porn, plot less biker movie about nothing to do with anything. to call this one of the worst movies of 2008 is being kind to the garbage that i spent money on while in theaters. its one of the worst movies i have ever seen. i felt sorry for the girls mostly, who probably think they're in the making of a feature film, when in all reality they're making a porno. they walk on the set for four days, say some sexual lines to disgusting old men -- thirty years older than them -- then take off their cloths, and run around naked for the four days they're on set. i can only assume this was larry bishops only way to get laid. you see shot after shot directly on a girls asses. shot after shot of bishop walking up to some random chick and grabbing her most intimate parts, as if he were shaking her hand. how this crap was even funded is beyond me. why tarantino has his name on it is beyond me, but he's been slowly fading away since 1994, so i can't say i was surprised.after 15 minutes, you get that awful feeling that only horrible (and i mean horrible) movies give you. when you see it in theaters, the pain you feel is amplified. after 15 minutes, i wanted to cry for being so stupid, and wasting, not only my time, but my hard earned ten dollars. there isn't one redeeming quality, or one moment in the movie that creates any kind of reaction or shows any kind of inclination that these people had any idea of what they are doing. if you don't see naked women all that often, then i guess this movie would be for you. if you're eleven-years-old, you will probably like it. you can't even laugh at it, because every idiot making it was laughing about the crap they were making. the acting is awful, the writing is awful, the production is awful, and the directing is awful. it's not even worth your time renting it to see the car crash. stay away, stay very far away. you shouldn't even be reading these reviews. i shouldn't even be writing one.

i have had more boring stretches of 80 minutes in my life, but none are coming to mind right now. hell ride is based on the retro cult 70s theme that tarantino brought back, and did right, in movies like pulp fiction and reservoir dogs. the problem with hell ride is, unlike pf and rd, the story is garbage and so is character development. how many movies does bishop think he can blatantly steal from? the brief case in pulp fiction, the air gun in no country, etc. etc. speaking of bishop what the hell is he doing acting in this movie? i couldn't help but laugh at those scenes where he's standing with his pelvis trusted out, desperately trying to seem like some hardened biker. nothing in this movie is believable. and why dennis hopper? did they really need the easy rider motif too? i blame larry bishop, for his horrible plot and dialogue, not to mention his failed attempt at the leading role. don't bother watching this movie, it's a waste of time.

director/lead larry bishop tried way, way too hard with hell ride. the movie wants to be edgy, witty, provocative, outlandish, biting all of this, seemingly in a quentin tarantino/rob zombie style. but it's not edgy. the references seem forced. the dialog tries to be clever and fails. the humor is never funny. nice try setting a gritty tone but we'd have to care about the characters or the story for it to remotely succeed.what you're left with are cool harleys and pretty girls surrounding a bunch of tired, old and out of shape "bad boys" in what looks like an attempt to do a modernized sergio leone western. if this movie can make newer generations interested in 60s and 70s films, kudos for it. but on its own, it is rather boring and irrelevant. i do believe there is a place for style over substance. but this movie is not it.

because that's what hell ride pretty much is. larry bishop and tarantino partying on the weinstein's money with the promise to deliver a movie sometime down the line. i'm all for fake boobage and booze as much as the next guy but did we really need the movie? really there's nothing worse than the reheated second-hand leftovers of an old trend. and i'm not even talking about 70's grindhouse cinema because hell ride has none of the raw and unpolished feel of the era it purports to pay homage to. no, this is slick and glossy mtv hollywood through and through. the old trend i'm talking about is the self-consciously pseudo-hip quirky cinematic world where tarantino meets guy ritchie and robert rodriguez. all three guys were at least talented and found success for a reason. hell ride is just a second-hand copy, fickle and uninspired, polished to the max when it should be raw, the "supercool" aspect coming off forced and silly.there's no reason for example why such a simple and utterly inane story has to be told in convoluted, back-and-forth in time fashion. it's just a post-tarantino quirk. there's also no reason why the dialogues have to be so mind-numbingly pointless, people flapping their gums while saying nothing: at least when travolta was talking about cheeseburgers in pulp fiction it felt fresh. dialogues here amount to little more than pseudo-macho posturing. there's also no reason why a grating rock'n'roll guitar has to twangle aimlessly over the entire movie. perhaps the lowest hell ride hits is when it tries to be quasi-existential. there's a hilarious dream/illusion scene in the desert where bishop eats peyote and sees colours. i was half-expecting an old indian to come out and offer nuggets of wisdom.the only saving grace of this abysmal turd is the boobage and vinnie jones' monologue about his wings tattooes (and maybe some of the desert exterior shots). lots of boobage and hot scantily clad babes. now that's something i can get behind but a movie they don't make. everything else is just an empty shell, an imitation of other infinitely more talented imitators.

tarentino should be ashamed to be involved with this awful film. the acting, directing and script are all third-rate - with the entire film playing out like an excuse for writer/director/star larry bishop to get laid. the only reason it was made at all is most likely due to his association with qt. the plot of the film is pretty flimsy, and basically tries to survive on not-so-obscure references to older b-movies and some cameos from guys like david carradine, dennis hopper, and vinnie jones. each one is listless in their performance, particularly hopper who is in full-on paycheck mode at this point in his career. the saving grace, if there is one, is that the script is so laughably bad that it can be entertaining. bishop tries so hard to get that trademark tarentino banter and just fails miserably, which can be pretty humorous at times and grating at others. i'd only check this one out if you love bad movies...or if you're really into biker films.

or that's what the filmmakers would like you to believe, anyway.this movie tries sooo hard to be cool it's ridiculous. everything, from the look of the film, the cinematography, the editing, the dialogue and the acting, is geared in super cool mode from the get go. just to make sure that no one misses how cool this film is, there's a soundtrack of really cool rock n roll tunes and a twangy western-surf-tex mex guitar playing constantly throughout the film. as a final reminder of how frickin cool this movie is, all the actors have been instructed to speak in a hoarse voice, because, as we all know, that's badass.the plot (if there indeed is one) seems pretty straightforward. but as someone else already pointed out, the director and star of the film, seems fiercely determined not to tell that story, instead focusing on a plethora of naked babes and dialogue that's supposed to be badass, but grows tired surprisingly quick (did they have an contest to see how many times they could cram the words "pussy" and "f*ck" and its derivatives in an 80 minute film?).this movie was absolutely horrible.

quentin tarantino once said that to succeed in the film industry you had to make your own pulp fiction or reservoir dogs. writer/actor/director larry bishop seems to have taken that advice a little too literally with hell ride and concocted a messy homage that borrows much too heavily in its visuals, music, camera-work, and time-altering storytelling. but to properly mimic a tarantino film, one has to have a knack for constructing creative conversations; unfortunately hell ride's primary derailing element is its atrocious ramblings and vulgar monologues that only work to disgust and confuse the audience while simultaneously invoking pity for the actors just for being involved.the anti-hero protagonist biker gang, the victors, consists of several weathered vigilantes who bring their own brand of bloodthirsty justice to the lawless roads. the leader, pistolero (larry bishop), is hell-bent on revenge and putting out fires. the gent (michael madsen) just tries to balance his chaotic, psychotic symphony of life with putting lead into anyone who crosses his boss, and comanche (eric balfour) follows with a fierce loyalty and a mysterious past.on the villainous front, deuce (david carradine) is the mastermind who orchestrates from afar, though not quite far enough, and billy wings (vinnie jones) spits venom and lewd explanations for his tattoos while toting a harpoon gun and a general disdain for life. while these characters might sound interesting on paper, once they're forced to rant horrendously ill-conceived dialogue all traces of cool disappear faster than the funding should for bishop's next film.while hell ride is riddled with imperfections and missed opportunities, the main facet of its undoing lies in the poorly devised conversations. and because bishop's main influences are the talky films of tarantino, there are a lot of them. the first twenty minutes of the movie are nearly unintelligible and would probably make as much sense muted. by the time pistolero's main squeeze is introduced and certain phrases are overused to the point of nausea, you'll pray for both death and the ability to turn the sound off. even dennis hopper has trouble remaining cool while spouting off such goofy dialogue.have you ever repeated a word or phrase to yourself so many times that it just doesn't sound right or even make sense anymore? bishop starts there and then keeps the madness going until you envy the characters on screen getting their heads cut off. and when the dialogue finally takes a break, we're treated to interspersed shots of nude female oil wrestling and throats being slashed. i'm not sure what effect bishop hoped to attain, but i doubt he found it.hell ride wants to pay homage to quentin tarantino films, robert rodriguez films, and every movie that idolizes the violent and devil-may-care attitudes of bikers. but while its intentions may be noble, the horrendously cringe-worthy dialogue and the hyper-stylized timeline-mangling editing prevents the audience from becoming invested with the generic tough-guy characters. by the time we figure out the mystery behind the characters' motives (and it may be awhile before you even realize there's a mystery to be solved), it's just too hard to care anymore. and while everyone on screen is clearly having fun, they've entirely neglected to translate any of that entertainment to the audience.- joel massie

definitely the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life. i can't find anything positive to say about this movie (if this production is even worthy of that word). this production is not even the standard of a low budget porn-movie!my question is simply: why did someone look at the script and think "hey i'm gonna make a movie out of this"?at the end of the movie i wasn't even hoping that "nicole" was going to make it. she was really that annoying!so for your own sake, do not watch this movie... unless you want to waste 85 minutes of your life...

first of all, just let me say this... ghost story....hello!?!if any of the other people who trashed this movie from beginning to end realized this fact, their reviews would have been very different. the fact that characters kept disappearing whenever the protagonist turned back to look, should have been a dead giveaway. this movie was not billed as a ghost story when you went to rent it in the video store, not even a hint, and that is the biggest mistake that was made by the studio who marketed it. it was deliberate on their part not to market it as a ghost story in order to confuse you like the main character is confused as you try to make sense of it. the problem in this is that they lost too many viewers; the ghosts appeared "too human and real" without any of the usual telltale signs, imagery or special effects that hollywood usually uses to let you know you are now seeing a ghost...and that, is what they were trying to do. the main character does not know she is seeing ghosts and neither does the viewer. now do you get it? as long as you understand that the main character is seeing ghosts, then you'll understand the movie and not be so irritated by what is perceived as major oversights in continuity or plot flaws.i admit, this being said, it still was not a good movie, just not as bad a just about everyone else made it out to be. just understand, if you plan on watching this movie, everything you see, "ain't" always what what you think it is. 4 out of 10 for acting, 3 for originality, 5 for plot and 5 for scare factor, though there was some gore and spooky moments. still not a good movie, just way misunderstood.

under no circumstances watch this film. it is terrible for a number of reasons:no plot no structure no direction no acting to speak of no visual style no tensionin a word - no.best thing about it the box and the fact it eventually ends. who would have thought 85mins could feel so long.once again: under no circumstances watch this film. it is terrible.no plot no structure no direction no acting to speak of no visual style no tensionin a word - no.best thing about it the box and the fact it eventually ends. who would have thought 85mins could feel so long.

continuing in the string of "stalker/slasher" flicks in the vein of "wolf creek," "hostel," "joy ride," etc., comes "rest stop." the most unoriginal and useless one of them all.we start, reasonably promising, with the violent death of a pretty young girl in a filthy restroom.this is where our interest is lost. we, then, move to the cliché road trip couple, on their way to la with their eyes on acting stardom. . . which, doing movies like this, they'll never achieve.from the sexual romp in the park, the couple drives, arguing all the way, to a deserted and disgusting rest area for the girl to use the bathroom. harmless enough until she exits and finds her boyfriend missing and realizes she's being stalked by a lame version of "joy ride"'s rusty nail. . . only driving around in mater from "cars".honestly, if this had been directed/written/produced/acted by anyone else, it might've been fairly good. but no.because then comes the ghost story. yup. . . you guessed it. plenty of "oh, i'll help you, but wait, you're dead" to "wait is this stalker a person, monster, or ghost?".but wait? who comes to the rescue to save the girl's life and possibly the movie? that one lawerence brother. excellent. we're saved. (sarcasm) oh wait, no we're not.you know. . . if you want to laugh off a pretty bad, or if you get free rentals like i do, give it a try.if anything, you'll learn how not to make a movie.-ap3-

obviously raw feed video is smarter than all of us who wasted our money renting this flick! they will make millions from video rentals and their low budget investment is going to pay off big, which will finance "rest stop ii" (unfortunately). i figure they spent a maximum of a few hundred thousand dollars american to hire the actors, rent the rest stop locale and burn a truck and drag a motorcycle along behind the truck for a bit plus pay for the technical stuff. that's it. we should all be as smart as these guys, i won't knock them for having the genius to promote a stinker into good monetary returns. premise of the movie was good, and it could have been a really adequate horror movie, but it failed by not delivering a clear story line. i am always looking for a gem from the upstart film companies, but i didn't find it here and neither will you. i'm only sorry i wasted $3.99 plus tax to find out.

seriously, folks...i was getting ready to actually write the razzie council and recommend this movie as razzie champ for 2007...until i got on imdb.com and realized its copyright date was 2006 and not 2007. seriously, though, this movie could have easily been a razzie champ. this movie sucked! how in the world this piece of crap was overlooked even for a razzie nomination in 2006 is beyond me, because it easily could have competed with basically, it stinks, too for the 2006 razzie championship.i rented this movie on the recommendation of a female neighbor of mine who told me, "oh my god, after seeing this movie, it's going to be a long, long time before i ever stop at a rest stop ever again!" i couldn't believe how not scary and awful this movie was! possible spoilers below, not that you'll be missing out on anything.ok, first of all...the problem...the rest stop itself. obviously the director of this piece of crap doesn't know the first thing about women. the toilets in that rest stop were on the same level as the one in the movie trainspotting. i don't claim to know everything there is to know about women, but one thing i do know is that women, for the most part, are total and complete hygiene/neat freaks. given the choice between taking a crap on either of those toilets and possibly catching something or squatting in the woods, a woman is going to opt for squatting in the woods. i know, because i've gone camping with them before, and they have no problem squatting in the woods. so right there...major plot hole and untruth.second of all...she comes out of the rest stop, and her boyfriend who drove the car is nowhere to be found, not him nor his car. he just left. she starts screaming his name, wondering where he is. ummm...hello? you're standing on wet mud...did it ever occur to you to look down for some tire tracks? i mean, his car is gone...it didn't just get up and fly away. and actually, that makes me think...i actually was looking down at her feet, and there weren't any tread marks in the mud. how...exactly...did that happen?third...the bible thumping mobile home family with the freak midget in the back taking polaroid pictures...wtf!?!?!?? they made absolutely no sense at all, and it's as if the director just threw them in to be weird for the sake of being weird. they made no sense at all and had no place even being in the movie.fourth...oh my god, this...i mean, finally...near the end of the movie...she finally sees the escape hatch on the ceiling inside the rest stop. i'm like, "you...dumb...bi**h. you've been locked up in this rest stop for all this time...and you just..now...see...the escape hatch on the ceiling?" i mean...it's like they threw that in just because the killer tossed gasoline on the floor through the window and was getting ready to light a match. so she needs to get to higher ground to avoid being burned, and...oh, look! a perfect reason for her to get to higher ground! an escape hatch on the ceiling! it's like...why didn't she go through that before? most people in that situation would have seen that from the moment they were locked in that rest stop and gotten the f**k out of dodge. when they showed that escape hatch at the end of the movie, i was like, "you have got to be kidding me."fifth...what was the deal with all the of people she encountered continuing to just disappear? the girl in the broom closet in the rest stop? the dumb cop? her at the end of the movie when she ended up in the broom closet herself? it was never explained. personally, when they did this, i thought to myself, "oh, christ on a cracker, it's her. she's the killer. wonderful. she killed all of those people, doesn't remember doing it, and the writers of this movie just ripped off a certain french horror flick that i can't mention on imdb.com or i'll be blacklisted for giving away the ending (that movie sucked, by the way, too, people)." but it wasn't. she wasn't the killer, and the whole deal with the dead people disappearing was never, ever explained. oh, for the love of god, people, stay away from this movie! this movie sucked balls, and i have now got a serious bone to pick with my neighbor. it's on the 2 for $1 rack at family video, don't even rent it if someone gives it to you for free!

i have seen a lot of movies. in fact i love b horror movies, they are one of my favorite genres. however this "garbage" (i refuse to acknowledge that this was given the honor of film) was the worst piece of crap i have ever had the torture of watching. i actually signed up on imdb purely for the fact that i needed a way to at least voice how awful this "garbage" was. i have watched "films" (they at least deserve the honor) done in basements by high school students that were better written and directed. i have nothing but pity for the poor actors in this "garbage" because they were just trying to earn a pay check. they will now and forever have this stain on their records like a virgin who was raped and given herpes! if writer/director john shiban has any dignity left at all, after obviously fellating countless people to get this made, he should never allow himself near a camera again and try applying his so called "gifts" to something more suited for him....like mopping the floor of a peep show!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

the only good thing about this movie is, that i now have a movie on the worst ever list. rest stop being on the end of the spectrum where i can compare all terrible movies to. really, this movie is the worst plot, worst directed, throughout the whole movie all i wanted to do is pull out my hair and kick the writer's and anybody who made this movie possible's ass. i am a deployed soldier, and when i spend my precious downtime watching movies like this. these people should feel terrible, they had to of watch this before it came out, and must have been to freaking lazy to redo , after they noticed it freaking sucked. i am so amazed that this great country of ours is letting them make another. honestly, this is the first time i have ever commented on a movie, i had to let the world know, not to waste their time. delete this movie from the face of this planet. it makes us humans look retarded.

i cant put it any simpler than that, this is a terrible film. i've worked in the industry and made several (short) films myself, so okay my standard is pretty high but seriously, i absolutely hate this film. i haven't made a comment on imdb before but i hated this film so much i literally had to come and warn others. it is a piece of sh*t. the writer/director is an idiot who just has no idea how to make/write a good film and has the writing skills of an adolescent teenager. the characters are unrealistic (the lead woman doesn't think of taking the policeman's pistol yet is resourceful enough to improvise a molotov cocktail? please...) and not even likable, hell i hated her and cheered when she died. i don't understand what the director was trying to do with his demon redneck idea, but it just looked like sloppy writing and convenient bullsh*t with no real thought behind it to me. this is officially the worst movie i've seen all year. congratulations shiban, you now rank up there with such greats as micheal bay in the prestigious "shouldnt be allowed to waste millions of dollars on making a film" club. i hope you read this, i really do. and to the 163 idiots that rated this film 10 out of 10 bwahhahahahah oh my god i hope a redneck demon appears conveniently behind you and tortures you.

spoiler wolfcreek meets texas chainsaw massacre....if you've seen those, don't waste your time with this one. typical slasher movie, nothing new here except for the spoiler "visions" which just add fluff to an already weak plot. i would recommend this movie if you have absolutely nothing to watch and it's either see this movie or stare at a bare wall for 1.5 hrs. the only semi-interesting part spoiler is when the chick starts drinking in the empty sheriff's office, i say it's interesting because at least she made good use of that liquor instead of stereotypically using it to start a fire to kill the bad guy, although she did go that route towards the end. all in all, lame, bad, and not worth effort.

ben, (rupert grint), is a deeply unhappy adolescent, the son of his unhappily married parents. his father, (nicholas farrell), is a vicar and his mother, (laura linney), is ... well, let's just say she's a somewhat hypocritical soldier in jesus' army. it's only when he takes a summer job as an assistant to a foul-mouthed, eccentric, once-famous and now-forgotten actress evie walton, (julie walters), that he finally finds himself in true 'harold and maude' fashion. of course, evie is deeply unhappy herself and it's only when these two sad sacks find each other that they can put their mutual misery aside and hit the road to happiness.of course it's corny and sentimental and very predictable but it has a hard side to it, too and walters, who could sleep-walk her way through this sort of thing if she wanted, is excellent. it's when she puts the craziness to one side and finds the pathos in the character, (like hitting the bottle and throwing up in the sink), that she's at her best. the problem is she's the only interesting character in the film (and it's not because of the script which doesn't do anybody any favours). grint, on the other hand, isn't just unhappy; he's a bit of a bore as well while linney's starched bitch is completely one-dimensional. (still, she's got the english accent off pat). the best that can be said for it is that it's mildly enjoyable - with the emphasis on the mildly.

i hated it. i hate self-aware pretentious inanity that masquerades as art. this film is either stupidly inane or inanely stupid. after the first half hour, i fastfowarded through the dvd version, and saw the same juvenile shennanigans over and over and over. i became angered that i had spent hard-earned money for sophomoric clap-trap. tinting drivel in sepia or blue does not make something a movie, let alone art.

i will commend it in only one respect.. it was innovative. innovative doesn't mean it's a good film, it means that it can give you an idea of what you can take and implement in your own films.the simple plot is.. well.. simple. i got to the point where i didn't care if they destroy the building or not. if i had to hear that girl's annoying giggle one more time, i swear i would hurl the dvd out the window. and there's also the protagonist. they try to make him lovable, but he's a freakin pervert! sniffing the girls bra, sneaking peeks at her when she's naked, putting her bra over his eyes when he sleeps, putting her bra on a blow up sex doll (which she takes her panties off while hes asleep and slips them on his doll.. umm)what irritates me even moreso is that crappy tinting. in the photo gallery on the dvd, you can see what the film looked liek before they greyscaled it and put in a color tint (digitally too).. the film looked a lot better without the effect.. so they sacrificed it being a good film just to be artsy... bah. i could understand using gimmicks like that if the film quality was crap..i think most people who liked this film just liked it because the chick was naked for a good 5 - 10 minutes. this doesn't compare to delicatessen ( like so many are tryign to do). delicatessen has characters you can get into and like.. these people here just grunt and giggle.lastly, i would also liek to point out that this was also tryign to be like a german impressionistic film liek the old silents. one of the problems with most foreign, especially artsy, films is that thety focus on making an artsy composition and forget about the 'space' of the scene. it results in the audience not really understanding what;s going on because they don't get a sense of the space of the surroundings.anyway, it's rubbish. the short film on the dvd, surprise, was a heckuva lot better.

i always say, "there's nothing like a good movie". and i must say, this was nothing like a good movie! drab, dull and tedious. it was like one of those bad dreams that never seem to end, no matter how hard you try to wake up. i don't mind the concept of a film without words, (ie: entering a fantasy or dream world), but there has to be something there to capture your imagination, not just empty images, which is what this film is. there seemed to be no character development and it jumped so fast from scene to scene that it was hard to discern any story. (was there even a story?) you could tell the actors were trying their best, but unfortunately, poor direction sabotaged all the actors' work. it really seemed like a type of cinematic masturbation...only existing to pleasure the director and nobody else. big waste of time.

i had a different experience with this movie - it never got charming, or delightful, or funny for me. one big clue that this was not your typical movie was that the label gave no indication of the ianguage(s) spoken in the film. another was the lack of choices re subtitles.i found the lack of dialogue annoying, especially when accompanied by exaggerated facial expressions as it almost always was. the wildly inconsistent development of the feeble plot was puzzling. were there characters, or only vague gestures? was there even a plot?on a separate matter, i'm getting prompted to correct the spelling of "dialogue", with the suggested substitute of "dialogue". maybe this movie in its entirety, including the imdb portion, is designed to puzzle, or amaze, but i'm getting more irked than amused.

like the other comments says, this might be surprise to those who haven't seen the work of jeunet & caro or emir kusturica. but have you already seen delicatessen, there is nothing new it this film. i thought delicatessen was great when it came out, but this film just arrive too late to be of any interest. i don't think it's a worse film than delicatessen but it's a bore to see it now, like it probably would be to watch delicatessen again. there is really no point to the film, nothing that really matter or stays with you. there may be a distant similarity to the films of kusturica, but he's really in a different league, so you should rather go see his films than waste your time on tuvalu.

you know, this is one of those "emperor's new clothes" films. it's like, so off the wall and strange that you're supposed to like it if you're really into film. well, i think that's a bunch of bologna. films like this which hide under the cloak of dada or surrealism make me nuts. some person has this bad dream, perhaps brought on by eating the aforementioned bologna right before going to bed, remembers most of it (unfortunately) and then puts it on film and we're all supposed to marvel at their creative genius. i have bizarre dreams too, sometimes, that make absolutely no sense but i don't feel the need to put them on film, expose everybody else to them and call it art. weirdness does not, in of itself, mean something is interesting. true dada or surrealistic expression has some intent and intellectual thought behind it. if other people don't get it, that doesn't make it profound, it just makes it incomprehensible. bizarreness for bizarreness sake, for me, is not good, let alone great, art. and comparing "tuvalu" to "delicatesen" is like comparing "the godfather i & ii" to "the godfather iii"---same genre, not in the same league.

one of the worst movie i have seen in 2009 so far: the story hesitates between a silly thriller or a dumb comedy.as nothings happens, the void is filled with long, boring dialogs that don't make any sense! the cast is famous but doesn't bring any emotions except to fast-forward the play! and it happens in a plush seaside hotel that looks really gloomy. in comparison, the one of the "shining" is funfair! nb: a lot of users think that it is located in the french riviera! they are wrong! it isn't the south of france (nice, cannes) but totally the opposite: cabourg & normandy, to be simple the beaches of the d-day! that's why the sea is as grey as the sky and there isn't sun!

it seems to be a common thing in the 90's to play with cliches. some manage to do so with great talent. hervé hadmar doesn't. on the paper, the movie looked interesting though: the weak plot could have been saved by great moments of comedy, dark humour, and a very "décalé" style. director hadmar, unfortunately, kills his direction with his camera angles and his absolute lack of rhythm. every joke is embarassing as no one reacts in the theater. the movie is incredibly slow, and the actors seem to be wondering what the hell they're doing in this ridiculous mascarade. what could have been a stylish funny mindless comedy ends up being a cathedral of boredom.

this movie really sucks. this is my second review because its so bad. the girl on the cover is hot but the girl in the movie is not. i cant believe it was rated r there is basiaclly no violence, no sex, no nudity, no swearing nothing. really crap film.

bad editing, bad production values, bad continuity, implausible, bad dialogue... this movies is bad, bad, bad. however, if you want a movie to poke fun at (a la mst3000), this is your movie. i wouldn't suggest spending much money on it, but if you do see this movie, make sure it's with plenty of witty, like-minded buddies.

i saw this on cable. someone had to lose their job for greenlighting this one for air. just because a movie is made does not mean it has to be shown! savage instinct should be shown in all film classes. it is the perfect template for how to not make a movie. the editing alone is so jumbled you'll think it was assembled by a team of trained (poorly) monkeys, traveling across unpaved canyon road in the back of a jeep, blindfolded and drunk. the audio is often not legible. acting? i can't call anything i saw here acting. reciting? hmmm. can't call it that either. failing? that works. all that being said...it is hilarious! i cannot stress enough that there is not one redeemable factor in this "film" other than the hilarity derived from it's own incredible ineptness. fun, in a strictly masochistic sort of way. watch it...if you dare.

if you like really shocking movies this is for you. the acting is the worst i've ever seen and the story line goes no-where. if you come across this film in your video shop don't even consider borrowing it. the chick on the front cover isn't even the one in the movie.i gave this movie 1/10 only because i couldn't vote 0. avoid it at all costs.

susan inadvertently stumbles onto a drug smuggling ring while her realtor gets a flat tire while driving her to see a house. the leader of said drug ring, mongo (whom only has one week until retirement) thinking she knows much more than this bubbly blond actually does seeks to make sure she won't tell anyone anything and thus begins one of the more bone headed films that i've sat through.all the actors in this film can't really act in the least. susan makes a pretty ineffectual hero for most of the movie (she'd never escape multiple times if not for the fact that seemingly every one in the movie wants to have sex with her) and she doesn't take the offensive until the last 20 minutes of the flick. when she does she spouts some generic "i have had enough" line, preach on sister, that very thought ran through my mind multiple times when i was watching this my grade: d-

i just finished watching this movie and am disappointed to say that i didn't enjoy it a bit. it is so slow slow and uninteresting. this kid from harry potter plays a shy teenager with an rude mother, and then one day the rude mother tells the kid to find a job so that they could accommodate an old guy apparently having no place to live has started to live with his family and therefore the kid goes to work for a old lady. and this old lady who is living all alone teaches him about girls, driving car and life! i couldn't get how an 18 year old guy enjoy spending time with an awful lady in her 80s. sorry if my comments on this movie has bothered people who might have enjoyed it, i could be wrong as i am not british and may not understand the social and their family structure and way of life. mostly the movie is made for the british audience.

this is one of the most stupid and worthless movies ever. it really does not qualify for movie status. it is very cheap (apparently shot on videotape), horribly acted, and just plain rotten. i could not believe how cheap and inept this piece of crap was. it looked like a home video! i mean i believe a guy i know a few houses down must have dug out his video camera and made this crap in 2 or 3 hours. it is that bad. i noticed the name from whence this cameasylumand i will never rent anything with that name on it again!!! when you rent a flick, check to see if it is from this "company." one thing is true though--if you like horribly acted, amateur movies, then you might like this loser. it is absolutely boring and terrible!!! you have been warned!!!

i had to suffer through this movie three times while i was a zombie extra in the director's new movie after sundown. the first time that i saw this movie the director was standing next to me and a clearly fake and cheesy looking hand popped out of nowhere and grabbed one of the characters. i could not take it any more i busted out laughing right in front of the guy. the movie has no direction whatsoever and the one thing that could make this movie decent (female nudity) was nowhere to be found. i am a fan of low budget horror movies, but this was just too much for me. the worst part was that i had to watch it so many times. also do not expect the new movie to be any better.

the fanglys is set in a small texan town called layton on the eve of halloween as the townspeople treat it like the second coming of christ or something, i mean halloween isn't that important is it? anyway, sheriff pete (burton gilliam) has been called out to yet another murder as local boy ned (co-associate producer john william galt) has discovered a body in the local woods. could it be the fang lady (justin hamilton)? the central character involved in a local legend about a witch who kills teenagers, who knows? being the fun sort of guy he is mark (asisstant director & producer robert harvey) convinces his missus kelly (laurie reeves) to ride out to a cemetery that his mate steven (josh gobin) found the night before for a halloween party. the idea of spending the night in a cemetery in the middle of the woods obviously appeals to kelly & she agrees, along with steven & a girl he picked up named camille (natalie woods) & their nerdy friend jerry (tim boswell) they all set out for a night of fun, well as much fun as you can expect to have in an isolated cemetery. however they soon discover that the legend of the fang lady is far from the bedtime story many make out...edited, executive produced, written & directed by christopher abram the fanglys is a pretty rubbish attempt at a horror film. the script is very predictable, dull & doesn't deliver any sort of entertainment value whatsoever, in the right hands & with a decent budget the fanglys could have been an effective horror film but as it is it isn't. it moves along at a fair pace but the on-screen 'action' is so poor that it doesn't matter, i don't quite know what else to say other than the fanglys is a really bad film & i can't see anyone getting any sort of enjoyment out of it. the dialogue is basic, the character's are clichéd & lifeless while as a whole the film seems a lot longer than the 90 minutes running time. there are a few lame attempts at humour which don't sit that well along side the horror elements & what was that retard keeping in that cage? i'd imagine the budget didn't allow the filmmakers to show it. oh, if you want to know what happens to jerry at the end then you'll have too keep watching past the end credits as the lame truth is revealed, assuming you can actually make it that far of course (believe me it takes some doing).director abram doesn't do anything special. abram thinks bathing scenes in neon light is stylish, i can tell him that it isn't when your film is supposed to be set in the woods. there's no atmosphere, scares, tension, excitement or any of the elements that makes a good horror film good. forget about decent gore, there's a bit when someone eats some skin off an arm & a pitchfork stuck through someones throat.apparently the fanglys had a filming budget of $2,837 which makes it one of the lowest budget films ever to have a commercial release, & to be brutally honest it shows. what about the retarded guy & his false joke shop teeth that look ridiculous? the terrible special effects, the camcorder cinematography & the terrible acting from everyone involved that makes it even more of a pain to sit through.the fanglys is straight-to-video crap, it has no redeeming features whatsoever & it's low imdb user rating score is fully justified, it's one of those films that within half an hour i was looking at the clock & wishing the thing would just finish.

this film is terrible - honestly. the acting is terrible, the script made me cringe, the effects are completely lousy (which i usually don't mind for older films, but this was made just two years ago), and everything about it just annoys me. a few friends go out on halloween into the woods and meet a witch and her cannibal son. of course, before that it has the cliché "you really believe that? ha ha ha, it's just a story" routine dragged out for a while. the witch's cannibal son was made a retard (i don't know if it was for comedy or to make it creepy, but this film failed at both). it has minimal gore and no nudity, which made a bad film even worse. heck, the only good thing about this film is the leg eating scene, and even that could of been better.honestly, don't even waste your time watching it on cable, and certainly don't consider buying or renting this, else you'll be kicking yourself for wasting time which could of been spent doing something more constructive or entertaining.

yes, it's a sbif (so bad it's funny) classic. with a budget running into the tens of dollars, some of the most abysmal acting you have ever seen, and absolutely no even remotely frightening moments - not even a nanosecond! camera work was at the elementary school level - one still shot outside a house was obviously hand-held and jiggled crazily. blood looked like watered-down cherry koolaid, someone made a trip to the local butcher shop for the "human" bones, and miss witch had the cheapest mask wal-mart could provide.did anyone involved look at the final cut and realize what a mess this was? most of the names in the credits have to be pseudonyms, it would be career suicide to have this on your resume. do yourself a favor and watch ebert's video of his colonoscopy instead!

i went into this movie with an open mind. i had been too lazy to go to the video store to pick out a movie, and my friend returned with this. i promised him i wouldn't laugh at his choice, but within the first five minutes i told him i would have to take back my promise. we kept watching, just hoping it would get better, but no; a continual mind-rape followed.this "movie" was probably one of the worse ever committed to film, and surely deserves a place on the imdb bottom 100. i really don't know how this got distributed. the lighting was poor. i have seen better acting in elementary school plays. there is really nothing positive to say about it.

director john madden, of shakespeare in love fame, gives us another pretty bad film in ethan frome. the plot centers around a new reverend coming into the town of starkfield where he learns the story of the local crippled man ethan frome's sick wife and one-time romantic tryst with the maid. adapted by richard nelson from pulitzer prize-winning author edith wharton's novel, this film isn't interesting in the least thanks to an abysmally weak script and poor direction that turns scenes that are supposed to be poignant into laughable schmaltz. still, there are other aspects apart of the film that work - the cinematography is well done, rachel portman contributes a lovely score, and while no one is at their best, liam neeson, joan allen, patricia arquette, and tate donovan work well in their roles. but overall, ethan frome is only marginally worthwhile and is easily forgotten.

john madden's cinematic interpretation of edith wharton's ethan frome falls short of doing justice to a great literary piece. while the story is maintained the elements that give the novella its soul are skewered and all in all lost in the film. madden fails to convey the innocence, and overall tragedy of ethan and mattie's relationship instead transforming it into a morality tale. the mark is missed and the point lost in added details and poor dialog. zeena (zenobia) in the book is almost completely the antagonist, the books least sympathetic figure, where in the movie she can be almost pitied though it's a stretch you kind of feel bad for this sick woman who is being cheated on. the book more accurately describes zeena's tyrannical control of the house and of ethan. the movie just ticked me off. the addition of the fox was pointless, as well as the scene with mattie trying to kill herself. it was just poorly interpreted and done. film mistakes: ethan's elusiveness in the church dance scene, interactions with denis eady, addition of love scene, fox scene, store scene, saying his plans allowed, lack of displays of ethan's inner emotions and thoughts, introduction of the priest instead of nameless engineer, let on to much that zeena knows about the growing relationship where in novel reader never knows what zeena is thinking or aware of. just too many flaws and poor directing decisions.

although i found the acting excellent, and the cinematography beautiful, i was extremely disappointed with the adaptation.one of the significant portions of the novella is the fact that ethan and mattie decide to kill themselves, rather than go on. this is never presented in the movie, they show it as if it were a sledding accident.the character changes in mattie and zenna are almost non-existent. while in the novella they almost change places, at the end of this adaptation it appears as if they are both invalids.lastly that mattie and ethan consummate their relationship fully nearly destroys the power and poignancy of the finale.the change of the narrator being a preacher was one effective change.neeson and arquette are superb in their portrayals. joan allen was also wonderful, however her character was much watered down from whartons novella.i do not expect films to faithfully portray novels, but this one went to far and in the process nearly destroyed the story.overall, i would not recommend watching this film unless you have read the book as you will come away confused and disappointed.

let me first state that i really really wanted to like this film. for the most part the actors and actresses looked their parts, and did fairly well in their roles, but the movie lacked any real plot. it seemed so wraped up in seeming 'wacky' that no interesting story ever shone through. also, the camera work was often sloppy, attempting snatchlike camera work and failing miserably. most of the time, shots meant to look cool ended up being confusing. perhaps something was lost during translation, but some of the characters were just... stupid. the crazy pretty boy who sniffs people like a dog? uhhhhhhh. ok. overall, a fat stinking 1/10. not worth your time.

i'd heard this japanese flick is edgy, creatively interesting, a "cool new thang" on the asian movie-making scene ... maybe even something as innovative as hideo nakata's "ringu" or chan-wook park's "oldboy", especially the latter.you can imagine my disappointment when, instead, i found the movie disjointed both narratively and cinematically (though not in a way that a film aficionado appreciates), cliché-ridden, even sadly silly instead of funny --- on the whole, a very bad knock- off of the "pulp fiction" style.i stopped watching after 30 minutes, when i gave up on it becoming something more than it is.

this is another of those films i can remember from when i was a kid and i recently managed to acquire it off ebay - 20 years on, it's nowhere near as good as i remember it being.the story is 'vaguely' kick started, by a 'cosmic event' (there's another extra film-crew member in the credits for 'weak story development') which makes collective ants become super intelligent. ant species who used to war with each other have ceased rivalries and are now working together. the thing i wanted to know throughout was, to do what exactly? you never find out what they want. nigel davenport and his sidekick travel out to the desert where bizarre ant activity has been noted, and begin to study the ants from an impregnable igloo shaped laboratory. probably the most chilling scene in my opinion was when the two scientists visit the giant square in the crops (like a square version of a crop circle) a result of the ants chomping away.this film was not very scary quite simply because you don't know whether to fear the ants or like them. all you know is that the ants want people to leave the area so they can get on with their hijinks - but you don't find out whether they are really baddies. it ain't a sci-fi because the 'cosmic event' explanation is too vague to be properly taken into account. it is deffo more of a chiller. tbh the flares, daft hairstyles, tight shirts with big collars and nigel davenports unnaturally big facial hair-do freaked me out more than the ants! did you notice that there are only six actors listed in the credits? yup, that right - six, and you won't see any other human beings in this film at all. not even in the distance! this is a plainly obviously low budget film which is a bit watchable because you probably won't have seen one like it. i can't think of any anyway. the filming of the ants is pretty good, they must have done months and months of filming before they had the shots they needed to stick in the film. you may well say to yourself 'how the hell do they get the ants to do that?' over and over, but it is all quite simple. you will also notice that the film makers sacrificed millions of innocent lickle ants to make the film too, so animal rights peeps stay away! good for novelty value, but you may not watch it more than once.

humour is a very individual thing and the audience at the sneak preview of the wog boy seemed to enjoy it more than i did. i found it an anachronistic affair, more representative of the old fashioned racial humour of the australian cinema of the 1960s and 1970s. the boy meets girl plot never takes off because of a lack of chemistry between lucy bell and nick giannopoulos while i found laughs thin on the ground. if you want to spend your money on this, wait until it's on video.

i'm glad i didn't pay to see 'the wog boy'.i sat there hopefully waiting for something original and/or funny to happen.it reminded me very much of those predictable english comedies of the 1970s.i won't bother with a synopsis of the plot, i suggest you do something else for 90 minutes

i really wanted to like this film however after an amusing opening few minutes i hardly cracked a smile. i agree there was no chemistry at all between the two leads and the other characters were cliche ridden. the script totally wasted the talents of bud tingwell and kim gyngell.it must be said however that there was plenty of laughter around me and even a smattering of applause at the end. perhaps i just couldn't relate to it enough. i'm just glad i went on cheap tickets.

this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times! lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing. i have to admit that the whole audience i was in was laughing hysterically but the majority were greek or italian so i guess that this humour will probably make them laugh but not me. all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes. god, and i can never get that 90 minutes back!

this is the first movie i have watched in ages where i actually ended up fast forwarding through the tedious bits which there are plenty of. very ordinary movie. i'm glad i missed it at the movies & got a 2 for 1 video deal which included this movie instead.

after seeing the tv commercials for this film i marched to my local cinema expecting a lot of laughs. in the end it was one of the longest 90mins i have ever spent. the wog boy really did fail to provide a story line with enough substance to hold my interest and predictable and sometimes tasteless jokes didn't fill this void.a scene where the two 'wog boys' dominate the dancefloor of their local nightclub was the only one that impressed me at all. the only character that was worth watching was 'nathan', played by the castle's stephen curry, his struggle with the opposite sex providing most of the few laughs.a word for this flic is boring. save yourself the time and just watch the tv commercial as the only laughs are shown on it.

... breaker morant and romper stomper . it has also given us watchable films such as bootmen and the odd angry shot . unfortunately for everyone involved in this debacle the wog boy won't be joining appearing in either list .i was looking forward to seeing this movie simply because of the politically incorrect title , so politically incorrect that when it was broadcast on bbc 2 late at night the announcer didn't even mention the movie's name so i was expecting something so offensively anachronistic that my jaw was going to drop in disbelief . it did drop in disbelief , i found myself not being able to believe that the financiers thought this was going to be a major international hit the problem lies with the cast and the script . i do know that australia with its small population doesn't have a large pool of actors so i'll be forgiving for the most part , but this doesn't stop my criticism of nick giannopoulos as steve . for this type of comedy to work you must be impressed with the comic skills of the lead actor and i'm sorry to say but nick g just doesn't have the skills . i'd never heard of him and seen nothing else he's been in so perhaps he's much better at other performances . here however he's just plain irritating , unconvincing and i lost count at the number of times he mugged for the camera . the jokes themselves are very flat and predictable and getting back to the script it seems very under developed , i mean who thought a running gag about a female minster of work who's having it off in the back of a limousine was funny to begin with ? you do get the feeling that someone in the production should have been more honest and said " look mate , this screenplay's not nearly good enough . go and make it more subtle and structured "i've been harsh and harshness has been called for in this review . i gave the movie four out of ten and it would have only got three if it wasn't for the one genuinely funny sequence where steve is watching a current affairs show only for himself flashing up on screen and labelled a " dole blodger " . this shows that the screenwriters were aware of comic timing and social comment . such a pity that they didn't come with a much better written movie

i'm starting to wonder, after reading some of the opinions here, if i watched the same film as the other reviewers but after checking my facts i am forced to the sad conclusion that i have.this witless wannabee screwball comedy has to be one of the the longest 94 minutes i have spent, and one of the most unfunny things i have seen, for ages. now don't get me wrong, i love screwball comedies, but this boring, set-bound drivel falls so far short of the dizzy heights of preston sturges and howards hawks that it doesn't deserve (to mix my metaphors) to be thought of in the same breath as those greats. writer / director charles martin's dialogue is neither witty, subtle or interesting - and there's so much of it. he doesn't know how to end a scene either, with some ruthless cutting, especially of people exiting rooms and saying goodbye to each other, the pace of film would have been lifted and then the fact that the limited number of characters are doing stupid and motiveless things for no other reason than this is supposed to be a comedy would have been a little less obvious. characters in this movie fall in and out of love with each other, and move in and out of apartments, at a moment's notice only to move what little plot there is forward. one moment people are desperately yearning for one person, the next they are getting married to someone else - having wooed and been wooed off screen so we know nothing about it until one of the characters tells us - "oh, they're getting married!" (usually after someone has made a faux-pas or jumped to the wrong conclusion). if we had known that these two characters were in love or supposed to be engaged before hand we, the audience, might have enjoyed the experience of watching someone making a fool of themselves in front of them. as it is the characters just come over looking like selfish, petulant idiots and we have no sympathy for any of them.the sets are limited and the action confined to them in a way that makes the whole thing look like a badly filmed stage play. the only moments of relief from the tedium are keenan wynn who looks like he has wandered in from a different movie and has decided to hang around and be slightly funnier than all the unfunny stuff going on around him.highly avoidable.

since i'd bought the dvd, i watched as much of this as i did out of a sense of obligation to my wallet.the plot has kirk douglas as a successful first novelist who hired laraine day as a secretary, falls in love, and marries her. complications ensue.douglas is usually thought of as an intense actor, given to heavily dramatic roles, sometimes hero, sometimes rat. he's not bad in this thoroughly comic part. the problem is that the part isn't particularly comic and neither is anything else.the plot rambles on. a dozen "quirky" characters come and go -- most prominently keenan wynn as douglas's friend who does nothing but make wry comments. thelma ritter was better at this sort of thing.well, if the plot is weak it could still have been rescued by some sparkle in the dialog but there is none to speak of. some gags are silly. others don't clear that bar. here's what i thought of as an amusing line. douglas has just hired day and wants to get her down to the beach house and seduce her. day is disturbed and remarks that she's never heard of a writer working in a beach house. wynn asks if she liked douglas's previous book, "last year's love." yes, of course she did. "well, most of 'last year's love' was done in the beach house." ha ha.nice cast, including support, but a failed comedy. there have been better sitcoms on television.

ineffectual, molly-coddled, self-pitying, lousy provider jimmy stewart is having a bad marriage to carole lombard. after falling on hard times, he endures a demeaning job, a fault-finding, passive-aggressive, over-bearing live-in mother who is in dire need of an epic smackdown, and an endlessly-crying baby. the movie trowels on failure and squalor to no discernible end. do you want to watch a couple bicker with his mom for ninety minutes? many scenes feature a shrieking baby. the movie fails to elucidate why we would want to endure the mother from hell, or why jimmy stewart can't grow a pair. who wanted to see this? who wanted to see stewart and lombard without laughs or charm?it's absolutely depressing and unendurable.

i decided to watch this movie because i'd not seen carol lombard before in any movie. i'm sorry it had to be this one because, quite frankly, this is a dog  and even with jimmy stewart and charles coburn, both of whom were great actors.the problem with the film is simple: it tries to put too much, too quickly, in to a story about a young lawyer (john manson played by stewart) who marries jane (played by lombard) within an hour of meeting her. what's that cliché? marry in haste, repent at leisure... in short, the story is a series of episodes that show the couples' worsening financial status, their troubles with john's live-in mother, their struggles to pay the bills, john's diminished status at the office, the arrival of their baby son, john jnr (unexpected and causing additional friction at home with mother), the couples' angst about their marriage, the baby's sickness which worsens, thus necessitating an heroic flight by a lone pilot (in a fierce storm) to bring a special serum to save the child, and finally john being accepted as a junior partner at the law firm.how many more clichéd situations could the writers include? maybe mother dying soon after? there wasn't much comedy; the drama was lacklustre, at best; the dialog was painful to hear. only the acting of the four main players was adequate.this was the period at the end of the great depression with the usa coming out of its long downturn  during which many people experienced all of the events portrayed in the movie.so, it made sense for selznick to reaffirm good ol' home spun american values of family, relationships, heroism, perseverance, and initiative  all against the backdrop of the "average" american family. who better to use than jimmy stewart and carol lombard? and, it should be noted that the film was released in early 1939; so, it was planned in 1938  soon after the usa began to get production going for the coming world war ii. hence, this sort of film was a great booster for the general public, at that time, many of who would soon have to join england in war. as many here would know, hollywood and washington formed an uneasy alliance before, during and after the war.however, i'm glad i saw it  as a piece of disguised socio-political propaganda. but, i'll have to see other lombard films to gain a better appreciation of her acting range.as another reviewer noted: see this one just to say that you've seen all of stewart's movies; otherwise, don't bother.

extremely formulaic with cosmic-sized logic holes and a pretense at comedy. aw, poor nyc lawyer! he's just scraping by, and when he gets a reduction in pay he doesn't go out to find another job, though he's one of the most respected lawyers in the area. we see him arguing in court so that others come up and congratulate him on his fiery, winning delivery, but he can't stand up to anyone in his firm. at home, problems are ignored until people storm out of the house.the only character you want to root for is the final maid, who seems an actual human being who uses logic and communication to survive in the world. how laughable that the maid should bring the lawyer and his wife a chicken and wine on new year's eve because she feels sorry for them! (the bit's not played for laughs.)sorry, just too unbelievable and with a **spoiler** pat, everyone-turns-180-degrees ending. how'd they get top-notch stars for this? if i'd been at the studio i'd have sent this one back for a complete rewrite.

carole lombard and james stewart gamely try to inject some life and meaning into this bizarrely constructed film about the tribulations of a newlywed couple. the scenes play as if they were parceled out among various directors, each with a different goal. some are capra-cute, some screwball, some melodramatic, and some surprisingly noir. there's even an extended adventure sequence, when the plot suddenly focuses on a small plane flying through a blizzard. it's hard to say which scenes are the most incongruous, when the film as a whole is so erratic in tone, and the storyline not exactly believable. only worth watching for film students or fans of the actors--some smaller parts, such as judge doolittle and the intrepid pilot, are also very well played.

when i bought 4 dvds for £5.oo in a local shop it should have been warning enough that this movie was not up to the usual standard of david selznick productions. with a cast containing such names as james stewart and carole lombard i was looking forward to a real treat. as many other commentators have said it is an odd mixture of plot and scenes that doesn't quite convince. however, i am so glad that i did view this film as i now have the memorable saying 'never let the seeds stop you from enjoying the watermelon.' to live by. this should sum up everyone's life. pick out those seeds or spit them out or swallow them - and then enjoy the watermelon - life itself.

this film doesn't have a very clear picture of what it is or wants to be. there are some good bits when stewart is on screen and they give him some lines to work with. it works best early on as romantic comedy, but the story keeps heading for more dramatic territory and gets itself lost in the process. by the last fifteen minutes or so, the plot twists are just a series dramatic clichés. the part with the airplane feels like some leftover footage from another film spliced in.the main reason i can think of to watch it is if you want be able to say you've seen all of jimmy stewart's films.

james stewart plays johnny mason, lawyer. carole lombard is jane mason, wife. lucile watson the mother-in-law harriet mason. johnny sees jane and quickly marries her. mother is disappointed. mother lives with them. many troubles are ahead. jane can't cook. can't set the table. can't do many things according to mother. the interaction between daughter-in-law and mother are the highlights of this film. stewart and lombard are married but just don't have any real magic on screen. stewart is stewart. he is good as a timid husband and son but this doesn't carry the film. can baby mason build bridges between jane and harriet? a believable film for those that are married.

this movie is an example of small budget,ineffective star cast,weak storyline and poor entertainment. this kind of movies are made for commercial breaks and not for any entertainment of die-hard fans of bollywood movies. i went to this movie because i thought the earlier one gangster was tolerable so this is also. only thing i appreciate the way new actress put herself in the movie in a very bold way, she very much resembles bollywood actress nandita das. she is good ,sexy and acting well. she definitely go up in her career. our mithunda was all time good at his work .atleast he has some good to the movie. i didn't like imraan for his role must advise him to improve himself now as he has done many movies as new actor and he has been seen as established actor this movie has nothing except the bold scene done by new actress never try this movie

taran adarsh a reputed critic praised such a dubba moviethe film has a weird story wherein a lover sells his love to a brothel cos he wants money to save his mother and then also gets forgived for it lolthe movie is crapthe entire first half has it's focus on romance, comedy which fails to work the twist shocks but the entire second half is a mess and the climax is clichéddirection by aditya datt is bad music is typical himeshemraan does his serious role well but his wardrobe, his way of walking through songs.etc is similar to his previous films geeta bhasra annoys ashmith patel fails to convince this actor was good in murder only so far and then a downhill mithun some screen time and he is okay but his breaking down into a song is forced ranjeet is okay

avoid this film if you are looking for entertainment.it is filled with wannabes trying to be something that they are not and emraan is just wasted in the role of a tour guide who falls for a newcomer who needs to go to acting school. seriously, where to they get these people from? just because you're pretty doesn't mean you can act or should be an actress.asmit patel needs to send an apology letter to everyone who accidentally watches him makes a fool of himself in this poor excuse for a film. he plays an insipid wannabe gangster who drugs girls and forces them to fall in love with him and sells them off to the highest bidder.

fortunately, i haven't seen this film in a movie, big screen, just on a small screen on video. i doubt that i would have been able to sit through the film in a cinema and watch all the violence present in the film. after watching the first 30 minutes, i became both disappointed and curious.disappointed because of the hard to follow story line, the hardly understandable screens, the huge amount of aggression - i still don't know why i had been shown the daesu (main character) pulling out raw the teeth of another person, his beastliness on women, him cutting out his tongue. and also curious, to see what will the film say as a conclusion, what is the ending summary of all this brutality.unfortunately, though the movie was not boring, i didn't get any answer to all these cruelty that i had to watch from the beginning to the end. to my opinion, if you want blood and want to laugh, there is kill bill 1-2, if you want blood with more meaning, you can take any recent war movie, and if you want an eastern movie, there are much better titles out there. afterwards i will take the ratings from the cannes film festival with more precaution, as while oldboy got a lot of praise from the jury, it had not much to say to me and had only 4/10 on my scale.i am hungry to see something beautiful, harmonious, with true feelings and a clear message.

this digital horror film brings us into the micro-budget film genre where the more blood and chicks in distress the better. the story is weak, the acting is respectable and the special effects, well, they're special alright. a quality horror film for the fans that already know what to expect.

jeff leroy wanted to makes fun of scientology so built a horror movie around a cult similar to it. the twist is that instead of frail old l. ron hubbard as the cult leader, there's a centuries old space monster who turns his followers into vampires. our hero is a dirty living college student who is doing research into the occult. his landlord is an attractive blonde who tries to get him to clean up his life with the help of the cult. it doesn't take him long to figure out that she's only after one thing: his blood. "the screaming" was shot very cheaply on video and i just plain ugly. the space monster (which looks like a giant winged cat that looks perpetually mad and has no skin) is alternately a clay-mation miniature and a large scale animatronics puppet, both of which look awful. the acting and writing are both terrible and the director doesn't even try to disguise the fact that this movie was made for nothing. avoid this non-scary, pitiful little excuse.

the screaming is a very low budget horror movie that was shot on video. it features passable acting, poor lighting, a weak story, and some of the worst monster effects i've ever seen. the plot has a college student being pressured to join a cult by his attractive landlord. the cult is a parody of scientology with a book similar to dianetics. this would have been a funny shot at that group were it not for a dumb script and the cheapness of the production. the monster effects look awful and the picture quality makes it feel like you're watching a home video or a public-service announcement. i think anyone who sees this will agree that movies should be shot on film.

bottom-of-the-barrel stinker is so bad it's beyond funny. the "plot" is about an american mercenary, played by reb brown (in the film he's called a "military adviser" but it's not really clear if he's in the american military or not), helping the army of a latin-american country fight guerrillas who winds up joining the guerrillas when the government turns on him, imprisons and tortures him. shannon tweed is a "sports equipment saleswoman" he picks up in a bar who gets caught up in all the intrigue. that description actually makes the movie sound better than it is, because it's really a stinker of almost biblical proportions. how bad is it? well, shannon tweed turns in the movie's most professional acting job. if that isn't an indication of just what a 12th-rate piece of junk this turkey is, nothing is from mismatched sound effects to a music score that sounds like it's from a 1940s "z"-grade horror flick (and may very well be) to the same footage (i.e., armored personnel carriers going down the same jungle trail) reused constantly to some of the most ineptly staged "action" scenes in recent memory, this laugh-a-minute sludgefest has to be seen to be disbelieved. tweed looks bored, brown looks hung over, and by the time this thing is finished--if you can last that long; i couldn't--you'll know just how they feel.although there are a lot of explosions and gunfights, this can't be considered an "action" picture by any stretch of the imagination. it's boring (there's a scene in the back of a truck where everybody just stares at each other for three or four minutes), repetitive (the same "rebels" and "soldiers" being killed over and over), illogical (when a group of rebels is caught in an open field by a government helicopter gunship, instead of breaking for cover they just stand there staring up at it), inept (soldiers and rebels falling "dead" when no gunshots are heard, a gun battle inside a house where combatants standing against walls are machine-gunned but miraculously the walls escape undamaged) predictable (when the "governor" says to offer a reward for brown's capture because "someone" might turn him in, you know exactly who that "someone" will be, and it turns out to be exactly who you thought it was) and just downright stupid (pretty much everything else in the picture). inept, brainless and stupid beyond belief. don't waste your time.

found this film for one dollar ($1.00) and the film was a complete waste of time. reb brown,(mark hardin), played a military adviser in south america and was successful in capturing the leader of rebel soldiers operating out of the dense jungles. however, mark joins the opposite side after some horrible tortures were inflicted or women and men. in one scene as mark is having a drink in a hotel bar, his eyes catch the glimpse of sexy long legs sandra spencer (shannon tweed),"dead sexy",01. mark and sandra have the extreme hots for each other and even make passionate love on some very hard rocks, with no time for the comforts of a bed. this is a horrible film and not worth wasting the time to even look at it.

it's hard to write 10 lines of copy about this so-so film noir. there just isn't a lot to say about it. it is not memorable enough to add to your collection, and i have a considerable amount of noirs.paul henreid plays a tough guy in here. he's not one i would think of to play this kind of role, but he's fine with it. he's a fine actor, anyway.everything, including the cinematography, is okay-but-not memorable. one thing that stood out: the abrupt ending. that was a surprise. it was also a surprise to see this under the heading "hollow triumph." i've never seen the film called that. it's always been called "scar."if you read about a "tense film noir," etc., don't believe it. "tense" is not an accurate adjective for this film.

very odd, this seems like a very average movie to me, if not slightly less. it is brilliantly shot but, together with the performance of r. lee ermey, that's about the only redeeming aspect i found in the movie which consists of two separate parts. the first part covers the basic marine-training which, watching it in 2007, comes off like something i've see a zillion times before in dozens of other movies and series and it's not particularly gripping. after 30 minutes i got the idea and wished they could just get on with it. the drill sergeant is about the only believable character while everyone else seem to be just cardboard cut-outs. the general acting is staggeringly haggard and the screenplay is devoid of anything interesting and consists of little more than the sergeant shouting. the boys make it through their training and end up in vietnam. oh, and the fat weirdo shoots the sergeant (what a surprise..), probably in the mistaken belief that it was actually the scriptwriter. so, one hour passed and nothing worthy of note happened. nothing...then we have the vietnam-part.it opens with a bunk-scene where reporters of stars and stripes are bored and are making small talk to pass the time. at first i thought they were re-enacting some movie scenes from old films, it sounded pretty bad. but no, they were actually muttering their script lines. then the camp is besieged. some 20 vietcong enter the camp through the main gate. too bad for them they are being dropped like flies because they simply walk into several manned gun posts with no means of cover. is that normal behaviour? were the vietnamese all suicidal? if so, how come the us didn't win this war during the first two months of engagement? the rest of the movie continues with even more completely illogical war scenes. furthermore, the whole plot is altogether pointless. none of the characters inspire much sympathy and the story is frankly rather uneventful. it shows little more other than some war-reporters hooking up with a platoon with some guys getting shot because they are disobedient morons and who also seem to think that somehow a gaping hole in a wall will protect you from bullets.what was the message of this movie..that people died in vietnam? that people are animals in war situations? that if you want to dispose of really dumb people, you send them to a war zone? or that somehow in vietnam concrete can actually burn? i'm sorry, but if this movie deserves an 8.3, then apocalypse now deserves a 38.35/10

julie delpy stars in this horrific film about a sadistic relationship between a father and a daughter in france of the 14th century. the film attempts to shatter the romantic chivalry image of the heroic medieval knight, by showing a rather dreary image of the period, defined by psychological dysfunction, and violence. the movie opens with a child, françois, growing up in the shadow of the hundred years' war, told by his father to keep his mother safe and to wait for his return. françois takes action when he discovers his mother with a lover in bed. françois murders him in the name of defending his father's honour. like father like son, françois grows up, and leaves his family, also to go to the same war. this setting is somewhat of an explanation for the events to come, as on his way home, we already notice that something is wrong with françois. the war has not done well with him, he has changed.the daughter, béatrice de cortemart (delpy), awaits her beloved father, to return from captivity of the english. she is pure of heart and she was left to take care of the estate while her father was gone. in her father's absence, béatrice needs to deal with financial difficulties, which strengthens béatrice's hope that her father will return to save her. but, upon his return, she notices that he lost the will to enjoy life, and he tortures and humiliates everything around him, even his own daughter. from this points the film depicts various ways how françois torments his family. starting with humiliating his own son, and ending with the rape of his own daughter, béatrice.setting the film in the middle ages supposed to soften the blow, as the viewer may tell himself, that these kind of violent acts were held in difficult times. and indeed, many films on the topic of incest, such as tim roth's "the war zone (1999)" which are contemporary were more shocking because of that.delpy appears in this film in several daring nude scenes. indeed she appears to be angelic and beautiful.i was annoyed when i saw some animal torture scenes. i believe, and this is not confirmed, that some birds were killed for the making of this film, which really upsets me. the quality of a film drops when real violence is used towards animals. i would hope that this movie will be re-released without those cruelty scenes. those scenes do not contribute much to the film storyline.overall, the movie is too long. the script is problematic. we don't get to see françois and béatrice before the war, we don't really get the answer why is he changed to such extreme. i would have pass on this film, however, i have to mention a few scenes that made this film worth watching:* scenes of a young child being able to murder in cold blood is truly shocking. i saw it first time on "city of god (2002)". here, françois, murders his mother's lover, while his father away at war. excellent scene and very graphic. * the scenes from béatrice being raped by her father till she finds out she is pregnant from him are truly shocking and interesting. the scene after the rape, where delpy burns her cloths and cleans herself. she asks her brother to kick her in the stomach with hopes to have a miscarriage.* the brother humiliation scenes where the father dumps his son's head into the food - humiliating him then ranting about the war. later, dressing his son with women's cloths.the film won the césar (french oscar) for best costume design, i agree, the costumes here really make the film look authentic for the time period. the movie location is château de puivert, a real 12th century castle and a historical monument, located in aude, south-central france. beautiful castle and mountain view, really helps you set into the period of this film. the film also nominated for 3 more césar awards, but they were all snatched to the widely successful french film "au revoir, les enfants" ("goodbye, children", 1998).--- released as "beatrice" in new york city, march 1987. only to be screened in france on november 2007. watched it on yes3 on 3 may 2007, 17:45, at work.

i've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie. bad characters, bad story and bad acting. it would be a love story between a man and a mermaid. really awful.

i usually don't categorize a moving as boring. i am not big on action flicks and my senses do not need to be stimulated during a movie. in fact i enjoy a good rational logical dialogue and story line. unfortunately, this movie has none of those characteristics. diane lane is the only saving grace in this movie and even her beauty cannot save it. terrible overbearing music equals the moronic dialogue and acting. none of the actors actually connect with each other and as a result the movie does not connect with the audience. i guess the scenes where the townspeople are marching somewhere were suppose to add to the story but it seems that they were inserted just to fill space. the scenes appeared choppy and incoherent. there were some nice shots of the ocean and the beach which were beautiful.

with all the potential for a good movie in its gorgeous settings, cast, and cinematography, this film's lacklustre script, leaden pace, and wooden performances produced only a major disappointment. with decent direction, editing, and musical score, this could have been a good movie, perhaps a dark version of blake edward's '10', instead of a weepy version of ron howard's 'splash'.

even sophie marceau's presence and the few (very few) good french gags are unable to save this otherwise slow and boring movie! a disappointment. the story is weak and so is acting. this movie was advertised as the french version of the mummy, but the mummy has at least spectacular and enjoyable effects...

"an evil spirit takes over a girl and diffuses panic in the louvre museum" that's all i think, the summary of the movie and the movie itself ! which i think it's one of the worst french or non french movies ever made in the history of cinema ! nothing good in here except the music (of the credits only !), some tender moments of (sophie marceau), and of course the movie's finale shot.. not because it ends ages of what seemed to be a countless years we had in watching that crap but also for being so perfect as one magical c.g.i work that was too good to be true in here ! by the way i want to change the plot summary to be like this "an evil spirit takes over some cinema artists to make lousy movies".. just like this one for sure.

if you thought this is the french the mummy and if you're hoping for another "vidocq"...well look elsewhere. it does have the same kind of story like the mummy concerning this book of the dead and a soul that needs to find 7 missing pieces that are scattered in the louvre. i found the movie to be slightly entertaining, boring for the most part. the special effects aren't bad, but it's nothing spectacular as i was expecting big explosions and perhaps the eiffel tower crumbling down until i realized that those kind of scenes were in the mummy and this is belhpegor. apparently based on a french cult tv series, belphegor could have been so much better. i voted this film a 4/10 only for the beautiful sophie marceau...she must be almost 40 and she looks breathtaking!

a confusing, senseless script with plot holes the size of the eiffell tower. terrible acting by all involved - no exception! laughable and cheesy dialogue. lame attempts at humor and romance. extremely cheap special effects. all this makes for a giant mess of a film, you'd best avoid.

this cheap, grainy-filmed italian flick is about a couple of inheritors of a manor in the italian countryside who head up to the house to stay, and then find themselves getting killed off by ghosts of people killed in that house.i wasn't impressed by this. it wasn't really that scary, mostly just the way a cheap italian film should be. a girl, her two cousins, and one cousin's girlfriend, head to this huge house for some reason (i couldn't figure out why) and are staying there, cleaning up and checking out the place. characters come in and out of the film, and it's quite boring at points, and the majority of deaths are quite rushed. the girlfriend is hit by a car when fleeing the house after having a dream of her death, and the scene is quite good, but then things get slow again, until a confusing end, when the male cousins are killed together in some weird way, and this weirdo guy (i couldn't figure out who he was during the movie, or maybe i just don't remember) goes after this one girl, attacking her, until finally this other girl kills him off. hate to give away the ending, but oh well. the female cousin decides to stay at the house and watch over it, and they show scenes of her living there years later. the end. you really aren't missing anything, and anyway, you probably won't find this anywhere, so lucky you.

throughout watching "end of days", i got the sense that the film makers were perhaps trying to make this unique to the average hollywood action film. they failed, of course, but you have to give them credit for trying. peter hyams actually tried directing this time, instead of just churning out another flat action film. he attempted to inject atmosphere into the movie by darkening the lights and adding tons of blood. this method can work if used correctly (see "se7en") but here it just feels like a cheap trick to try and scare us. hyams is a decent action director, and offers nothing more here than basic shoot outs and fight scenes, except for the lackluster, sub par f/x end "battle". as a photographer, hyams demonstrates actual ability, displaying some good frame work and movement, but it is nothing above solid work.screenwriter andrew marlowe is the film's greatest enemy. at parts, the script actually shows the makings of good religious thriller, and at times it even shows some quasi-intellectual thought (the temptation scene between arnold and gabriel byrne), but these small pluses are choked out by a river of negatives. generic dialogue/characters, gapping plot holes, and convenient plot points that just happen to point all the characters in the right direction are just a few of the standard hollywood black holes marlowe's screenplay falls into. the shadow of the good movie it could have been faded very quickly.the film surprisingly has a good cast. arnold, still possessing that larger than life attitude, tries to play a depressed, on the edge cop with no more than average results. stick to be the invincible hero arnie, it's what your good at. gabriel byrne is the strong point of the ensemble, bringing a nice air of cynicism to the role of satan. in a villainous role ripe for overacting, byrne restrains himself and it adds a bit more menace to the character. kevin pollak, as normal, is able to bring at least a few chuckles to the movie, but he's done better. also look for a stellar small role from rod steiger.hyams looked like he was trying to separate this from the faceless mass of hollywood action films. he was heading in the right direction, but had neither the script or originality to take it there.4/10

end of days is one of the worst big-budget action movies i've ever seen. muddling direction, meandering script loaded with lame dialogues and gaping plot holes, rapid-fire mtv-style editing and poor acting all the way.that's not to say end of days isn't watchable. the movie kept me interested because i found ah-nuld's latest action flick laughably stupid for being so inept and silly when it comes to logic. without the sense of logic the movie dies quicker, which is why end of days deserved a huge drop of box office reception in its second week after the opening in the u.s.i won't go into the details explaining why end of days violates the law of movie logic, but here are several problems with this movie:(spoiler)after the devil walks out, the restaurant explodes without any trace as to how he did it. no snapping finger, no tampered energy gas to ignite the fire, nothing. how could this happen?arnold and his annoying sidekick kevin pollack somehow magically comes up with the name "christine york" after examining the phrase "christ in new york" carved on a victim's body, runs the database on the computer and, viola, christine york, the only person with the exact name in all of new york city! beyond my suspension of disbelief. how did the characters who have come in contact with arnold's character turn against him later in the movie? i laughed out loud when i recognized the good-stepmother-turned-evil-stepmother is the same actress who played a nanny in william shakespeare's romeo + juliet. her ironic transition from that film to this was absolutely hilarious if you can imagine.all the mindlessly huge explosions and gunfires. what did you expect in the arnold schwarzenegger vehicle?the devil took a man's body comprising of flesh and blood, yet he's invisible to bullets and explosions by healing through that body. logically, this is impossible.as the devil demostrates the illusion in the apartment, arnold's character runs into the solid christmas tree that supposedly is an illusion and *falls on it* physically.the devil is capable of punching the person's brains out and twisting a victim's head 180 degree, yet he could not kill arnold's character as he always intends to.how the devil's object of desire's parents died and why evil new yorkers run after arnold and the object of desire were never explained at all.in the sequence that's a rip-off of speed, arnold and the devil's object of desire manage to escape the subway train wreck by the short distance inside unscathed. this is beyond my comprehension, since the force would be enough to throw arnold and the object of desire around violently and die from fatal wounds seconds after impact.arnold suffers the brutal beating from the mob sanctioned by the devil and put him on the cross to hang against the wall, yet the devil forgot to take the time and opportunity to kill him for convenience's sake.at the beginning of the movie, after the devil took over a man's body, all of a sudden arnold is his bodyguard??? is this a coincidence or just an example of bad editing?arnold's recital of cringe-inducing dialogues in the particularly laughable scenes like "you are a choirboy compared to me!" are the perfect fodder for mst3k, just as eraser did with the classic line "you're the luggage!".the whole theory about 666/1999 is downright ludicrous. so are the pseudo-religious babble about the christian theology involving the end of the world at precisely midnight and the fanatic killers who know the location of the devil's object of desire. (end spoilers)it is highly ironic that end of days uses the scattered profanities abusing the deity while rambling about christian theories. the level of violence in the film is excessive and gruesome, and is therefore unnecessary to serve the plot. the director's indulgence of excess is a factor here. he surely doesn't know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money.hence, end of days is a worthless film with no redeeming value except for campiness -- arnold's worst since hercules in new york.     

these days, asian horror films are among the best in the world, noted for their atmosphere and reflection of contemporary society. this is not one of those films! instead, "the record" is a mediocre slasher movie highly derivative of american movies like "i know what you did last summer" and "scream". the plot is familiar - 5 teenagers accidently commit a terrible crime, but cover it up swearing to secrecy. one year later, they're being stalked by a knife-wielding maniac (with the decidely unscary disguise of a hospital sterile mask and an orange jumpsuit). it doesn't help that the teenagers are a generally unlikable group (this is one of those movies where the killer's motives seem pretty reasonable) and there are numerous stupid plot setups to keep the story going. the direction of the movie is unsubtle, more influenced by mtv than by current asian horror films (like "the ring"). the last third of the movie isn't too bad though, delivering some decent suspense scenes, though there is probably one "twist" too many in the end. 4/10

robert aldrich's brutal, quasi-black comedy "the grissom gang", a reworking of the 1948 british film "no orchids for miss blandish", has 1920s heiress kim darby kidnapped by a pack of clumsy thieves; soon, that gang is dispatched and poor kim is then transferred into the clutches of another crooked bunch--third-rate gangster brothers with sweaty, pasty faces and a mother who looks like buddy ebsen in drag. at first, darby (not very plucky, and not very smart) attempts to escape this drooling brood, but they're onto her. eventually she just gives up trying, and therein lies the trouble with the story. are we in the audience supposed to sympathize with her? is her growing concern for the family half-wit supposed to be heartwarming? these are disgusting, cretinous characters, and i wanted to see as little of them as possible. but since the side-stories (the progress of the cops on the case and another one involving floozy-singer connie stevens) are rather dull, the director has no choice but to keep foisting those sweaty faces on us. pretty soon, nervous darby starts sweating too, although her scene up in the hayloft is sensitively performed and aldrich's climactic moments are thought-provoking, if disorganized. ** from ****

it is truly saddening to see a once-great director such as deodato delivering such a second-rate giallo such as this. this movie was so terrible it effectively put an end to his movie career. the box lies, this is no "erotic thriller", hell during the film's 97 minute running time, charlotte lewis barely shows us one nipple! i thought it would pick up once william burger showed up (in one of his last roles), but his character is killed off rather abruptly and lamely. this movie fails in pretty much every way. claudio simonetti's music is little more than noise, and the plot made very little sense at all. for some reason, lewis is terrorized by ghosts which attack using phones. (?) by the end, the characters all seem to have forgotten the previous 90 minutes of hell they went through, and casually laugh as they sick the evil spirits on someone else, lewis's ex-boyfriend. what?!? this movie did little for me besides anger me.... and bore me half to death. for genuine 80's deodato fun, watch the barbarians or the atlantis interceptors, let this one rot on the video store shelf. argento could make a better giallo than this!

don't be fooled by the plot out-line as it is described on the cover (at least the swedish version). the story on this seems rather interesting, with speculative hints. nothing can be further from the truth. this is the absolute most sad movie experience i've ever had... it is plain and right awful and should not be sold or rented to anyone. if you still think the plot seems intriguing, reflect on this: telephones can move, run and kill people as can also any other electric appliance. it can throw things at you, haunt you and run after you. please do not watch this movie it is a disgrace for the horror genre...

this is only the fourth effort i’ve watched from this director (whom i met and found quite genial at the 2004 venice film festival italian b-movie retrospective) and also, possibly, the worst. as was the case with the bronx executioner (1989), which preceded it, this is a prime example from the tail end of the euro-cult era – prime because it shows the depths to which the previously invigorating style had fallen by this time! here, in fact, we get a plot revolving around – i’m not kidding, folks – a killer phone! pretty but bland charlotte lewis – in her third film after pirates (1986) and the golden child (1986) – is a model who, apparently, has just ended an affair; she keeps expecting her architect lover to call her back but, every time the phone rings, all she gets is static accompanied by voices from the beyond (or some such crap). she befriends a new tenant at her apartment block who, conveniently, knows of an authority on paranormal activity (william berger) – who, hilariously, explains that the negative energy which is unleashed, say, during family arguments can manifest itself via home appliances into a deadly force (i swear i ain’t making this up)! among the highlights...er...lowpoints of the film are: the grumpy bartender from whose dingy place the heroine calls a couple of times (it seems that the chain-of-events can only be broken by having lewis go through her paces again, exterminating angel (1962)-style!), the sheer variety of preposterous-looking phones on display, the apparatus of the heroine’s photographer friend sneaking up on her before the kill, the sarcastic cop who greets lewis on reporting the strange occurrences (“and what’s the toaster up to, i wonder?”), the would-be rapist killed by a barrage of coins shooting out from a telephone booth, and berger’s own bloody demise (with the phone affecting the pacemaker he’s fitted with and causing the doctor’s heart to explode)! the film’s climax is rather confusing and, apparently, finally sees all the ‘lost souls’ inhabiting a flock of doves and flying out the window of the ‘possessed’ office (a lonelyhearts service!). for what it’s worth, the score – by ex-goblin claudio simonetti no less – is effective enough, despite the inclusion of dated heavy-metal numbers on the soundtrack.

well, i was hoping i'd heard wrong about this film as i'm a big fan of ruggero deodato and really didn't want to see him slip up; but unfortunately, this giallo-styled supernatural load of nonsense is just as bad as i'd been lead to believe it would be - and that's pretty terrible! the plot doesn't work at all, as the film attempts to blend murders and a supernatural theme through a telephone and it all feels very forced and silly. furthermore, the plot doesn't make much sense at all, and you have to ask yourself "what's the point" numerous times throughout the movie. the plot focuses on a young woman living in an apartment block and being terrorised by a telephone. the best thing about the movie is undoubtedly the presence of the beautiful english actress charlotte lewis, and unfortunately the good points pretty much stop there. there are a handful of deaths scenes, some of which are gory; but all of which are incredibly stupid, the one that sees someone get killed by coins sticks out especially in that respect. overall, i really can't recommend this to anyone; non-deodato fans are unlikely to impressed, and deodato fans are likely to find the film depressing. avoid!

ring! ring! have-been horror directors hotline, how may we help you? umyeahpronto! i mean hello, my name is rugge err, call me by my initials r.d! okay mr. r.d, what seems to be the problem? well the reviews on my latest movie "dial: help" were all negative and harsh and, frankly, i myself feel like my career has seen better days as well. okay mr. r.d, and why do you suppose that is? well, i gained fame and a well-deserved cult status thanks to my controversial and shocking movie about savage tribes of cannibals devouring a film crew and another one about relentless thugs terrorizing wealthy people in a house at the edge of the park, for which i borrowed the idea from wes craven, but "dial: help" revolves on  err never mind! no no, mr. r.d, go ahead and tell me what the film is about. um, it's about a spiritually possessed phone line stalking a sexy model and killing the people surrounding her. ah, i see. that premise does indeed sound a little silly and not as petrifying as cannibals or rapists, but i suppose there are deeper themes in your film, right? oh yeah, sure um, what do you mean by that? well, isn't the phone line symbolism for another kind of terror? or perhaps it's all just happening in the mind of your female heroine? um, nope it's just about a phone going berserk and murdering people with the cord, vibrations, electricity or even ordinary coins. interesting, mr. r.d, but how do you explain all this supernatural stuff to the viewer at the end of the movie? you see, i figured the slowly unraveling phone-mystery plot wouldn't be that important or relevant, so i just concentrated on processing all possible phone-gimmicks i could think of. phone gimmicks? what do you mean? you know, like wind blowing through the horn, mind-penetrating dial tones, and turn-tables catapulting into the air! very original, mr. r.d, but not exactly horrific and as an experienced director you must know that, in the end, people expect a reasonable clarification of all these events. oh, but there is! it all has to do with negative and unreleased energy, if i remember correctly! it's all a bit fuzzy, i admit. hmm i see. oh well, as they always say, a good motion picture relies on more elements than just the story. did you at least process some of your regular trademarks into the film, so that your fans at least recognize your style? i tried! lord knows i tried, but the murders and bloodshed are simply not shocking anyone! that's a pity indeed, mr. r.d, but what about sex? everyone likes a good portion of sleaze and nudity in their horror films and you said yourself the film centered on a sexy fashion model in peril! yes, but  but what, mr. r.d? well, to tell you the truth, we kind of promoted "dial: help" as an erotic thriller with revealing shots of charlotte lewis on the cover, but in reality there's no sex in the film and charlotte even refused to go topless. mr. r.d! now i'm really disappointed, that's just shamelessly ripping people off and lure them with false promises! i know, i know, and i'm ashamed, but i just wanted everybody to rent "dial: help" and love it! well, to round up i can comfort you by saying that every major director is entitled to a few erroneous decisions without it affecting his/her career immediately, but be more cautious next time and do some research first, okay mr. r.d? i will; thank you! you're welcome. tell me, have you got any ideas for upcoming movies already? yeah, as a matter a fact, i do! i was thinking about making a giallo with a murderous washing machine! doesn't that sound fascinating? hello? hello?

i admit, i was taken in by the provocative stills of charlotte lewis from this film, as well as a comment on the imdb message board devoted to her, calling this picture a "great underrated film". and so i got, with great difficulty, my own copy of "dial help".what a waste.nothing but a cheaply-made blood and gore movie with a ridiculous premise which i'm not even going to repeat, with several telegraphed sequences (for instance, when we see lewis lovingly feeding her fish, we know right away what's going to happen to them later). not even lewis, with her beautiful raven hair, large and luminous brown eyes, full and pouty lips, and stunning figure, can save this film. lewis fans would be better off with "bare essentials", "sketch artist", or even "golden child".

a stunningly beautiful charlotte lewis stars as a woman who is terrorized by a ghosts who torment her on the phone.driven to the edge in terror charlotte is forced to confront this chilling mystery in order to save her sanity and her life.i can't believe that ruggero deodato,the director behind "ultimo mondo cannibale","cannibal holocaust" and "house on the edge of the park" directed this absurd piece of trash.admittedly the music by goblin front man claudio simonetti is pretty good,but the story is painfully stupid.the script by franco ferrini is ridiculous and it makes no sense,the acting is bad and there is absolutely no suspense.the scene in which a prospective rapist of charlotte lewis is killed by coins ejected from a subway telephone is more than laughable.don't waste your time with this piece of crap.there are far better italian horror movies out there!

the most disturbing thing about this film is not that it's a load of hogwash (the cpusa was never really as much an espionage threat as the movie makes out). the troubling aspect is the way that it whitewashes the wholly unsavory tactics of the fbi and the unamerican activities committee. secret informants, gossip turned into accusations, warrantless searches - these are the kind of things secret police thugs like the kgb did, and presumably, what the good patriotic americans were fighting. yet the fbi did them and didn't bat an eye. that's the only realistic part of this movie, and they present it with no sense of shame at all. add to this undermining the constitution itself by having only communists invoke the bill of rights. the film also makes thinly veiled accusations that the black civil rights movement was communist-inspired, another pack of lies. it's extremely difficult in this day to excuse such outrageous propaganda, even understanding the paranoia of the times, when one realizes how damaging it was to real people then.

matt cvetic is a loyal communist in a pittsburgh steel mill who works to recruit workers into the party, even though this isolates himself from his son, family, and neighbors. what makes this even more difficult is that cvetic is actually an fbi agent posing as a communist in order to obtain information about party activities. the party is trying to create a strike at the mill, whereby the pro-strike movement will lead the workers into a wave of propaganda. cvetic also has to contend with beautiful eve merrick, a party member and teacher at his son's school who finds the fact that cvetic is a double agent. when eve learns the ugly truth about the party's real motives, the reds decide she must be liquidated and cvetic must aid her without endangering himself. the film should have plenty of suspense and double crossing but there is very little in this film but (by today's standards) very cheesy propaganda and little action or thrills. lovejoy is very good in the main role, but even he and the rest of the cast seem listless. few surprises here and how did this film receive a oscar nod for best documentary? rating, 4.

there are so very few films where just the title tells you all you need to know about the film. such a film is i was a communist for the fbi. another example would be i married a monster from outer space.the really interesting thing about this film is how in heaven's name did this get nominated for an oscar in the documentary category? it is not a documentary in any sense of the word, it's not even in that hybrid category of docudrama. it's just a rather exploitive film about the work of an fbi undercover agent named matt cvetic who infiltrated the communist party in pittsburgh and got active in trying to take over the steelworker's union for the communists and reporting on said activities to his handlers in the fbi.a documentary of that work might have been interesting, but what we got was a film to fit those paranoid times. i found it fascinating that when cvetic finally broke his cover it was to the house un-american activities committee rather than the trial in new york of the communist party leaders. there was a moment in the film where head communist james millican tells his followers to start spreading the word that the house un american activities committee was composed of a bunch of right wing yahoos looking to get their names in front of the camera. now what could have given him that idea? anyway just connect the dots and no doubt the word their came from j. edgar hoover trying to give some credence to huac by having an effective undercover come out there rather than at an actual trial. little thing there called cross examination.warner brothers who produced i was a communist for the fbi later produced big jim mclain which starred john wayne about a huac investigator in hawaii. huac did grab on to credit for the work done by the honolulu pd in breaking up a communist spy ring there among the dockworkers. but at least in john wayne's film nobody claimed it was a documentary.frank lovejoy is in the title role as cvetic and his fbi handlers are richard webb and philip carey. dorothy hart plays a pittsburgh school teacher who says that there are 30 or so like here in that school system indoctrinating the young among whom is ron hagerthy, lovejoy's son. she has a change of heart about the communists and lovejoy has to save her from a homicidal fate planned by his superiors. ironically hart left the movies and went to work for all places, the united nations which as we know has been accused often of being a communist nest in the usa.over half a century later and we really have very few objective works on film or in print about the communist party of the usa. they were in fact a very active bunch in the labor movement. the real heroes in stopping them were labor organizers like walter reuther in the uaw or david dubinsky in the ilgwu. but since they were people of the left they just don't have the following on the right to be suitable propaganda material.anyway i was a communist for the fbi is an exploitive work based on a real life character and a testament to those paranoid times.

the thesis of father brown is that a good dose of roman catholicism will solve all of life's problems. a little proselytizing i don't mind, but this gets a bit ridiculous at times.some fine actors have played father brown over the years, kenneth more and barnard hughes are two good examples. alec guinness plays him in this film and does all right by him, but you didn't see any great demand for future father brown films.i suppose if you are a committed roman catholic it all makes perfectly good sense. it's far more important to catch the thief and convert him to your religion than see he's brought to justice. but that's what were asked to accept here. in fact there is a preliminary story before the main action of the film. guinness in clerical garb is caught trying to put back stolen articles that one of his parishioners sidney james had heisted during a robbery.that's the story he gives the local cops and of course this is something that james has confided in him so he can't break the confessional. now on to bigger game. master thief flambeau, played by peter finch has stolen a cross that is entrusted to father brown and was said to belong to st. augustine back in the day. but father brown is more interested in getting flambeau to go back to his faith than seeing him brought to justice. so he misleads the cops so he can accomplish his mission.i'm sorry but this whole thing was just too much for me to swallow. father brown i'd hate to say it was guilty of obstruction and ought to have been arrested. and he was under no obligation not to reveal anything he knew about flambeau, the man had not come to him as a penitent seeking absolution and spiritual advice.author g.k. chesterton, a very noted catholic lay person in his day, finds all this very reasonable. carried to his logical conclusion we should replace all police forces with an army of priests.guinness borrows from his own reverend ascoyne d'ascoyne from kind hearts and coronets and from barry fitzgerald in going my way to create father brown. granted though brown is a lot shrewder than the other two. there's also a bit of colonel nicholson in this portrayal. in the bridge on the river kwai, guinness also was playing a character who's rather weird interpretation of the rules caused him to lose sight of what was important in the situation nicholson was in. father brown's an entertaining fellow when he's solving mysteries and making the authorities look foolish. we've enjoyed brother cadfael do it in a medieval setting and american audiences liked father dowling played by tom bosley a few years back. this film should have stuck to being entertaining.

on the pure theatrical side, last stand was great, as the reenactments and soundtrack are very entertaining, but there are better accounts of this battle found elsewhere that, while not as long or as flashy, are far more historically comprehensive.certain little details, such as the misuse of the word "hoplon" for the greek hoplite shield and the mispronounciations of various names and words, really ate at me.my guess would be, that because "last stand of the 300" was aired the eve of the theatrical release of "300", the history channel was only trying to ride the coattails of the movie's hype.if you're looking for a depiction that's historically accurate in all respects possible, you'd have better luck elsewhere.

fred astaire is reteamed with rita hayworth one year after their big hit for columbia, "you'll never get rich". that was the movie which put hayworth on the hollywood map, yet her performance in this wan romantic musical hardly gives a suggestion why she was so suddenly popular. down buenos aires way, a tyrannical hotel owner demands that his four daughters marry in order of age; one may think film takes place in the 18th century, but no, it's modern-day 1942. astaire is an ex-hoofer-turned-gambler who goes back to dancing to earn some money, getting mixed up in impersonating a letter-writing admirer to hayworth's stone-cold society beauty. fred gazes at rita with a brotherly smile, but she's so mannequin-like (lip-synching to her songs like a wide-eyed wind-up doll) that all romantic sparks quickly sputter. they do dance together quite comfortably, however, and the jerome kern score is unmemorable but not too bad. ** from ****

the price of a dream - and some dreams can be "too" expensive.only having viewed the english-translated version, it is perhaps the reason for a low rating from this viewer.it made the overall film poorer than the story material hinted at......and other comments seem to suggest the subtitled version would be better.but some plot elements remained unexplained, leaving an unfinished feel.it also leaves the thought "is there a series to follow?".a pity there was no more (at this stage at least, anyway).

how do i describe the horrors?!!! first, some points: first, this review should be taken with a grain of salt -- i saw this over 20 years ago, when i was a boy, at the museum of modern art in new york city.secondly, i am giving away some scenes and plot points. however, it does not have much of a plot.finally, i don't enjoy these type of art films anyway.this film was directed by proto-auteur luis bunuel. he was a surrealist and dadaist. these were modernist themes or movements popular critically in the 1920's and early 1930's. surealism was the school of art that made things hyper-real, yet often had freudian symbolism. dadaism is based on what is supposedly the first word made by an infant -- dada, or father.made in black and white, it was also made by a band of communists (or as they preferred the term, socialists). bunuel and his group of fellow film-makers and artistes had been working on a number of symbolic ideas and issues in spain and france between the world wars.dadaism and surrealism influenced a lot of artists -- the police (doo doo doo da), poet arthur rambaud, edvard munch (the scream), rene magritte (floating hats in space), salvador dali (melting clocks), and even hitchcock (psycho). no norman rockwell.here's what i recall most about this film: a girl meets up with a cow; her eye gets slashed by a razor; clownish men cavort in a meadow. there is not, as i said, much of a plot, but then again, that must be the point.this was attacked as porn back then, and would be again today. one of the trade-marks of surrealism is a significant anti-feminism.

ok, it's a piece of historical film making that caused an uproar, shocked people, and was banned. i'll give it that, which is why i gave it a 3 rather than a 1. it may have been ahead of the times, but it's certainly way behind the times now. i am a big fan of salvador dali and i loved un chien andalou. that short was captivating with one creative scene after another. l'age d'or was way too long and dull - just a self-indulgent piece of pompous film making created simply as a feeble attempt to try to out-do un chien andalou by creating a full- length movie (and shamelessly leverage dali's name and fame even though he had little to do with it). total junk except for a (very) few shots of "shocking scenes" separated by long stretches of boring non-action. a waste of time and money. both of my thumbs are down, way down. it'll go onto my shelf never to be watched again.

when something can be anything you want it to be or mean, it's bound to register with someone as being rather special. but just as the shape of a cloud in the sky may appear to one of us or remind us of a battleship, and to another of his aunt's rear, and yet to another absolutely nothing other than a cloud, this does not make this cloud meaningful except for the viewers' interpretation. anyone who might find throwing a stuffed giraffe out of a window brilliant, or worthwhile for that matter, without relating it in some context, is possibly merely trying to impress us with his or her intellectuality.submitting to this movie as the dreams of a madman does quite nicely, especially since there is no standard or expectation for what said dreams would be like, and even if we were mad ourselves, this would hardly give us sane reference points for comparison. a love affair with this movie entails the same risk as seriously interpreting nostradamus. whatever real meaning was being conveyed at the time might be buried in the private jokes, musings, or provincial minutiae of its day, and to a select few radical intellectuals at that! i did spot a bit of an agenda even with my limited capacity though.the movie is definitely anti-fascist and to some extent anti-italian. i noted that although the years 1929-30 were years of great public works and urban renewal in italy, any indication of this seemed avoided. furthermore, (avant-guarde academic spinners take note of this for your next class) the very short cropped haired man with the mustache in the party segment near the end is a caricature of victor emmanuel iii and his tall female companion none other than queen helen, formerly princess of montenegro. without an understanding of potential historical relevance, even the apparent irrelevance is beyond the competence of academic or other intellectual poseurs who would bask in irrelevance to impress us.i gladly add my own paint buckets to the defacement of this cinematic joke. but in an adaptation of the famous mot by the little boy; the movie really has no face (to deface). paint would help it burn though.

the man (gaston modot) and the young girl (lya lys) go through the film consumed by passion for each other. they long to be together but their moments together are constantly interrupted. the film is strewn together with imagery and comes to a halt after an hour.........do the lovers find happiness....?..the film starts interestingly with footage of scorpions but you soon realize that its all a pretentious piece of nonsense. it's made as a silent film with occasional dialogue and it has a non-stop soundtrack playing that at one point is so irritating that you will turn the sound down and want to watch it as a silent film. the continuous drum rolls must have driven cinema audiences mad. there are some genuinely funny moments, eg, when the man kicks a dog and when he knocks over a blind man. unfortunately, this humour is carried out in the name of art so its just pseudo nonsense. the film is crap.

i'm a big fan of surrealist art, but this film by bunuel (with some ideas from dali) left me cold. bunuel had a life-long grudge against the catholic church and delighted in trying to offend catholics in fairly silly ways. this is one of the silliest; almost like what you'd expect from a smart-aleck 18-year-old in film class. the last few minutes of the movie, which have nothing to do with anything else, are a final nose-thumbing at religion.if you read the "scholars" regarding this slow-paced, occasionally amusing film, it's all about how the church and society are guilty of sexual repression. if that is indeed the point, then bunuel expresses it in the most roundabout fashion possible. the central male character is a nasty brute who loves kicking dogs and knocking blind men down in the street, and who mentally turns billboard ads into strange sexual fantasies. is this behavior the church's fault (for interrupting his lovemaking), or is he just a jerk? i vote for the latter. i think bunuel must have had a lot of personal hangups and chose the catholics as the ones to blame.there are a few moments where you might cry, "aha! surrealism!": a cow in a bed, a giraffe falling out a window (a poor model), a man shredding a feather pillow, a woman flushing a toilet while we watch pictures of seething lava (or a mud pit...hard to tell in b/w). the rest is forgettable self-indulgence. unfortunately, bunuel was still chasing the same bogey-men through the rest of his career (viridiana, discreet charm...). if you're interested in seeing surrealism on the screen, check out jean cocteau's early work.

a man kicks a dog 2' in the air.a woman kicks a cow out of her bed.a man kicks a violin down the sidewalk.a woman sucks on a statue's toe for 15 seconds.a man kicks a blind man in the stomach.jesus rapes a young girl.there you have it. i just saved you an hour of your life. surely there are those to whom this "shocking vanguard of cinematic expression" would appeal. but i found it no different from the puerile, disconnected videos i used to shoot with my friends in the 9th grade. except we never had a real cow.having heard endless sermons from beard-stroking art connaisseurs of how this is such an important film, i thought it would be worth my time. make no mistake, this is crap. if i hear one more person call buñuel the "father of cinematic surrealism", i think i'm going to punch someone. if anything, he issued a major step backward from the surrealist beginnings pioneered by his seniors fritz lang (metropolis), f.w. murnau (faust) and robert weine (caligari) 10 years earlier. this made a joke out of the whole thing, as if buñuel didn't have the confidence to truly embrace the art sans sarcasm, sans l'absurdité. it would take buñuel another 40 years before he would refine his style into something admirable. skip the early stuff and hop straight to 1970 if you want to be more impressed by his work.i'm sure he would agree. in 1977, buñuel himself stated that he would happily burn all the prints of his old movies. in this case i would be happy to pour the lighter fluid.

some movies you'll watch because they touch your soul or challenge you in ways that grow.some you'll watch because you want to be exposed to adventure or shock outside your experience; these won't directly feed you, but they'll help you situate yourself in a larger world than you otherwise would have. and after all, the hard parts of life are in what you choose not to accept.and then there are movies that do neither of these things, that you will watch out of obligation, or because you have a need for historical context. these are pretty worthless experiences in terms of building a life.the problem is of course that often you don't know which of the three a film will be, going in. you might get some indication from people you trust, but because a life in film is so personal, you really won't know until you go on the blind date.for me, this was pretty worthless. yes, yes, i know for many bunuel is the epitome of the sublime and rich. and you should know (if you don't) that among my greatest film experiences are some very strange films, very strange indeed.it isn't that this isn't cinematic, or symbolically deep, or apolitically/politically friendly to the way i think. its how it gets there that is off base. its the deviance from real deviance that annoys me.part of the problem is that this is successful alternative art, which means that it is successful commercial art. which in turn means that it can be simply explained and the explanation is not only widely acceptable but simply coded in shorthand. surely all this is true.when the term "surreal" is used, generally it is used incorrectly to denote any film image or world that differs from reality or seems strange. but when it is used correctly, meaning according to consensus theory, it always revolves around bunuel, and in particular this film and the one he genuinely did with dali. so because they invented surreal cinema, they define and control the term. that by itself chafes me, and i have my own alternative definition that doesn't come from their philosophy.its because the philosophy is wholly contrary. it isn't a philosophy at all but a rejection of philosophy, an anti-order. its packaged anarchy, carefully selecting the things that they use and the things they oppose without clearly differentiating them.so okay: against linearity, against narrative, against history, against religion (an easy one), against deliberate love. but for an illinear linear narrative, for establishing its own history (celebrated by countless film school professors; what else can they do?); for a sort of transcendent "accidental" love.it is its own enemy. if there were a bunuel alive today as he sold his image, the first thing he would do is attack the church or the surreal.my regular readers know that in nearly all matters cinematic, i cleave to the spanish and avoid the french. but in the matter of the surreal, i'd like to you consider the reverse: get your surrealism from alfred jarry, not bunuel.ted's evaluation -- 2 of 3: has some interesting elements.

now, i love italian horror films. the cheesier they are, the better. however, this is not cheesy italian. this is week-old spaghetti sauce with rotting meatballs. it is amateur hour on every level. there is no suspense, no horror, with just a few drops of blood scattered around to remind you that you are in fact watching a horror film. the "special effects" consist of the lights changing to red whenever the ghost (or whatever it was supposed to be) is around, and a string pulling bed sheets up and down. oooh, can you feel the chills? the dvd quality is that of a vhs transfer (which actually helps the film more than hurts it). the dubbing is below even the lowest "bad italian movie" standards and i gave it one star just because the dialogue is so hilarious! and what do we discover when she finally does look in the attic (in a scene that is daytime one minute and night the next)...well, i won't spoil it for anyone who really wants to see, but let's just say that it isn't very "novel"!

i share the same opinion regarding underworld as the previous comment.i sat through the 1.5 hours of this movie wondering what this story was all about and more importantly why the author and/or director had made certain decisions for the plot. on the whole i found the movie to be unbalanced, consisting of strange sub-plots which (imho) actually had nothing to do with the movie. furthermore, when writing a thriller i'd say you want your viewers to wonder about the story and not about the way the story is filmed...

this movie is an obvious rip-off of underworld usa starring cliff robertson. you owe it to yourself to invest a couple of hours and watch the original. i found this one to be disjointed and hard to follow, with a lot of scenes that didn't make much sense. i'm not opposed to violence in movies but this whole thing seemed to be nothing more than an excuse to blow away one person after another, many of whom were only marginally connected with the storyline. with everyone else getting killed, all through the movie i wondered why frank didn't just blow johnny's brains out. he certainly could have and johnny sure didn't act like someone that could be trusted. another thing that bothers me is the sex scenes; why do these people have sex with their clothes on? is that supposed to turn us on? surely they didn't think they had a shot at a pg rating. nothing in this movie seemed to play out naturally. as if one were watching people in real life, instead it was done in a heavy-handed and shallow manner.

this movie was in my opinion very ignorant! there is only foolishness as the motivation of the caracters. the police procedure was unrealistic. the caracters generated no sympathy from me,the story must have been written as the movie was filmed. unless you like police bashing stories don`t waste your time.

what are forest whitaker and clifton collins jr. doing in this? light it up is a ridiculously melodramatic piece on problems in low income area schools. while the topic is one that needs to be addressed, the film uses every cliche in the genre and comes off as a textbook popcorn flick. the characters are cutouts from the inner city version of the breakfast club or even the faculty. watch this with your children when they turn 13 or 14. with them, it could be an outlet for a lesson on current social problems. for anyone older, it will be nothing more than something to watch and spit on at 4 in the morning, as i did recently on bravo. matter of fact, what was this doing on bravo?

i found this movie to be preachy and unrealistic. it tries to be a movie showing kids fighting against the system, but it doesn't even present a positive solution. i guess i didn't feel really for the kids. i totally can understand what their gripes were and i know how poor the state of schools are, but i found their solution and the way the outside dealt with it to be a big bunch of phooey. if this comes on tv, don't waste your time. watch short circuit again for the 235th time.

this movie was completely stale and uninspired. the central premise of this movie was basically a bunch of stereotypical black people sitting around a barbershop exchanging painfully unfunny repartee. i did not laugh one time during the entire movie. i could have sat in any barbershop in america and have heard this banal banter, and maybe have even come out with a decent haircut. i cannot understand why this mess got any favourable reviews, much less why so many people have wasted money on this. none of the characters here were funny or worth caring about. i really didn't care whether the rival barbershop across the street would cause nappy cutz to go out of business. don't waste your money on this one, folks, as that is the only way to get hollywood to stop churning out these shambolic pieces of rubbish. 1* out of 5

barbershop 2: back in business wasn't as good as it's original but was just as funny. the movie itself lacked little things which the original held which made it much more enjoyable. back in business seemed to be just another worthless sequel made to bring in money with a very thin plot. cedric the entertainer's terrible excuses for flashbacks ruined the movie and seemed to be a bad way to try and get the audience to adapt more with the character. overall barbershop 2: back in business was a sequel not needed, without the originals charm, soul & spark.

the first movie of this series was well written and original. this show drags on, poorly written gags, boring flashbacks, not the comedy that i expected. even the young folks found it boring. there are certainly bright moments, historical elements and some good acting, but overall i can only recommend this for dvd/tape at home.

the plot involves a new, hipper franchise barbershop that is moving across the street from calvin's barbershop. so, he feels like he has to change and improve his shop by getting newer stuff and such. sounds real exciting huh. as for the rest of the film, a lot of it involves the same material from the first film. the people that work at calvin's stand around, talk loud, and mouth off to each other and the customers. once again cedric the entertainer was mildly funny, but it is more like he's doing a stand-up routine than anything to do with the movie. and calvin is faced with another moral issue involving taking a large sum of money. he's already shown that he will do the right thing in the end.final verdict: nothing new. i don't recommend it unless you thought the first barbershop was the best thing since sliced bread.

this movie came as a huge disappointment. the anime series ended with a relatively stupid plot twist and the rushed introduction of a pretty lame villain, but i expected shamballa to tie up all the loose ends. unfortunately, it didn't. it added more plot holes than it resolved, and confused more than it clarified. the animation and voice acting were great, but with an idiotic plot, dull setting (most of the movie doesn't even take place in dull wwii earth rather than the alchemy world), and disappointing ending (ed is useless for the rest of his days in a world with no alchemy, and he ditches winry?), it was altogether pretty lackluster. do yourself a favor-- disregard the last half of the anime as well as this movie, and read the manga.

first off, i am critical of this movie because i really had high hopes and instead, this movie sucked.*possible spoilers* (if you haven't seen the tv series) where to begin??? well, let's start at the quality. the movie was barely better than the original tv series and the two fight scenes were very nicely crafted. however the cgi was horrid.then there is the plot holes and questions that still remain after the whole movie is all said and done. this movie does not close off as a successful conclusion to a very broad universe known as fma and only returns to expand the universe more before leaving us with nothing but our imaginations to decipher what would happen in the future.and then there is the stories biggest fault. adding wwii and hitler... why ?? the series was perfect... and didn't need hitler. it didn't even need germany.overall the entire movie was sorely lacing in what a true fma movie could have been and if i were the directors, i'd scrap cos and make a new, more "ending", ending.

conquerer of shamballa shows what happens when creators of an anime fail to understand what their fans want. i as a fan did not want a 1920's evil nazi movie. what i would have liked to see is a real final showdown between ed and dante, as we don't really know what became of her. i also would have liked to get ed back to his world much sooner and have him stay there, to finally get a chance to be normal. you know, raise a family with a certain blonde mechanic, that sort of thing. no, instead i got a convoluted plot involving nazi mystics, fritz lang and about ten minutes of al, a joke of a cameo by roy mustang and only one armstrong joke, one short joke and no winry hitting ed with a wrench. above all, it just didn't feel like fullmetal alchemist to me.

this is a tedious movie. the real villains are the clunky adaptation (it's embarrassingly easy to tell that the source material was a novel) and witless screenplay.on the credit side, considering the budget was tight due to wartime austerity, the look of the film isn't at all bad. and the performances are, by and large, ok, except for phyllis calvert, who is terrific - a miracle considering the potential for winsomeness, a pit into which she most definitely does not fall. ms calvert, with a lot less to go on, is as accomplished as olivia de havilland in gone with the wind.the one absolutely unbearable aspect of the man in grey is the dreadfully conceived depiction of a black serving boy. no matter that he's meant to be a sympathetic character. played badly by a white boy in black-face make-up, it is impossible to by-pass this example of condescending racism.grim.

detective dave robicheaux is trying to link the murder of a local hooker to new orleans mobster julie balboni. but during his investigation robicheaux is led into a series of surreal encounters with a troop of confederate soldiers??, what a awful plot and it was worser than i had expected. it was real slow and had minimal skill in the acting i could not watch through it it was waste of my time. another flop, i would give it under 1 if i could please people don't waste your time its 1:42m of wast-full time. actor elrod sykes and his girlfriend driving under the influence. as dave takes elod to the station the actor tells dave he found some skeletal remains while on the set of a movie he is filming

a group of heirs to a mysterious old mansion find out that they have to live in it as part of a clause in the will or be disinherited, but they soon find out of its history of everybody whom had lived there before them having either died in weird accidents or having had killed each other.you've seen it all before, and this one is too low-budget and slow paced to be scary, and doesn't have any real surprises in the climax. no special effects or gore to speak of, in fact the only really amusing thing about the whole film is the quality of the english dubbing, which at times is as bad as a cheap martial arts movie.3 out of 10, pretty low in the pecking order of 80's haunted house movies.

it's boring.it's slow.where are the nasty and brutal murders? where is the tension that is supposed to scare us? this is like watching sesame street without the funny characters of ernie and bert or grover.it's really lame.maybe it was the writing...maybe the direction...maybe the acting, maybe the editing, maybe the cinematography, maybe the special effects, maybe the makeup.maybe all of the above brought this to something barely able to keep your eyes focused on.i wanted to get scared...not bored.this didn't scare me...it didn't even interest me...i had more fun watching the time on the microwave instead of watching this film.don't bother to buy it..and if you see it on television by some freak chance, there is no need to tuck the kids asleep.

it's hard to believe that a movie this bad could actually be released. the dialog was unnatural. especially poor was the portrayal of the relationship between the boy and his future step-father. i guess you could say that they succeeded in producing awkward dialog, but what was said seemed false and artificial. the suspense just wasn't there. the music was about as bad as it gets. the only reason i watched this movie was because i live in the death valley area and was curious about what locations would show up on the screen. fortunately the movie was on tv and so i didn't waste any money renting this sorry excuse for a film! i honestly believe that most amateurs could put together a more captivating plot than was presented here. it's too bad that the time of an entire film crew was wasted on such trash! i guess the only positive thing i can say about the movie is that some of the scenery was good.

nice movie and nicholle tom does a fantastic job playing the "guy in the girl's body", she really does it well.a sort of teen version of many other movies, but well done.well casted, from "matt" to "matt2".

i fail to understand why anyone would allow a sub-par director to put drivel like this onto celluloid. this movie has already been made at least two other times that were better than this ("here comes mr. jordan" - 1941, and "heaven can wait" - 1978). the only saving factor for figure skating fans might have been some nice ice skating done by a professional cast of skaters, but this just does not happen. the closest thing the audience sees to good skating is when tara lipinski's character takes a turn on the ice for a just a moment. others like nancy kerrigan and elvis stojko are hidden in the background and do not do any figure skating at all. there is not much real emotion shown, and there is not really any reason to tune in to this obviously made-for-tv movie. my advice: rent the original.

!!! spoiler alert!!!the point is, though, that i didn't think this film had an ending to spoil... i only started watching it in the middle, after matt had gotten into sarah's body, but then i became fascinated by the bizarreness of the plot, even for a channel 5 movie... and couldn't possibly see how matt wld end up happy. what about his fiancee? at one stage looked like he was gonna get with his best friend, surely icky and wrong... and then the whole 'oggi oggi oggi' thing does not work as a touching buddy-buddy catchphrase, tis just ridiculous... so was going 'surely he can't just come back to life? and yet how can he live as a woman?' and then the film just got over that by ending and not explaining anything at all!!!!! what's that about??? i was so cross, wasted a whole hour of my life for no reason at all!!! :) but was one of the funniest films i've ever seen, so, swings and roundabouts

this film has possibly, the worst title for a stooge short ever dreamed up. somewhat fitting, given the actual fifteen minute content.i can do without any of the "shemp a.d." stuff, but i will admit to having a few lol moments from the two-man comedy offered by moe and larry in some of the new footage (and kudos to those guys for trying to give it their all, considering the position they were forced into in even making these dogs).another bright spot to this and the last a.d. debacle "commotion on the ocean" is the decided lack of screen time for joe palma and the back of his head. no attempts to have him speak or flap his arms like a chicken(see "hot stuff"), may be worth an extra rating point.2/10

this series, made for televisión española (tve) is basically a series of chapters in the life of an ordinary family in 1968, primarily as seen through the eyes of the youngest son.based on a background of historical events, such as the may 1968 student uprising in france, the decaying franco regime, the war in viet-nam, the rise of imperialism, and others specifically related to spanish life at that particular moment, one might regard this series as a simple compilation of characteristic foibles which make themselves so apparent in this kind of entertainment.generally treated in a lightweight vein though not lacking in certain moments which might be called dramatic, the series would seem to be aimed at people of around fifty who can rember those times, as, it should be stated, anyone younger either chooses to ignore such happenings or is busily occupied in other things.the best thing that can be said of this series is ana duato's rôle as mother of three children: she plays the part of the total housewife of the times really well, manifesting that peculiar spanish penchant, especially noticeable among women, of letting all her thinking and her doings be carried forward by the impetus of her heart, without any resorting to the use of the brain. as we say in spain, common sense is one of the least common senses. imanol arias offers very little, apart from not being his usual stereotyped hard policeman as in other television series. indeed, as an actor, he should not be trusted in anything which is not a tv series. his resources are too limited; however, his part as father of the working-class household is not at all bad.not really recommendable for other audiences, even spanish-speakers in latin america: the themes are all too parochially related to a specific spot in contemporary spanish history, such that if the viewer was not living here at that time he will miss most of the references. it is even probable that certain situations which cause a few spanish smiles would not mean anything to other viewers.

you thought after "traumschiff surprise" that german comedy can't get worse? it can. this comedy is yet another attempt at perpetuating stereotypes of gay men masked as a nice comedy. the initial concept (openly gay men in soccer sports) would have been a great opportunity to erase some stereotypes, but... the real intended message of the movie seems to be in what way gay men are oh-so-different from straight men. absolutely silly, of course. even gay sex is treated as being of less value than straight sex. this movie only tries to serve straight audiences wanting to laugh about stereotypical gay men. well, don't waste your time on german comedy movies!

when i went to see this movie it was already a forced choice, as my original intent was sold out. what ensuited then was sheer terror, this movie is so bad i could hardly bear it. the story is not worth mention, a gay goalkeeper forms a gay soccer team to play against his old straight team who - on discovering his sexual orientation - gave him a hard time. loaded with unbearably old and overused clichés of gays, the thin plot matches perfectly the inane dialogues... it is absolutely astonishing that actors as dietmar bär or charly hübner waste their talent and time on such nonsense. 1/10

stumbled over this film on amazon.com. had never heard of its release but the three reviews gave it five stars and rave reviews so being a lover of german movies i bought a copy...have to say that i was not impressed. the production values are cheap, the story is derivative, the characters are less than engaging and for a comedy it is surprisingly short on laughs.i wanted to like this but i just found it lackluster and dull. or maybe i expected more of independent german cinema than a gay spin on the full monty and a cast of stereotypes.there are bits in the film that make no sense at all, like one of the leather bear's trying to get ecki in a sling --like he'd even look at him twice? or the vengeful ex-wife turning up at the match but ending up cheering for her estranged gay husband? bunkum is not the word! well, at least it explains the movies uk title, i suppose...

as much as i hated the movie that this series follows i can at least says that zangief was amusing. the animated series is quite possibly one of the worst things ever produced. the animation is quite often inconsistent, although it does stay consistently bad. the shape of a characters face is even capable of drastically changing in the same shot. the script and voice acting also leave something to be desired since most of the cast seems about as talented as the cast of a third grade drama play. characters like cammy and dj are so forced into stereotypes of their nationalities that episodes containing them are almost physically painful to watch, not that the series isn't painful on a regular basis anyway. episode plots seem to strive to reach new levels of lame with every turn and are so full of plot holes it amazes me they had time to show commercials. truthfully, it amazes me anyone wold pay to advertise during the show. in addition to being a bad series it is an even worse adaptation of street fighter. many of the characters maintain the failed adaptations from the movie. examples include ken and ryu being idiot con men (even though ken is supposed to be rich), blanka being guiles friend charlie, and chun li being a reporter. it takes talent to take something as bad as the movie and make it worse.

i saw the mogul video vhs of this. that's another one of those old 1980s distributors whose catalog i wish i had!this movie was pretty poor. though retitled "don't look in the attic," the main admonition that is repeated in this is "don't go to the villa." just getting on the grounds of the villa is a bad idea. a character doesn't go into the attic until an hour into the movie, and actually should have done it earlier because of what is learned there.the movie starts in turin, italy in the 1950s. two men are fighting, and a woman is telling them the villa is making them do it. one man kills the other, then regrets it, and the woman pulls out the knife and stabs him with it. she flees the villa, and after she's left a chair moves by itself (what's the point of that?), but when in the garden a hand comes up through the ground and drags he into the earth.from there, it's the present day, thirty years later. there's a séance that appears suddenly and doesn't appear to have anything to do with the movie. the children of the woman from the prologue are inheriting the house. the main daughter is played by the same actress who played her mother. at least one of the two men from the prologue seems to reoccur as another character too. she's haunted by some warnings not to go to the villa, but they all do, since if they do not use it, they forfeit it. people die. a lawyer who has won all his cases tries to investigate a little. the ending is pretty poor. why was the family cursed? an unfortunately boring movie.there's an amusing small-print disclaimer on the back of the video box that reads "the scenes depicted on this packaging may be an artist's impression and may not necessarily represent actual scenes from the film." in this case, the cover of the box is an illustration that does more or less accurately depict the aforementioned woman dragged underground scene, although there are two hands, and the woman is different. it's true, sometimes the cover art has nothing to do with the movie. i also recall seeing a reviewer who had a bad movie predictor scale, in which movies with illustrations on the cover instead of photos got at least one point for that.

i had just finished reading the book, and was really looking forward to seeing this tv adaptation which was broadcast on the hallmark channel on monday night (5/30/05). the key to the whole book was the manifesto which was stolen by the man with steel teeth, but i watched for an hour (out of 3 1/2) and i saw the man with the steel teeth but i never saw him steal a manifesto. i saw someone steal some virus but what did that have to do with the book? it's too bad because this film had great production values and a good cast, but isn't the idea of turning a book into a movie (tv or film) to get the people who read the book to be part of the audience. they only kept me for an hour. i thought the premise of the book was great and what did they do but throw out the whole premise. this book had a great mcguffin (to paraphrase hitchcock) but they ignored it. and it said in the titles that forsyth was involved in the production. they sure must have paid him a lot of money.

frederick forsyth's books are always so intricately plotted, with twists and turns, and usually a great surprise ending. this adaptation had none of that.so much of what was great in the book (the history of monk and the betrayed agents; the plot to influence the outcome of the russian election) were completely missing in this adaptation. instead, there's this completely new plot about bio-weapons that was a yawner.forsyth's protagonists always operated in the shadows, forever just slightly beyond the reach of the antagonists. the joys of his books have always been the machinations of carrying out their mission. this film resigned itself to gunfights and car chases early on.swayze's monk might as well have hung a sign around his neck saying "i am a secret agent" for all the attention that he called to himself during the film. and with all of that attention, the amount of time that it took the bad guys to catch up to him was surprising.granted there was some energy to this film, which is why i'm giving it a "3" instead of a "1". it was also great to see some underutilized pros like patrick bergin, ben cross, michael york, and barry morse.i hope that someday, someone will once again do justice to a forsyth film adaptation like "day of the jackal" did.

i first watched this movie back in the mid/late 80's, when i was a kid. we couldn't even get all the way through it. the dialog, the acting, everything about it was just beyond lame.here are a few examples... imagine these spoken real dramatically, way over-acted: "oreegon? you're going to oreegon? why would anyone want to go to oreegon?""survivalists? nobody ever told us about any survivalists!"this movie was so bad, my sister and i rented it again for her 16th birthday party, just so our friends could sit around and laugh at how awful it was. i don't think we were able to finish it then either!

stan laurel and oliver hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history, and deservedly so, so i am happy to see any of their films. ollie is recovering from a broken leg in hospital, and with nothing else to do, stan decides to visit him, and take him some boiled eggs and nuts, instead of candy. chaos begins with stan curiously pulling ollie's leg cast string, and manages to push the doctor (billy gilbert) out the window, clinging on to it, getting ollie strung up to the ceiling. when the situation calms down, stan gets ollie's clothes, as the doctor wants them both to leave, and he also manages to sit on a syringe, accidentally left by the nurse, filled with a sleeping drug, which comes into effect while he is driving (which you can tell is done with a car in front of a large screen. filled with some likable slapstick and not too bad (although repetitive and a little predictable) classic comedy, it isn't great, but it's a black and white film worth looking at. stan laurel and oliver hardy were number 7 on the comedians' comedian. okay!

this is an alright show to watch, its not the best nor the worst. i've watched it for a long time and i don't like any of the new stuff. this show has changed into some teen trash and is living much differently. i dislike that crap..i have no iq why they completely changed the theme of this show. the first season was really enjoyable to watch and is was partly amusing. the 2nd season is just out of this world dumb. i seriously don't know why the writers/directors changed this show up. many more people liked the 1st season better than the 2nd and 3rd. i will only watch the first season of this show from now on, whenever i see a new episode, ill change the f*ckin channel...ya heard me! it gets a 3/10 because i somewhat enjoyed the 1st season but hated the 2nd and 3rd

this show is pretty alright and fun to watch, its a great disney channel shows and sometimes entertaining.i really enjoyed the first season but i hated the second and third seasons. this show has completely changed around. in the first season it was more about science and animals, all that is gone now in the season and third season. its more about her life and dating. ever since that gay kid (ben) came along, this show has sucked. the writers took a perfectly good kid show and changed it to a crappy teen comedy. disney took a turn for the worse. i cant stand to watch the newest episodes anymore, they're all garbage.

i think that it was just like lizzie mcguire except that it was a lot worse than the original. the only thing that is different is that she likes animals and science and all of that geeky stuff. everything else is the same. she likes a guy that she is too nervous to ask out. and later she finds a guy that does like her and she has no clue. i think that people need to quit making that same kind of shows. and another thing that is the same is that it is always thaw the friends are two girls and one guy. don't people think that these things get old and tired and these ideas keep being used over and over and yet they keep using these ideas. but i do know people who watch this show and i know that they like them.

when i first saw this show i thought to my self " what is this!!!!!?" its one of those shows where there is a perfect fake high school world with stupid problems that are considered "huge". then there's sadie. this complete misfit for her friends and well her family. shes completely obsessed with nature not that thats a bad thing but she compares high school students to animals! like what is that!? also they made her another lizzie miguire clone ( yeah because the world definitely needs another one of those!) shes also very perfect like most tv girls are which makes me sick! so please this is a stupid show it makes no sense just skip it unless you liked lizzie mcguire or any other shows like that.

naturally sadie is by far the worst show i have ever seen, it is such a piece of sh** and loaded with complete bullsh**. i didn't find any of the gags to be funny or somewhat clever, it was all awful jokes.the acting sucks, many of the characters sucked at acting, charlotte arnold (sadie) is such a terrible actor, the other characters suck too (magaret, rain, hal).the plot isn't unique and creative at all and the show is soo very much predictable. this is one of the worst shows made of all time, it shouldn't have even been made, the idiots who are responsible of writing this garbage should get fired (if they already didn't) the fist season was actually watchable but the second season was just a disaster, its too hard to watch this show, it is beyond awful.

when this show first came to disney, i love it started watching all the time. it quickly became one of my favorite disney shows ever but this show somehow transformed into something that is disturbing and disappointing.i do now find any of the second and third season fun, they seem like a re-watch of some teens shows. i hat that garbage. the first season was very unique because it showed sadie who loved science and animals and creatures. the first season was very entertaining. i mostly don't like the second season because of ben. he annoys me and pisses the crap outta me. the plot in the second season also sucks and is just awful

omg what has disney done lately..most of their new shows really suck. suite life of zach and cody are pretty good but other shows like cory in the house, wizards of waverly place suck and are unwatchable.naturally sadie is just beyond stupid and dumb. its about a teenager named sadie who likes science and grows up and goes through her everyday life. there are her friends margaret and rain and her older annoying brother hal. there all annoying and stupid. especially margaret who thinks she's the most popular girl in school and thinks she's soo pretty...its just beyond awful. i hate all the seasons of this show, its just terrible in every way (the first season was better though).if you value your life, you wouldn't watch this crap, its painful and stupid

every time i by pass this show on tv, i absolutely and truthfully want to claw my eyes out, and rip my ears off.it's so unbelievably horrible.the jokes aren't funny, the acting is completely terrible, and the whole entire show is one major disappointment.i hate charlotte arnold's guts, and i just want to punch her in the face or stab her with a knife every time i hear her talk. she is a no talent, low iq, big waste on society, and i think she would be doing the world a favor if she just shuts the f*ck up and went away for a long time. please, i say this with all my heart, do not even watch one episode of this show!!!!!!it's not even worth 30 minutes of your life, and there are thousands of better things to do, including killing yourself, than watch this show for half an hour.

naturally sadie sucks big time, i have no idea what the people were thinking about when they wrote this garbage. this is not funny, its not cute in any way shape or form, its just disturbing and a waste of money. sadie is such a bad actor. i lost all my brain cells watching this show, it honestly seemed that this show is forced, it was such a huge over hyped pile of crap.this show sucks.its a waste of time, and money, don't bother watching this garbage. the characters are so stupid and ridiculous. in the first season its just dumb and stupid then when i saw the second season i just couldn't take anymore, it made me want to kill charlotte arnold. the second season is juts absolutely a disgrace to disney this show is also a racist piece of sh**

the first time i saw a commercial for this show was when my sisters were watching the kim possible movie. the commercial showed sadie and her friend discussing the meaning of the word nothing.it is one of the stupidest commercials i've ever seen. basically, they go back and forth with lines like "nothing is a thing, so technically nothing is something,". when i saw that, i figured it would be yet another lame lizzie maguire knockoff by disney. but i had no idea how bad.fast forward about 3 weeks, when my sister turns on the t.v. naturally sadie happened to be on. what i saw had to be one of the most unintentionally funny shows i've ever seen. how'd it go? something like this:sadie, a vegetarian tree hugger, has an incredibly unhealthy,obsessive crush on the very monotone and poorly acted acted out owen. for some reason, her friend margret decides that owen needs to be "tested" to see if he is as good as he seems. what exactly do these tests involve? well, one thing they do is put a cockroach on her notebook. why? so that she can be squeamish and ask her monotone knight in shining armor to get it off.how is this a test? because if he squishes it, he's mean and uncaring and doesn't believe that bugs, as sadie puts it, "are innocent animals too,". they spread disease and pestilance! they deserve to be squished! but of course, owen just brushes it out the window, and sadie is still in love. but that's not all! margret says he needs to be challenged one more time, on something that "no guy can pass". this one involves shoving scarves down their pants( yes, you read that right)and walking buy him to see if he notices their large butts. predictably, he doesn't notice, and we see sadie in her bizarre and strange notebook world. sadie decides that she wants to be with owen forever,raise a family with him, and as she puts it, "live like wood ducks with their brood,". that's just plain wrong.bottom line: this is the strangest, most insane show i've watched. for those who like to make fun of dumb stuff, you'll love it. for anyone else, skip this show.

i do not find this show at all funny. i actually think it is much worse than any of the other terrible disney channel sit-coms right now. charlotte arnold is an interesting choice to play sadie, because she can't act. the jokes on this show are terribly unfunny, and it makes it even worse when the only cast member that has a little bit (and i mean little bit) of acting talent is justin bradley as sadie's brother hal. jasmine richards and michael d'ascenzo portray sadie's friends. there both really stupid and just terrible actors. two words that can really describe this show is terribly corny. it's corny humor that only little girls find funny because their brains have not developed yet. now i've explained my hatred for the acting and the horrible humor, what's next? the whole premise of the show is a stupid idea. she changed again (not so sciencey an ben-loving) and suddenly nobody recognizes her? it's moronic. in summation, i hate this show, however little girls who do not have a concept of funny will enjoy it, so i guess that's what they're going for over quality. although i can say as much as, the first season is clearly better than the second.bottom line: just don't watch any of it.my rating: awful show. tv g. 30 mins.

for those of us who are part of the real world of ballet - this film is completely ridiculous. ivan kirov was basically a gymnast, not a ballet dancer. viola essen at the time was with ballet theater, now american ballet theater, and a reasonably good dancer, but except for dame judith anderson, the acting is amateurish and checkov is completely over the top .... embarrassingly so! i saw this film at age 14 and at that time, never having seen a ballet, i was very impressed. however, later in life, long after i had completed my own career as a dancer - i purchased the video tape of it, curious as to what it was like after so many years. i couldn't believe how naive hollywood could be about the world of ballet. but it was made in the mid 40s, before the red shoes or the turning point, the latter giving a true picture of the ballet world. the entire cast of spectre have now passed away ... ivan kirov (not his real name)dying at age 79. it was his one and only film, thereafter being kept by a chicago business man .. so the rumor goes.

with actors like depardieu and richard it is really a hard task to make a dull movie. but weber is a master in setting a slow pace and making supposedly funny scenes without any wits and depth. this movie is high on story but low on character. you never get to know any of the characters except for superficial slapstick. unfortunately weber has no idea what slapstick is all about. his style could be described at hit and miss. of course some people laugh when they see someone slip on a banana peel. weber directs his humor at this lot. it is a shame how bad he uses good talent. many good french comedians have been wasted away by mediocre directors.

badly shot, badly edited, clumsy dialogue, flat characters, unsuccessful adaption of a novel. it doesn't really get much worse. decent acting and good popcorn saved me for this hour and a half - felt more like three hours - of boredom. occasional good one-liners.david is a dim-witted young man, who has never recovered from losing his brother at an early age. he puts his faith in a chinese philosophy mumbo jumbo video, although that doesn't seem to help him much in real life. david is a member of a debt-collectors gang, where every member has an iq below sea level. a lacking script, along with uncreative shooting and even worse editing, make what could have been quite funny incidents of failed debt-collecting look like a amateurish homemade reality show.david rents an apartment from an elementary school teacher, haraldur, who by dropping a couple of sentences about his own importance convinces david he is dealing with the most dangerous criminal in iceland. a severely lacking script doesn't offer david anything to base his opinion on. a couple of scenes showing haraldur doing something that david could have misinterpreted would have done the work. the potentials of film as media, as opposed to the text of the book this film is based on, are not exploited.at first, david's connection with haraldur raises his status within the debt-collectors gang, but the prevailing paranoia in the criminal world forces david to show where his loyalty lies.the plot of the film is fine, but then it is based on the book. this could have been a much better film. a good screenwriter could have made something of this material. sadly, that is not the case.the acting is generally good. pétur jóhann is excellent and credible as david. eggert þorleifsson doesn't get much to work with, but does his best with what little material he has. ingvar sigurðsson and michael imperioli (in a tiny role) manage alright.overall opinion: what could have been quite a funny and entertaining film about a dim-witted anti-hero in a debt-collectors gang, becomes a boring, badly-crafted film made after a poor manuscript. staring at your toes for an hour and a half would be more enjoyable.

i did have a good time the first 45 min. or so, but then suddenly it was all down hill. the suspense somewhat started to get thin and the jokes somewhat the same all over. what kept it going were the good actors.but the problem with this film is that it is trying to be cleverly funny,like tarantino and god is that outdated stuff. tarantino being a bit overrated sometimes, this movie comes ten years too late. at best it is for teenagers, and i am sure many of them find the character of johann funny, which he is for the first 30 min. the other problem i have with it is that the story fades away towards the end more and more, thou i tried to find a recovery point. maybe it didn't recover because the lack of passion comes with the effort of trying to be cleverly funny. also, like in many movies, sure, good actors who can afford it don't seem to demand a better dialogue, or just turn down the script.

i found this to be a watchable all be it very predictable movie. there was some good stunt work that gave a fair degree of excitement and suspense to the story. one did however have to suspend ones credulity on a number of occasions for the plot to work. for example despite losing their transfer cable, couplings and harness when the pilot retracted the undercarriage manually, they fortunately found a spare on-board the aircraft complete with caribbeans. according to the plot drilling a hole in the ceiling of the vault would disable the alarm system in the vault when the system was reactivated (i can't think why), according to daltry there battery operated drill would be unable to drill through the vault ceiling however they just happened to have a hydraulic drill complete with hoses and fittings to fit the equally convenient take off points in the planes hydraulic system located above the vault. as the plane has a closed hydraulic system it is hard to see how this could be accomplished without affecting the control systems or at least setting hydraulic pressure alarms in the cockpit. accepting this for the sake of the plot it takes them several minutes to drill a small hole through the top of the vault (tension will they be able to drill through before fed's get there to check the false alarm), yet from the time the vault door closed and before the fed's had walked the few feet to the second security door they had cut a squire hole in the roof of the vault big enough for them to get through. one can accept all theses and other inconsistencies for the sake of a good yarn, however what spoiled the movie for me was when what appears to have been an effort by the script writers to discuses what up to that point was a fairly predictable ending, they killed off the two hero's (if one can refer to crocks as hero's) ketchum & brooks one was shot and thrown out of a 747 at 10,000 feet the other wiliest sliding down the cable between the two planes the villain daltry with one hand manages to unhook the cable carrying the weight of a full grown man with the air pressure of several hundred miles per hour pressing on him, and letting him fall to his death. and yet in the next sequence these two without any kind of explanation (however tenuous or implausible) have miraculously survived the full from 10.000 feet and had time to set up an elaborate scam to get the money. the only comment on there survival was to sophie that her brother is a bad shot. don't expect an oscar nomination for this one.

the only reason any of the hundred or so users watched this movie was because they belong to the crew, were friends to the crew, or were obsessive fans of either lance henriksen or lorenzo lamas. i personally follow the "cult of lance", so i was disappointed to see that despite being the headliner, it's in name only. playing rich criminal newcastle, lance is a joy to watch but all of his screen time is relegated to the beginning of the movie. newcastle sets up a 747 heist which includes ketchum (lamas) and a bunch of forgettable characters. the biggest shock to this viewer was that the pre-heist scenes were not all that bad. with the exception of somewhat obnoxious and rather confused looking aviva gale, who times every line with the finesse of a grade school play actress, acting was decent all around, and none of the lines really made me cringe.but once the heist occurs, the movie falls asleep. not only is their plan the most ridiculous thing ever captured on film, but it's dragged out for far too long. this isn't a very deep movie, and you have to fill out your 90 minutes, but these scenes are so boring i nearly nodded off at two in the afternoon. one particular sequence in which we watch each and every one of the characters perform the same task over and over again is especially difficult to get through. the movie's name is "rapid exchange", but the exchange is far from rapid - it's overlong and bloated to extremes. perhaps it would have worked if any of the characters had real personalities, but come on, there's only so much you can ask out of a straight-to-video movie airing of showtime extreme.thankfully, there are several laughs, intentional and unintentional (lorenzo lamas is seemingly a master of disguise, which makes for a couple of incredibly bizarre scenarios), and lance returns in the film's end, albeit for a brief period of time. it's a bad movie, and i probably didn't have to tell you that myself, but it's far from the worst thing i've ever seen. i wouldn't put it too high on the list of henriksen films, since he's been in some real gems with greater screen time, and either way the movie loses a lot of steam once the heist begins, but the best thing i can say for rapid exchange is that the last two films i watched before it were the mainstream hostage and the overrated, pretentious crash - and this was better than both.

as a fan of henriksen (i liked him in the "millennium" series) and of course lorenzo "renegade" lamas, i had expected at least something from this film. sadly, the plot is predictable, the acting is bad and the computergraphics used for most stunts don't work out. sometimes it even looks like they've captured some shots from microsoft flight simulator.the cinematography sucks as well. unnecessary funky camerawork in the beginning only detracts (from the cheesy dialogue) and gives the film a cheap, made-for-video-look. it works in hiphop-movies and jet li movies, but seems out of place in this flick.i would have liked this film 10 years ago. i was 11 then.

i absolutely hated this movie. even though the movie wanted to transmit some kind of social message, it was done in such a cliché ridden and melodramatic way like a mexican soap opera.also the acting was terrible especially charityn and her son. that's one of the problems with dominican movies, they use celebrities that can't even act just to attract the masses. i'm even more ashamed about the positive reviews here which sadly means dominicans are just being condescending to what's done here instead of giving honest and critical opinions that will help our film industry base itself on quality.

komodo vs. cobra is not going to set the world on fire. it's not a hallmark of cinema history. what it is is a group of underfunded filmmakers trying to make another movie, make another paycheck, and continue to support themselves and their families. as such i give these efforts a lot of slack. i mean, come on, it has to be hard to be a russian special effects technician. not a lot of big budget films getting made there. but-- they are a dedicated bunch and more than willing to throw their all into whatever lame american monster flick needs affordable sfx. and i get a kick out of looking for the same locations appear time and again in these flicks. if for some reason you find yourself watching this again, look at the sequence where pare and company are walking through a "jungle." look at their feet and you'll see paved walkways. and if you happen to still have a copy of "ai assault" (shown a week or two earlier also on scifi), you'll see the folks in there tramping through the same ersatz jungle. come to think of it, i think the helicopters land in the same clearing in both flicks. i can admire the thriftiness of these films. every dollar really does show up on the screen! too bad there just aren't enough dollars......

the good things first: i agree with another viewer who said that gene raymond has a marvelous drunk scene. he does -- i was tickled to finally get a chance to laugh. and there were other moments i found amusing -- raymond's parents in the bathroom with the defective plumbing, and the scene in the restaurant with robert montgomery trying to make carole lombard jealous by mouthing sweet nothings to a stranger. but overall, i was dismayed. i love carol lombard and most of hitchcock. and i understand the restrictions laid on productions by the hays code. but this was embarrassing and awful to watch. of course i knew they'd end up together, this is a romantic comedy after all. but it made no sense, it happened too fast. plus i can't believe the professions of love when confronted with such hurtful behavior, both physical and confrontational.

blind date (columbia pictures, 1934), was a decent film, but i have a few issues with this film. first of all, i don't fault the actors in this film at all, but more or less, i have a problem with the script. also, i understand that this film was made in the 1930's and people were looking to escape reality, but the script made ann sothern's character look weak. she kept going back and forth between suitors and i felt as though she should have stayed with paul kelly's character in the end. he truly did care about her and her family and would have done anything for her and he did by giving her up in the end to fickle neil hamilton who in my opinion was only out for a good time. paul kelly's character, although a workaholic was a man of integrity and truly loved kitty (ann sothern) as opposed to neil hamilton, while he did like her a lot, i didn't see the depth of love that he had for her character. the production values were great, but the script could have used a little work.

first: a warning.i recently saw this movie on dvd in the universal 'hitchcock collection' series. the source print looks to be in immaculate condition, but the image is a bit soft, suggesting it might be a second generation copy straight from video. the framing is far too tight, so all the compositions are terrible. even the title of the movie is cropped. i gather from other imdb reviews that there is a much better version available.mr and mrs smith is just a footnote to hitchcock's career.in his lengthy interviews with francois truffaut in the sixties, hitchcock gave a comprehensive overview of his whole body of work, but all he could say about this picture is that he did it as a favour to carole lombard and that he didn't understand the characters so just photographed norman krasna's screenplay.in truth, there is not much more that needs to be said.it is a screwball comedy out of the same mould as it happened one night, his girl friday and philapdelphia story. carole lombard is a typically feisty wife who learns that her marriage is technically invalid, falls out with with her husband on the flimsiest of pretexts and spends most of the picture being 'adorably' unreasonable.robert montgomery does well enough as the put upon husband, but it is hard not to lose patience with him. long before the end of the movie the audience is saying: "dump the silly cow, she's not worth it."gene raymond plays the best friend with whom she becomes engaged. he is supposed to be a courtly, 'old family' southerner, although this is not obvious from his accent and only really becomes apparent in the drunk scene (which he otherwise plays very well). he is an honourable, generous, teetotal gentleman, so of course he is bullied and patronised by robert montgomery and made the butt of many of the jokes - although he is not as badly treated as the similar ralph bellamy character in his girl friday.this movie feels like it was made by people who only knew of screwball comedies by reputation, but hadn't actually seen one. for example, a good screwball comedy has a strong central idea with a number of on-going comic threads that continually intertwine and overlap. here, all the comedy elements are just strung out, like beads on a necklace. this is screwball comedy by the numbers.it is the same with the direction. typically, these comedies race along at an ever increasing pace that rises to near hysteria by the end. hitchcock doesn't get this. his direction is somewhat lethargic and the picture becomes a stately succession of scenes that all seem slightly over-written (but under-nourished) and slightly too long. he was never a particularly good director of actors so he just lets the cast get on with it. they do ok.hitchcock had a good sense of humour, which he frequently used in his thrillers, but he had no feel for comedy as a genre. his later trouble with harry was also a misfire, for similar reasons to this movie, but at least he was involved in that picture. here he is just going through the motions.all the people connected with this movie were good solid professionals so it is not especially bad. it just feels a bit derivative, over-familiar, over-long and ultimately rather flat.mr and mrs smith is one for carole lombard fans and hitchcock completists only.

i only voted it 2/10 mainly because hitchcock agreed to direct it.he certainly had an off-day with predictable plot lines, stupid childish characters who are desperately trying to be funny.there were "twee" hygenic, sanitised, emasculated "sex" scenes at a time when the hollywood production code was in full force.lazy male characters in the film who like "soap" characters never do a stroke of work for which they are paid.it always irritates me when food is usually never eaten by actors (one exception was in the eating scene in "tom jones" (1963); although copious amounts of drink are consumed - actors have to leave their mouths free for the next line! carole lombard certainly fitted hitchcock's "cool blond" idealised image of a heroine, but what ever possessed him to direct this worthless unfunny script, he should have stuck to his thrillers.it certainly has not worn well over the last 69 years.i couldn't wait for it to end as it gradually irritated me no end.

this was hitchcock's third hollywood feature, and it appears he was yet to settle into a pattern of consistency, turning from faithful adaptation of classic novel in rebecca, to espionage thriller in foreign correspondent, and now this romantic comedy in the mould of the "screwball" pictures of the 1930s.hitchcock's formal method, on the other hand, had by now settled into something consistent, so much so that he was unable (or at least unwilling) to deviate from it. it was unwise then for him to step outside his usual genre, and a romantic comedy was particularly inappropriate. in rebecca it was actually great to see hitchcock constrained by his producer and the source text, forced to turn his technique to heavy gothic drama, but for mr and mrs smith there is a huge mismatch between form and content. in other words, hitchcock was no ernst lubitsch.first, let's look at the romantic angle. the best love scenes in hitchcock films were wild, passionate and slightly dangerous  the "ever fallen in love with someone you shouldn't have?" situation, and he was great at depicting that. this is something that makes a much earlier film, rich and strange, one of the few hitchcock non-thrillers that really works. hitch is not so good however when it comes to a more gentle and familiar love story. a light, tender touch is required and hitch doesn't have it.secondly, take the comedy. of course, hitchcock films could be funny  the lady vanishes is probably the best example  but only when the jokes were sprinkled throughout the story. the master of suspense simply isn't enough of a comedy director to create a film that has funny bones. he cuts up scenes as he would in a thriller  snappy opposing angles of people talking, inserted close-ups of hands and feet, point-of-view shots  but doesn't allow for comic timing or focus on gags. for example, the business with carole lombard's dress bursting at the seems is shown to us with a couple of close-ups, but these are timed more as if he were revealing some crucial plot point, and have no comedic impact. occasionally hitchcock's style does roughly coincide with the comedy  for example the arrangement of characters in the scene at the club, where robert montgomery tries to make it look as if he is with the attractive, sophisticated woman at the next table  but such moments are few and far between.even the cast of mr and mrs smith are not up to standard. i'm not sure this was robert montgomery's strength lay, and he is boring here. this was of course exactly where "queen of screwball" carole lombard's strength lay, and yet while she is clearly acting well the scenes are simply not geared to capturing comedy performances. even jack carson, who could be hilarious when he was really allowed to let go before the camera, fails to perk things up at all. of course, neither of these fine comedy actors is helped by the screenplay, which isn't exactly bursting with laughs in the first place, even if the basic story is a fairly good premise.the only full-on comedy hitchcock made after this was the trouble with harry, and that sort of worked because it played upon his familiar suspensefulness. however it was only when the story could exist independently of the humour, when the basic framework was suspense  as it is in the lady vanishes or family plot  that hitchcock was capable of doing comedy well.

i have done some research on ed gien, and i have found a few interesting things. like the fact that ed gien, was quiet and a loner, not some buff over bearing jerk as in this movie. i will say that i didn't finish this movie but i will. i will cringe through the fact that all of us, wisconsinites, talk like we are from kentucy. you know the funny, but oh so sad factor in this movie, is wisconsin isn't as hot as they made it look.this movie is not only an insult to wisconsin people, being a wisconsite myself, but it is a complete insult to a man that was proved to be an insane, lonely man. he killed two people and the movie couldn't even get that right. ed didn't get that close and personal and scare people, he shot the two and only people, he killed. so, why do these movies lie and say "based on a true story"? this is not based on nothing but the lies the director came up with in his foul head.a joke and nothing more!ok, i would like to add on to this. i did finish this oh so sad movie, and i personal would like to laugh at the director. do your homework when making a movie. i would like to inform you that there are no mountains (for those who have never been in wisconsin) and oh there is no desert! what the hell, there was more pine trees and snow in ravenous and that was suppose to be shot in californa. ok, for those who know nothing about ed gein, i would like to give you, your history lesson. ed gein was thought to have killed his family, but it was never proved. he killed a bartender, she was shot at bar close when no one was around. he took the dead bartender back to his house. 10 years later he shot and killed the store clerk, he stoled the cash register and the store truck. he was caught because of this murder, he came in the day before when her son was there and asked about antifreeze. the day he killed her, he was in there buying the antifreeze, and the reciept that only had antif..... was the only evidence they had to start a world wide man hunt. he robbed graves, in fact in robbed 56 graves. he hate the people he dug up and he made furinture; lamp shades, couches, chairs, and other things. he had a family that he had dinner with once and awhile and they threw all the meat he ever gave them out when he was caught, considering he was caught at their house. he was arrested and hid in the back of a cop car, in fear of what may happen to him. how do i know all of this? i read the book the judge that tried him wrote. after this movie was over, after watching the whole horrific thing, not only am i offended by the directors horriable view on what wisconsin women look like. i mean it was hard to tell who this guy had on the slab half the time, you know cause wisconsin women are all blondes. please! i am overly offended by the lack of homework this guy did and the poor job he did making this movie. i have no idea who this kane guy is and i think he may be ok in something else, but he did a horrible job playing ed gein. after all of this i am so sad i wasted the 3.99 on the movie. movie after finished was completely untrue, this movie is like me saying that the world is flat and george washington wasn't our first president. come on people, that is your history, and this is wisconsin's history. to end this rant, how would all of you feel if i made a movie and george washington looked like brad pitt (some of you may think that is fine, but it would be not true) and he lived and wasn't the president and whatever. you can't rewrite history.

wow! i truly regret watching this picture... funny, i agreed to see it just for my wife, who endured the torture of seeing it about a half an hour before retiring, while i stayed in front of the tv, but only to feed the the masochistic in me and i because i wanted to know if this movie was so bad in its entirety or if there were some redeemable aspects which might alleviate the feeling i had of being a stupid for watching this **** called two girls and a guy...everything in this picture is wrong, totally wrong... since the initial, absurd, premise of two women stupid enough to stay with their common boyfriend, until the awful, but merciful, end, not forgetting the horrible acting of the three actors... don't believe the rumors, the junkie's acting is bad and i don't see how graham has made herself a known name within the movie industry...i wonder why, after the producers saved some bucks with just three actors and an only location, they didn't hire a person to write the script instead of putting a monkey to do it with his ***...at least, i felt a little fine when i destroyed the dvd and threw it to the trash... anyway, i liked somehow (and just a little) the brunette actress, natasha something, but that was not enough to beat the incredibly stupid and crazy premise of face-off (changing faces), so two girls and a guy to the bottom goes... stay away from this ****!

uh, oh! i just said the this "classic" film has a plot that stinks! well, it's true,...so get over it! this film was a vanity project for joseph p. kennedy in which his mistress starred and money flowed to make her an even bigger star. today, only a fragmentary copy exists--one that was retored a few years back. however, even if the film had been in perfect shape, it still would have stunk for many reasons. and, without further ado, here are some of my reasons: first, gloria swanson, aged 31 plays a girl in a convent school--perhaps aged 16 or 18! come on--she looks old enough to be the mother of many of the kids.second, the movie all hinges on the stupid concept of "love at first sight". while some people believe it this, it is ridiculous to believe that a prince would throw away everything on a woman he didn't even know! what a lot of hooey! third, the movie is histrionic and the plot is nuts! after leaving the school, kelly goes off to east africa and then becomes "queen of the whores"--and later, after the evil queen back in europe dies (that's convenient), the prince is able to get out of prison, actually finds kelly and marries her and she then becomes queen of a real honest-to-goodness country! gimme a break--this is ridiculous, even in the days of silent film this plot was a groaner!so, in summary, this is a poor film with great production values (mistresses need to look good) that is parading around as a classic! there are so many better silent films out there--see them first and avoid this tripe.

i can't believe this terrible film was made by the same people who made lepa sela lepo gore. watch that and skip this. the plot is muddled and the characters are mostly two-dimensional stereotypes. i suspect the editor went on vacation halfway through the film because quick, choppy cuts start to appear that only confuse matters rather than elucidate them. the ending doesn't make sense either.this is predominantly a propaganda film made so serbs can feel sorry for themselves and vilify america for the nato bombings of 1999. they do this by perpetuating lies about serbs being our allies during wwii, claiming the whole world is unjustly against them, and completely ignoring everything said and done by slobodan milosevic, like waging war on three neighboring countries. they seem intent on making a political film but only show a few seconds of milosevic on a tv screen with no sound. a nationalist agenda obviously superseded any consideration of art which was not the case with lepa sela.regrettably, i recommended this film to a teacher when it played last week at the seattle international film festival. he also cited the bad editing and confusing plot, and i had to apologize for the bad advice. you've been warned.

i got this movie for fifty cents at a going out of business sale. i want my fifty cents back. bad acting, poor script writing, lousy direction, historically inaccurate, even the sound of the film is awful. it's not the subject matter that offends. i'm one of the many who find suspense films and true crime films very interesting. the subject matter could have been treated more seriously, with much more attention to detail and accuracy, and the lack of respect shown for the victims and their devastated friends and family is enough to puzzle anyone. also, there is little to no attention paid to what could have caused someone to begin the bizarre behavior that ed gein was displaying in acting out these horrible crimes. save your time and sanity. don't watch this awful film. if you bought it, you have my sympathy. it's not a total waste though...you can throw away the disc and make use of the plastic case!

there's only 2 reasons i watch this show...i invested the time already in previous episodes and col tigh. for all you supposed sci-fi fans out there who love the new bsg, give me a break! go read some classic sci-fi novels by the true greats or watch some of the milestone films and tv shows from days gone by and you'll see what hacks these bsg writers are. their only gimmick is "who is the fifth cylon". poor writing and really, truly no sense of character development. if adama resigns or tries to take power or cries again or discovers the inner father he should have been one more time...ahhhhh! and roslin is as annoying a character that's ever been put aboard a starship. out the airlock with her. i could care less if it's six more months before they conclude. these wannabe writers were out of tricks in season one. if you don't know that, you just don't know writing.

i really enjoyed bg seasons 1-3 and really couldn't understand those who didn't like it. but i can't defend this nonsense. spoilers follow.the first problem is that the characters are now doing inexplicably stupid things on a regular basis: so if starbuck thinks she knows where earth is why not send her out in a raptor? would the admiral accept the resignation of his third most experienced officer? would the quorum elect their newest member, the non-elected adama junior? he has about three weeks political experience under his belt, and is the son of a man they distrust. would adama send gaeta and halo along with starbuck leaving himself short of senior officers? would adama put a man into having sex with cylon prisoners in charge of the fleet?i just don't buy any of this.secondly, while i accept there have been miracles and references to god up to the end of season 3, it's now all totally over the top. i started watching bg because i thought it was sci fi, not some biblical epic. i expected the characters to continue to behave reasonably intelligently, and wanted some satisfying explanations regarding some of the odder developments in the series. baltar was the best character in the show, but he now seems to be totally insane. not illogical considering what he's been through, but very unsatisfying.all the characters appear to be just puppets dancing to an unknown third party's behest (some godlike entity). this isn't good drama, it's annoying and a writing cop out. ok, so what are the good points? nice battle at the start of 4.1. some good dramatic scenes (well acted) when viewed in isolation. a good final scene, a nice cliffhanging curve ball of a development.but this isn't sci fi, it's turned into fantasy. i can't imagine how the writers can recover this one.

the plot outline of this movie is similar to the original. someone gets kidnapped, the prince is incest with saving her, odet turns into a swan, the turtle/frog/puffin first the "bad" magician as best they can, and in the end.... anyways, there is not much new here. with the exception of a lack of well known voice talent. sorry, no palance nor cleese and thus jean-bob was a disapointment.

the worst sequel i've ever seen. really awful songs which is upsetting considering how fantastic the first films score and story is! also, which ruins the film for me is the fact there is no john cleese so jean bob might as well not even be in it and the new villains are dreadful. it is really annoying how that old woman type thing cant string a simple sentence together properly without repeating her words over and over and over again. but to be fair uberta not shutting up is a little bit funny. but the fact it was her 50th birthday: why do they draw her looking like an 80 year old? i was going to give this a 1 but now i think... i might give it a 2. but still the story line is no where near as good as the first film . it is similar without the humour from certain characters. overall i disliked this film entirely because of the disappointing music, the severe lack of voice talent: having changed the voice of prince derek and jean bob, the new villains, disappointing storyline the annoying habits of some characters, and the very simple animation.

i was disappointed with the sequel to the swan princess. i can see what they were trying to do with the story, show how married life was going for odette and derek but the story wasn't interesting enough to hold my attention and it seemed to cover the same bases as the original.it isn't funny. the only bit i found humorous was when jean-bob was turned into a prince and then back into a frog and no-one saw it happen and he was trying to convince them that it really did.the villain is rubbish and the animation isn't as impressive as the first film.the queen is a very irritating character and instead of cheering with derek to rescue his mother, you're hoping that the villain puts a spell on her voice box to stop her talking.it is a shame because i really liked the first movie but it didn't live up to my expectations.

when i was a little girl, i absolutely adored the swan princess, it was reliving the same fairy tales of snow white, sleeping beauty, and cinderella, the princess and her prince who saves the day is always a timeless story that will never die, well, hopefully. but i figured that i would check out the sequels for the swan princess to see what they were like and unfortunately, this is the typical cartoon sequel that just disappoints more than entertains. the only character i found still very amusing was the queen, she was very funny in this movie and had the best part. but with the voice changes, they were noticeable and also bothered me quite a bit, i don't mean to be picky, just it was too weird for me. the story also was just more or less borrowed from the first swan princess, just the villain in this movie is following rothbart's footsteps.odette and derek are about to celebrate their one year anniversary, but derek has been too preoccupied with fighting for his kingdom to keep it safe. with his mother's birthday also coming up, he forgets about that since there is a new villain in town, clavious, who is hoping to go above and beyond where rothbart's powers went and kidnaps the queen on her birthday. but odette must change back into her swan self in order to help derek fight him and save his mother.the swan princess 2 is of course more than alright for the kids, that i never mind, it's good clean fun for them. the reason why these sequels are disappointing though is because it is usually just for the kids, that is the audience they aim for, but it's more enjoyable when the jokes and story can be enjoyed by everyone. now there are a few laughs and giggles here and there, but this wasn't as clever in my opinion to the first swan princess. i would recommend it for the little one's, but if you're looking for a fun cartoon movie, i'd recommend staying with the first swan princess.4/10

mickey rourke ( who was once a famous movie star ) plays martin fallon an ira terrorist who accidentally blows up a school bus full of children who is so disgusted by his actions decides to leave the ira and goes on the run in london !!!! mild spoilers !!!!the movie's opening is rather disturbing as the lives of little children are ended in a fireball . things like this happened throughout the 1970s and 1980s and into the 1990s in northern ireland which gives a prayer for the dying a stark realism . however as soon as fallon decides he's going to give up violence ( what ? he's a terrorist and he's never blown up innocent passerbys before ? ) realism disappears and clichés and ridiculous plot twists take place . martin is employed by the london underworld ( don't they have their own hit men ? )to commit a hit while he wears an ira " uniform " ( never knew the provos wore uniforms ) at a cemetery in broad daylight ( wouldn't an ira man use a bomb placed under a car ? ) where he's spotted by a priest who recognises him while he was in the sas . hands up who thinks i'm lying ? i'm not and we're half way through the running time and there's still several clichés to come this all sounds very silly and it is but what do you expect from a novel by jack higgins ? everything is clichéd , contrived and stereotypical and the bits that aren't are just plain bizarre . the critics slaughtered this movie when it came out , most notably they stated that it might have some potential if the movie had bob hoskins playing gangster jack meehan and alan bates playing the sas soldier turned priest and for once the critics would have been right . they should also noted the film might have been less dire if fallon was played by someone who was capable of doing an irish accent . rourke might be hunky and macho ( oh gawd another movie with an ira uberhunk ) but accents aren't his strong point any more than character acting is . to give you an idea how disappointing prayer for the dying is the director ended up disowning it which is always a bad sign as a footnote the original release of prayer for the dying in britain was delayed for several months because of " the enniskillen bombing " . in november 1987 the provisional ira exploded a bomb in the centre of enniskillen where a remembrance day parade which commemorates britain's war dead was being held . eleven ( 11 ) people were killed and scores more injured . it wasn't an accident and no one left the ira because of it

mickey rourke is enjoying a renaissance at the moment... and fair play to him. i always liked his image and his acting ability in such fare as angel heart and johnny handsome. you know what you are going to get with rourke - mean, moody, dirty. but this film gives you much more - and you don't want most of it.first and foremost - this whole thing just doesn't make sense. rourke is a hardened ira killer who after killing a bus-load of schoolchildren flees ireland for london. he is on the run from the cops and from his own army comrades. he has also vowed to never kill again. it looks like the bus full of kids finally did it for him.however, when he gets to london he is tracked down by a local mobster (bates - looking like his eyebrows and hair came straight off a burton's dummy) to kill his main competitor in turn for £50,000 and a boat trip to the us. rourke reluctantly agrees to do it but is seen by a priest (hoskins) and confesses the crime to him in the confessional in order to keep the priest's mouth shut. he figures it is better than killing him.a wealth of things arise here which just don't add up : 1. why pick rourke to off your competition? as is illustrated by a scene whereby an employee is pinned to a wall by a couple of heavies with what look like awls - these london guys are tough enough anyway to do their own killing. 2. not only that but the mobster gets a guy to follow rourke and witness the killing with his own eyes. why didn't that guy simply kill the competitor and save all the hassle of dealing with rourke? 3. hoskins sees the murder take place and the police let him go off - without protection, i may add - to take confession? no way. 4. rourke hangs around the church (right next to where he carried out the murder ) immediately after the crime takes place to go to confession. why aren't the cops checking the place out? 5. rourke hangs around the church and hoskin's blind niece in particular, for days afterwards without anybody bothering him. what? he's on the run and he stays put by the very place where he committed another murder? stupid. 6. the cops actually meet rourke in the church "fixing" the organ and have no idea who he is. do they not know he is on the run for the school bus bombing? they don't even check up on him? 7. why get rourke to kill for you, and then tell him to wait around for a few days to get on the boat? you'd think you'd want to get rid of him immediately. or kill him. one or the other? 8. why does bates' brother suddenly decide to rape the blind niece in the midst of all the waiting? could he not restrain himself for a few days? at least until rourke has been safely offed to the states? ridiculous. 9. rourke suddenly has inner turmoil after all his years of killing and wins over the blind niece immediately - even after she knows he is a killer, she still loves him? again - utterly ludicrous. and besides - she falls in "love" with him in record time - a few days !!!! 10. the whole bomb thing at the end is just plain silly from bates point of view. 11. things happen in parts of this film that just do not make sense or are simply in there to help the storyline (and i say that in jest) along. bates' houses rourke in a whorehouse until the boat is ready to sail and rourke suddenly displays a moral high ground to respect the whore in the house - but yet will bed a blind girl. 12. rourke asks a henchman on the boat where bates is - and the henchman practically spurts out the entire movements of his boss in less than 10 seconds. it was embarrassing - the guy was telling rourke far more than he even asked. 13. hoskin's priest is an ex-army guy and we see him beat up three henchmen behind a pub. totally uncalled-for and yet another cringe-worthy scene.i'm gonna stop there at unlucky 13 without mentioning rourke's hair (so falsely red it is laughable), his accent (which to be fair is not too bad sometimes but deteriorates to a barely heard mumble at other times), his clothes, walk, looks to the heavens etc. nor will i mention the music and the choppy editing style.oooppps - i have just mentioned them.overall - a disaster of a film with some obvious religious imagery thrown in (rourke on the cross, preaching from a pulpit) which would embarrass a first year film student never mind a top star and director.4/10.

jack higgins' straightforward thriller about a guilt-ridden ira bomber forced into "one last job" (where have i heard that plot before?) gets a snarky treatment from cult director mike hodges. mickey rourke, with alarming red hair, confesses all to the priest (bob hoskins, of all people) who accidentally witnessed the shooting. the rules of the church keep father bob from talking, but then rourke goes and falls in love with the priest's blind niece. they bond at the church organ. what? really, that's the plot. alan bates is around as the top dog mobster who's calling the shots (literally) and he seems to be the only actor who's on to the jokey tone hodges is aiming at. bates is all set to do a sort of u.k. prizzi's honor, but no one else, including an effortlessly charismatic liam neeson in a supporting role, has been informed.

let's get things straight. i was raised catholic, and in a very religious family, and spent as much time at church and talking to priests as at home. that was useful for two things: to make a convinced atheist out of me, and to give me deep, insightful knowledge about the church and its dogmas. and i say: if a catholic priest witnesses a murder, and clearly sees the face of the killer, he can report it to the police, even if the murderer has confessed to him afterwards. he can not reveal what he's told in confession, but he can talk about anything he sees outside that, and confession is useless to keep his mouth shut. so, here we have a movie entirely sustained on a lie. and another lie is there's no absolution for murder. according to the catholic church, there's absolution for any sin as long as there's sincere repentance. so far, the biggest plot holes in this weak thriller.as people frequently say, this movie would have improved if bob hoskins and alan bates had switched roles. hoskins is naturally suitable to play gangsters (i will never lament enough that he lost al capone in favor of one of de niro's weakest performances in "the untouchables") and bates' features would have been perfect as the priest with a gray past. but above that, i think the film would have been much better had real-life ulster native liam neeson (back then mostly unknown to big audiences) played mickey rourke's part. not only his face is perfect to play tormented characters, but he'd make us believe the character as real, something rourke just can't. back in the 80s, rourke was not a bad actor (afterwards he seemed to lose his talent along with his looks), but he was one of those performers, like brad dourif, who's as good as the director he works with. and as a former ira terrorist, rourke's acting comes across more like a pimp. sad to think that, had this movie been made just some three to six years later (when neeson achieved moderate celebrity status in 1990 with sam raimi's enjoyable "darkman", and superstardom in 1993 with "schindler's list", while rourke became pretty much of a forgotten has-been), liam and mickey could have switched parts to greater benefit (rourke would have been effective in the supporting role of docherty, but just can't carry this movie along as the lead). yet another missed opportunity, and yet another film with the potential of being a classic, that became instantly forgettable fare.ironically enough, the often criticized score (by underrated composer bill conti) worked for me. i didn't find it overly-melodramatic, but suitably gritty and beautiful. it reminded me of howard shore's score for "the silence of the lambs". here's to mike hodges' talent, who made "get carter", yes, but don't forget he's the mastermind behind "flash gordon" as well...it seems the film was massacred in the cutting room (it shows, as some parts are really choppy and confusing, and others just don't glue) and a director's cut is waiting to see the light. ok, but i seriously doubt that will make it a great movie, as we'll still have the bad casting and the false premise there. 4/10.

all of the great horror movies of the 70's, 80's, and even the early 90's from psycho, to texas chainsaw masacre (the original not that warmed over wb crap), to silence of the lambs. the characters in these movies were based upon the crimes of ed gein. the writers and directors tapped into the true story for the inspiration for creating some of the greatest *fictional* movie killers of all time.the old horror films were great because even though the crimes were loosely based upon the facts of the case of ed gein, they were truly fictional and far removed from the true story.in the case of this movie, they've created a fictional horror film in which they tried to capitalize on the true story in order to sell a cheap, poorly acted, love story between two characters that nobody really cares about. in fact, in a *good* horror film these two characters would have been excellent victims.end of lecture...in short, this film was like wearing clammy underwear on a cold afternoon sipping on a nice cup of chilled vomit.

mickey rourke is enjoying a renaissance at the moment... and fair play to him. i always liked his image and his acting ability in such fare as angel heart and johnny handsome. you know what you are going to get with rourke - mean, moody, dirty. but this film gives you much more - and you don't want most of it.first and foremost - this whole thing just doesn't make sense. rourke is a hardened ira killer who after killing a bus-load of schoolchildren flees ireland for london. he is on the run from the cops and from his own army comrades. he has also vowed to never kill again. it looks like the bus full of kids finally did it for him.however, when he gets to london he is tracked down by a local mobster (bates - looking like his eyebrows and hair came straight off a burton's dummy) to kill his main competitor in turn for £50,000 and a boat trip to the us. rourke reluctantly agrees to do it but is seen by a priest (hoskins) and confesses the crime to him in the confessional in order to keep the priest's mouth shut. he figures it is better than killing him.a wealth of things arise here which just don't add up : 1. why pick rourke to off your competition? as is illustrated by a scene whereby an employee is pinned to a wall by a couple of heavies with what look like awls - these london guys are tough enough anyway to do their own killing.2. not only that but the mobster gets a guy to follow rourke and witness the killing with his own eyes. why didn't that guy simply kill the competitor and save all the hassle of dealing with rourke? 3.hoskins sees the murder take place and the police let him go off - without protection, i may add - to take confession? no way.4. rourke hangs around the church (right next to where he carried out the murder ) immediately after the crime takes place to go to confession. why aren't the cops checking the place out? 5. rourke hangs around the church and hoskin's blind niece in particular, for days afterward without anybody bothering him. what? he's on the run and he stays put by the very place where he committed another murder? stupid.6. the cops actually meet rourke in the church "fixing" the organ and have no idea who he is. do they not know he is on the run for the school bus bombing? they don't even check up on him? 7. why get rourke to kill for you, and then tell him to wait around for a few days to get on the boat? you'd think you'd want to get rid of him immediately. or kill him. one or the other? 8. why does bates' brother suddenly decide to rape the blind niece in the midst of all the waiting? could he not restrain himself for a few days? at least until rourke has been safely offed to the states? ridiculous.9. rourke suddenly has inner turmoil after all his years of killing and wins over the blind niece immediately - even after she knows he is a killer, she still loves him? again - utterly ludicrous. and besides - she falls in "love" with him in record time - a few days !!!! 10. the whole bomb thing at the end is just plain silly from bates' point of view.11. things happen in parts of this film that just do not make sense or are simply in there to help the storyline (and i say that in jest) along. bates' houses rourke in a whorehouse until the boat is ready to sail and rourke suddenly displays a moral high ground to respect the whore in the house - but yet will bed a blind girl.12. rourke asks a henchman on the boat where bates is - and the henchman practically spurts out the entire movements of his boss in less than 10 seconds. it was embarrassing - the guy was telling rourke far more than he even asked.13. hoskin's priest is an ex-army guy and we see him beat up three henchmen behind a pub. totally uncalled-for and yet another cringe-worthy scene.i'm gonna stop there at unlucky 13 without mentioning rourke's hair (so falsely red it is laughable), his accent (which to be fair is not too bad sometimes but deteriorates to a barely heard mumble at other times), his clothes, walk, looks to the heavens etc. nor will i mention the music and the choppy editing style.oooppps - i have just mentioned them.overall - a disaster of a film with some obvious religious imagery thrown in (rourke on the cross, preaching from a pulpit) which would embarrass a first year film student never mind a top star and director.4/10.

oh my god! after having such a promising start, critters 2 reiterated the karmic rule of what goes around comes around. clearly, very few things were thought out when this movie was made, and what was up with scott grimes wearing an earing! this should have been the last expedition into the critters saga, but more garbage was on its way. this was the big reason why i didn't watch critters 3, and why is every bad film series has to have an episode in space? (critters, friday the 13th, leprechaun in space, hellraiser, etc.)

some changes for the better (the special effects are more elaborate), some for the worse (scott grimes, a likable kid in the original, has turned into an awkward teenager), but generally this sequel is about on a par with the original - which doesn't say much. the pg-13 rating is questionable; although the film is not scary at all, there is some brief but quite explicit gore, and some out-of-place nudity. (*1/2)

what a terrible sequel. the reason i give this film two stars instead of zero because it's a movie that has violence and gore and critters, yet it is planned out poorly. and this god-awful sequel was done by none other than bum-bum-bum-bum!!!!!!!!! mick garris! the bonehead that brought you the remake of the shining which nearly got kubrick to nearly roll in his grave when he discovered it was actually made. garris is also the man that brought you the sad sequel of the fly, the fly, which was a wonderful movie, but garris's movie nearly ruined john getz career. anyway, if you really want to see the crappy critters trilogy in order, don't. that's the mistake i made, rent the first one or the third one or better yet don't stoop to that level at all! this movie sucked so bad that i can't believe it, please avoid this crap. shame on you, mick!

two years after leaving the small town of grover's bend due to encountering the krites, brad brown returns to spend time with his grandmother in time for easter. meanwhile the krite eggs begin to hatch. as they cause trouble in the town, brown & the townsfolk, as well as the alien bounty hunters who have returned to finish the creatures must fight the bloodthirsty furballs before they wipe out the town.the original critters was a minor attempt to rip-off the family-horror flick "gremlins". it became a cult favourite on the video shelves & was successful enough to warrant a sequel. this sequel plays down the horror & makes its entire focus comedy instead. unfortunately the comedy part is extremely clumsy, as well as childish. the acting is on par with the rest of the film. it is just that the film suffers from a weak script. the visual effects are fairly well done.grade: d+ review by m. k. geist.

1st watched 7/29/2001 - 4 out of 10 (dir-mark dindal): fast-paced, frantic animation effort by ted turner's feature animation group plays a lot like tv cartoons and leaves a lot to be desired in the area of likeable characters, but definetly has extremely unlikeable villains. i'm not even sure why the kids would like this movie because there are so many references to old movie stars that kids know very little or nothing about. mediocre effort at best despite raves on the box comparing it to disney efforts like aladdin and lion king. don't let this fool you -- there is no comparison in story or quality.

this movie didn't do it for me, an avid snl fan for the past 14 years. jamie gertz' portrayal was ok, but there was something so off-putting about the movie itself. the facts presented in the movie are totally skewed. but merv griffin produced it, so that would explain a lot. he was never on snl, nor had anything to do with it. the points in her life when she was on snl are backwards. when we first see her on snl, walking through the studio with lorne michaels, the logo on the wall is circa 1988-1989, not 1975. and let's talk about the cast -- who are these people?? i have never heard of a one of them. truly dissatisfying. this movie shows why tv movies are just that, tv movies.

i enjoy science-fiction just as much as the next man but what the hell was that? apparently shot over just three days using excess film stock left over from his previous film, 'nana (1926),' this jean renoir short is a bewildering futuristic satire, produced on a budget that couldn't have been much more than zero. in the year 2028, following a great war, africa has become the most civilised region on earth, and what was formerly europe has been designated "terres inconnues (unknown land)." an african explorer  played by johnny huggins, a black man dressed up as a white man dressed up as a black man, if you follow me  travels to the ruins of paris in his spherical aircraft, and lands outside the lair of a parisian savage (catherine hessling, then the director's wife) and her primate companion, perhaps the creepiest ape-man costume i've ever seen. the savage, as part of some bizarre sexual initiation ritual, starts showing the explorer the charleston dance, which he is delighted to learn himself.it doesn't help the film that hessling, who was wonderful the following year in renoir's 'the little match girl (1928),' isn't much of a dancer, though the extensive use of slow-motion adds a touch of surrealism to the ceremony. furthermore, i'm quite shocked that renoir would exploit his own wife as such a blatant sexual object  it doesn't come as a surprise to learn of their divorce just three years later! on the plus side, i did like the general sci-fi concept behind the film, and the slyly satiric touch of the reversing the racial roles usually typical in such stories as this. however, why renoir decided to dress up his black actor as a minstrel will remain a mystery for all of time. silly, crude and quite pointless, 'charleston parade (1927)' is a cinematic oddity from one of cinema's most respected directors, and is perhaps an effort that he would have liked to forget. the dvd version came without a musical soundtrack, but i compromised with a selection of pieces from dmitri shostakovich.

made with film stock left over from the production of nana, 1927's sur un air de charleston is described as a holiday film for all concerned, and that's the best way to view it. jean renoir seems never to have thought enough of it to even edit the footage together. the plot is a simple reversion of racial stereotypes  in 2028 a black explorer travels to a post-holocaust paris where a white native girl teaches him the charleston (naturally he assumes she's a savage whose dancing is a prelude to her eating him before giving in to the seductive beat of 'white aborigine' music). there are plenty of surreal touches, be it the pet gorilla eating the flowers in catherine hessling's hair, the angels the girl telephones (renoir and producer pierre braunberger among them) or the fact that black performer johnny huggins plays his part in minstrel blackface while hessling's dancing ability is almost completely nonexistent, and there are some interesting occasional experiments with slow motion, but there's not really enough to sustain it for two reels. an additional air of surrealism is provided by the fact that this silent musical has absolutely no score at all on lions gate's new dvd

a man in blackface lands in a spaceship and meets a girl who lives in some sort of shack with a monkey. he hooks her up with a telephone, and she teaches him how to charleston. then they fly off in the spaceship, leaving the monkey behind. cringe-inducing blackface aside, this short film makes no sense. i think that's the plot, but i'm not sure by a long shot. you can't tell that this is renoir at work, despite his characteristic humanism. good use of slow-motion, though. can be found on the ny film annex's series of experimental film videos, no. 18, i believe.

this is the worst movie i have ever seen and believe me i've sen a lot of bad movies. i love cheeesy horror but this was just terrible. there was not one scene in this film where i felt scared. all the actors must have been people that they found at a bus stop 20 minutes prior to shooting. i wish that blockbutser would have given me my 99 cents back. the acting was terrible. the writing was incredibly bad. someone had to screen this movie before it was released and had to know that it was terrible. i'd be embarrassed to have my name associated with this monstrosity. don't rent this movie. if you do, don't return it so no other poor souls will ever make the mistake of renting it.

our story: two u.s. navy deep sea divers search for silver coins hidden beneath the ocean off the filipino coast. our proof: extremely dull entertainment at its best, with no plot in sight. jim brown is completely wasted, provided his help in producing this 70s war turkey. richard jaeckel is in his usual form. don cornelius and richard pryor are among those who gave special thanks in their contributions! bombs away!!!

i just saw this movie and it turns out to be pretty lame just as mentioned by other user reviews and the one thing that bothered me the most was the southern accent some of the characters had, it took place in wisconsin, not the south. as mentioned from other reviews, ed geine wasn't a big dude, so why did the guy that plays jason and leatherface portray him?i fast forwarded through most of it being that there are many slow parts. hopefully someone will do their homework on ed geine and the town and make a more accurate movie

as far as asian horror goes, i have seen my share of disappointments along with some of the creepiest sh*t imaginable... "acacia" doesn't really qualify for either of those categories. it had a few moments of tension and was interesting to watch, yet i couldn't help think that there should have been a tad more to this story. the film deals with a childless couple who decide to adopt a kid who appears to have a fascination with trees. he develops a bond with the acacia tree in their yard and seems to communicate with it. then, during a fight with his mother involving their new birth child, he storms off after threatening to find his dead mother who is now a tree. when he doesn't come back, the parents send file a report and wait, while the neighbor girl believes he somehow inhabits the acacia tree. the pacing is rather slow and the ending gets a bit weird, but i have to recommend this as a slightly enjoyable effort, though the story feels a little flat. hell, i can't really make up my mind on this...

this flick is a waste of time.i expect from an action movie to have more than 2 explosions and some shooting.van damme's acting is awful. he never was much of an actor, but here it is worse.he was definitely better in his earlier movies. his screenplay part for the whole movie was probably not more than one page of stupid nonsense one liners.the whole dialog in the film is a disaster, same as the plot.the title "the shepherd" makes no sense. why didn't they just call it "border patrol"? the fighting scenes could have been better, but either they weren't able to afford it, or the fighting choreographer was suffering from lack of ideas.this is a cheap low type of action cinema.

this movie is essentially a "how-to" on how to be a well-connected pedophile. i'm amazed that so many people-- especially other gay men-- have seen this movie and read the book and no one has brought up the fact that if weber was not an influential photographer, he would be in jail, doing time for child abuse. poor peter johnson. weber took this poor, naive (although incredibly handsome) teenager whom he found at a training camp for high school wrestlers in the midwest, brought him to live in his home, and took thousands of homoerotic photos of him, many of them full-frontal nudes, all through johnson's teenage years. that ain't art. it's child abuse. and what's worse, weber made lots of money off of it, and poor johnson is going to have serious "issues" the rest of his life. weber's lecherous love of the boy is downright creepy, as are his ramblings about famous (and not so famous) people he's known, as he tries to complete johnson's "education." creepy, and then just plain boring. the only redeeming thing i can say about the movie is that it is a fascinating study of self-deception. but i can't help but wonder why no one ever considered the effect this was having on "chop suey" (weber's nickname for johnson) himself.

there are interesting pieces here of and about bruce weber's likes and dislikes. maybe if a professional editor had put it together for biography, i would have felt more satisfied. instead, i spent $8 at a film festival on it. for an autobiography, almost nothing is revealed about bruce weber, other than he likes to look at photographs, shoot interesting people, especially beautiful teenage boys, and listen to jazz. the director of "crumb" would have made a much more interesting and cohesive film.

if you can stomach the campiness, this movie should make you laugh out loud several times. it did for me, at least. i'll only mention one of my favorite elements: the "underwater shots" of the "fish" "swimming". the sound which accompanies those shots is great too.one last note: william katt is actually a pretty decent actor. i hope he gets another day in the sun; watching him as "the greatest american hero" was a fun part of my childhood a couple of decades ago, and he hasn't been very visible since. he seemed kind of depressed in this movie. somebody give him a fun job on a good show, or something.

this movie is one of the worst remakes i have ever seen in my life! the acting is laughable and corman has not improved his piranhas any since 1978. 90% of the special effects are lifted from piranha (1978), up from the depths (1979) and humanoids from the deep (1979). it makes piranha ii: the spawning look like it belongs on the american film institute list.

i think that this was one of the most trite films ever made. no redeeming features at all. even my 12-year-old son said it was laughable. may be a good candidate for the next generation of "mystery science theatre."

i guess my biggest mistake was to watch this remake of '95 "piranha" back-to-back with joe dante's '78 original. i did the same last week with "the omen". curiously enough, watching the remake right after the '76 original, really made me appreciate the 2006 version quite a bit for various reasons.but this approach sort of backfired on the '95 piranha version. it enhanced the fact that it really is a lesser picture. basically, the '95 version is more or less the exact same film, as it tells the same story and follows it practically scene-by-scene (only barabara steele's character and the military intervention were written out of it). but the cinematography wasn't as good. the acting was worse too. especially alexandra paul (playing heather menzies' character) showed me again what a horrible actress she is. bradford dillman (from the '78 version) had his charlton heston way of acting going, which was amusing, while in the '95 version william katt does a good job at being william katt. so i didn't mind him, really. but the whole cast is pretty much inferior and the only worthwhile event was spotting james karen ("return of the living dead", parts 1 & 2) in a cameo. john carl buechler's make-up effects aren't as neat as rob bottin's. the musical score had some ring to it, but pino donaggio's score was much more memorable in the original. so all these shortcomings really shone through with having just re-watched the original as part of this double bill.since scott p. levy's remake does follow dante's original, i guess it is entertaining enough to sit through, though it's lacking the wit dante's original had. but what really made me not like levy's version very much, is the fact that quite a bit of stock footage from the first film was re-used during the piranha attack scenes. i never like it when filmmakers do this (and i'm not talking about using footage for flashbacks or other valid reasons). i mean, if you don't have the budget (or imagination) to come up with newly shot material, then for pete's sake, don't do a frickin' remake. but roger corman produced this (cheaper) remake, so i guess i shouldn't be all that surprised about the re-use of footage.if you do decide to watch "piranha", then make sure it's been a while since you've seen the original. you might enjoy this remake a little more then. and oh yes, that cool little stop-motion creature from the original is nowhere to be found in this film, as to be expected. but what's worse, there also isn't any female nudity in this one (the original really had quite some titty-shots going for it, and that blonde girl from the opening-scene even accidentally pulled her underwear a bit down too far when removing her jeans!). figures, as this '95 version was made for tv.

well, i thought the movie was blah 1/10.anyways the best part is the first 5 minutes of the film with the nerd's or whatever girlfriend, this is the part u guys watch out for tho she had big hooters, i thought is that really a random actor? heck no, it wasn't it was actually a model by the name of larissa mccomas but u already knew thatso, that made sense but that was about it rest of the film (that i saw anyway) didn't care 4, and didn't bother watching the rest of it that'sall i needed to c to be satisfied so 2 those of u that just care for that well there u go enjoy

honestly awful film, bad editing, awful lighting, dire dialog and scrappy screenplay.the lighting at is so bad there's moments you can't even see what's going on, i even tried to playing with the contrast and brightness so i could see something but that didn't help.they must have found the script in a bin, the character development is just as awful and while you hardly expect much from a jean-claude van damme film this one manages to hit an all time low. you can't even laugh at the cheesy'ness.the directing and editing are also terrible, the whole film follows an extremely tired routine and fails at every turn as it bumbles through the plot that is so weak it's just unreal.there's not a lot else to say other than it's really bad and nothing like jean-claude van damme's earlier work which you could enjoy.avoid like the plaque, frankly words fail me in condemning this "film".

okay they tell you it's real. they don't list any screenwriters or directors, but one viewing of this movie will prove to anyone - it's not real in the way you were hoping for. the speaking rarely sounds like real natural talk...but also down not sound to be scripted. (possibly loosely scripted). to me it sounded much more like they were always trying to ad-lib. (which they almost always did poorly). therefore, they knew they were making a 'movie', not just collecting real natural footage. so i'm sure these people knew what was going on, knew they had certain spots to look for things that were set up...and they were just told to ad-lib around it all.*************'major spoilers'**************** *****************************************okay, it's so lame. every item, spot or thing that could be strange or use d as a scare, is magically stumbled upon by these people. let me list off the ridiculously obviously faked things that happened that i remember:1) less than 2 minutes of entering the house, they turn a light switch on - the light sparks and a chandelier almost falls on a guy.2) they happen to find an old medical bag with a bloody butcher knife* in it, while exploring the cellar.3) they hear a noise in an armoire, so they open the door slowly - bam - a cat happens to be in there and jumps straight at the camera while shrieking.4) then they happen to notice there is a hole in the wall, so let's stick our hand in...wow, they pulled out a doll of a baby wrapped in mummy tape.5) let's go to the attic, uh-oh it feels 'heavy' up here....boom - a chair flies across the room.6) time to eat. oh no ! the girl that was scared of bugs had a roach in her sandwich ! lol !....ridiculous.7) let's get out the ouija board...oops one of the legs on the planchette fell off the side of the board. that couldn't be because the people were pushing it could it ? (they find out a ghost there is named charles)8) wait ! what was that noise in the chimney...clink - oh my shackles fell out "i think she* kept people up here".9) now wimpy girl is going to brave looking up the chimney shaft...oh, what's this she sees something...and is asking people who aren't looking up the chimney what it is. swish - it falls off straight at her. (perfect camera shot) she moves just in time. it was more chain.10) now we have to separate and each 'cleanse' our designated rooms - wouldn't it be something if things started happening one by one to these people now...okay:chick #1: wow, suddenly her room is shaking...but no one elses does.dude #1: actually says to himself "charles, is that you charles...it can't be you because you're just a figment of my imagination aren't you charles". well guess what, he gets knocked over and dragged across the floor. another lucky camera shot.chick #2: hears things..try to communicate ...and is standing there getting abrasions or something.dude #2: he was in the attic, reached his arm through a hole in the floor and got a splinter....i don't remember what else.11) dude #2 runs, gets chick #2...they hear chick and dude #1 screaming...they find them chained to a wall and strapped to a table.(*) they leave. cut to black. final text tell us they escaped safely, were treated for minor cuts. they have since had nightmares and insomnia, we also find out the next day a 911 call was made by they name a someone named "charles".*************'major spoilers'**************** ******************over********************okay, when i first heard this movie was being made, i couldn't wait. i thought it was going to be real. real, real. - and more professional, with more professional type people. i love the idea of this type of thing, i'd love to see real haunting footage. before this movie was released i saw couple reviews of it by people online. they both claimed how fake it was and how stupid the people were.. time passed i forgot about the film....then i realized it was never released at theaters. so i found out it went straight to video, rented it....found that every brutal review was completely true. it's too bad, i really wanted this to be good.random thought: the house didn't seem to have tvs, radios..kitchen appliances that i recall...which would make me think no one has lived there for a long time. especially the house is truly known for being haunted...im pretty sure no one lives there. but it looks so clean and tidy...and what was a cat doing there ? the property does not have near by neighbors....all-in-all, you'll only want to rent this if you and your friends wanna sit there and make fun of it...or if you heard about it a long time ago and it intrigued you. (you will will be disappointed if you are expecting a good film...or real film)random thought: i believe the producer says "the 'footage' you see is real". well technically it is real footage isn't it ? real footage of fake hauntings ? maybe that was his loop hole.i give this this movie one star - strictly on the fact that they told the story of madame lalaurie. a real new orleans story.the best performance was by the guy who teaches the participants about the ghost hunting equipment in the beginning. he was obviously actually real...or a good actor.

i was surprised that the makers of this movie actually came out said that this movie was a true story. the majority of the scenes looked fake to me. for instance when the one girl was eating her sandwich and there was a roach in it. while she was eating the sandwich the camera on the opposite side of it showed that there was a roach on it. it's funny how the camera just happened to be filming on the sandwich when the girl was eating it. another scene is when the gang went to open a clothes closet and a cat flew out of the closet or should i say it was thrown out to give it effect. this movie was not realistic at all. it's highly doubtful that the events that happened were true that evening when the "st. francisville experiment" took place. i believe that the house may be haunted, but not on the night this movie was filmed! the ending was amusing when tim and and other girl were chained down in the some sort of basement. paul and madison found them and rescued them! i would rather watch the blair witch project again then have to sit through the st. francisville experiment movie again. as i said, if the makers of the movie did not state that this was a true story with true events i may have like it more. your better off getting more entertainment from the blair witch project (even though this is not a true story either)!!!

the characters are annoying, immature, and flaky....madison being the most annoying of all. ooh...a cold spot! such a dire threat! any ghost in that house would have fled in self-defense! to make a long story short, this movie is boring. seeing a chair flying across a room may be creepy, but that's about as intriguing as it gets. i watched it once and when one of my kids wanted to watch it again, i was tempted to take a baseball bat to the tv set rather than watch this rubbish again. if you want a good horror movie or even a passable comedy, this isn't it! the only good part of the whole thing was "the roach scene" and, by the end of the movie, you ended up feeling sorry for the roach!

this film was really terrible.however , it's worth seeing , as it features the worlds most unnecessarily extended sex scene ever. i mean , this thing went on for about 7 - 8 minutes (repeating the same 'moves' over and over), thats almost 10 % of the whole film! i haven't laughed as hard as i laughed at that for a long time.there were some seriously strange and pointless goings on in this film, but the one that i found funniest was when (for no reason whatsoever) a helicopter lands and 5 or 6 guys in orange suits run in to the complex near the end. 2 minutes later they run out again. what the hell was that for?? also , the tiny white forklift that magically changed into a huge yellow digger was pretty classic. i'm led to beleive that this is because they used footage from the 'carnosaur' trilogy to patch up this absolute donkey. i'm gonna have to see those now!the film is worth watching for a laugh or two , but if you dont find bad movies funny, stay away!

i am a huge eric roberts fan, i collect his movies and so far has get to 60. but i´m honest to say that sometimes he really makes awful movies. but hey that´s why i like him - he is entertaining.but this one has to take the price, i can´t stop wonder why. somehow they managed to get eric and also corbin bernsen to the picture.while bernsen is plain awful (i really don´t like him), roberts manage to be the best thing in the movie (and that doesn´t mean much). he practically do it on routine basis.the female lead (brasselle) looks like a plastic doll and acts like one to. and tim abell and his crew looks like action-man plastic dolls and acts like those to.the plot is really embarrasing. i haven´t seen any of the carnosaur movies so i can´t recall on the footage that has been added from there, but it explains some things. but still there are holes huge as craters in the plot.spoilers alertthe first attacks are located outside the laboratory in the woods nearby. but at the end they blow the whole laboratory in pieces and just relax that everything is over, but they forgot about the ones outside??????when the helicopter pilot is eaten alive i wonder how she couldn´t notice a t-rex climbing into the chopper????the guys in orange overalls is my favourite - what are they doing, out for a jogging round or what??of course there are a b-movie standard sex-scene with silicon titties involved too. this time it´s lorissa mccomas that greets us. i don´t have any problem with that (she looks awful) but to look at a guy squeezing tits and being on the verge of climax for 8!!!! minutes is just tooo long.shame on you all (including eric roberts) - now i look forward to watch con games (i wonder???)

the only reason there is a question mark in parenthesis is not because i haven't seen every film released in 2001 thus far. it's because this film was only made partly in 2001. the rest of it was stolen from roger corman's other dinosaur films, carnosaur 1-3.i have a confession to make. "carnosaur 2" is perhaps one of my favorite b-movies. it borrows so much from james cameron's "aliens" it's not even funny. but i love it. i can't explain exactly why. it just works for me. i liked the sets, i liked the cinematography, i liked how they borrowed from "aliens". it's all a bit ironic that cameron at one point was an understudy of corman's, with films like "battle beyond the stars" (1980).i own the carnosaur trilogy on dvd, and the most i can say for part one is that it has moments. the most i can say for the third is that it took me five years to find it watchable.now we have "raptor," which does not continue that series. instead, it borrows entire scenes from the carnosaur trilogy and builds a movie around it. and somehow roger corman was able to get eric roberts and corbin bernsen to do it. now, i'm not saying either roberts or bernsen are at any kind of career high. but they were both at one point what could be called respectable actors. not here. sure, actors react to effects they won't even see while filming all the time. here, however, they are reacting to mismatched footage from films that are between five and eight years old. there's even a sherrif whose costume was modeled directly after a character in "carnosaur 1." apparently it made too much sense to get the original guy back.when "raptor" was announced i was a wee bit excited. i was however disappointed when corman said that they'd be using the old dinosaur models from "carnosaur." apparently corman decided after this interview was conducted that he wouldn't even do that. and its not that he couldn't find an fx crew to do it. the script for this was clearly written keeping in mind that the story had to be built around pre-existing stock footage.don't compare this to ed wood. ed did better than this. at least he only used the stock footage of bela once, in one film. there are ways of incorporating stock footage into a movie, and "raptor" takes this frowned-upon technique to a new low. even if you liked "carnosaur 3: primal species," stay away from "raptor."

technically i'am a van damme fan, or i was. this movie is so bad that i hated myself for wasting those 90 minutes. do not let the name isaac florentine (undisputed ii) fool you, i had big hopes for this one, depending on what i saw in (undisputed ii), man.. was i wrong ??! all action fans wanted a big comeback for the classic action hero, but i guess we wont be able to see that soon, as our hero keep coming with those (going -to-a-border - far-away-town-and -kill -the-bad-guys- than-comeback- home) movies i mean for god's sake, we are in 2008, and they insist on doing those disappointing movies on every level. why ??!!! do your self a favor, skip it.. seriously.

the shanghai cobra starts out like gangbusters, with a rain soaked diner scene straight out of shack out on 101 or gun crazy (the first one). unfortunately the film then proceeds to plod its weary way through a standard chan formula that is only barely enlivened by the always wonderful mantan moreland. it's as if director karlson blew half his budget in the first five minutes, just getting the set up the way he wanted it. watch the beginning and think about the phenix city story.

admittedly, i am not a fan of the monogram chan films. . the plot, involving radium theft from a bank vault, is a bit far fetched and a long way from the atmospheric mysteries that fox produced. mantan moreland and benson fong (as no. 3 son tommy) provide some laughs as usual. but otherwise there isn't much here. great title that is wasted.

it actually pains me to say it, but this movie was horrible on every level. the blame does not lie entirely with van damme as you can see he tried his best, but let's face it, he's almost fifty, how much more can you ask of him? i find it so hard to believe that the same people who put together undisputed 2; arguably the best (western) martial arts movie in years, created this. everything from the plot, to the dialog, to the editing, to the overall acting was just horribly put together and in many cases outright boring and nonsensical. scott adkins who's fight scenes seemed more like a demo reel, was also terribly underused and not even the main villain which is such a shame because 1) he is more than capable of playing that role and 2) the actual main villain was not only not intimidating at all but also quite annoying. again, not blaming van damme. i will always be a fan, but avoid this one.

isaac florentine has made some of the best western martial arts action movies ever produced. in particular us seals 2, cold harvest, special forces and undisputed 2 are all action classics. you can tell isaac has a real passion for the genre and his films are always eventful, creative and sharp affairs, with some of the best fight sequences an action fan could hope for. in particular he has found a muse with scott adkins, as talented an actor and action performer as you could hope for. this is borne out with special forces and undisputed 2, but unfortunately the shepherd just doesn't live up to their abilities.there is no doubt that jcvd looks better here fight-wise than he has done in years, especially in the fight he has (for pretty much no reason) in a prison cell, and in the final showdown with scott, but look in his eyes. jcvd seems to be dead inside. there's nothing in his eyes at all. it's like he just doesn't care about anything throughout the whole film. and this is the leading man.there are other dodgy aspects to the film, script-wise and visually, but the main problem is that you are utterly unable to empathise with the hero of the film. a genuine shame as i know we all wanted this film to be as special as it genuinely could have been. there are some good bits, mostly the action scenes themselves. this film had a terrific director and action choreographer, and an awesome opponent for jcvd to face down. this could have been the one to bring the veteran action star back up to scratch in the balls-out action movie stakes.sincerely a shame that this didn't happen.

i'll preface my review by stating that i am not a fan of the independent 'straight to video' genre that owes a great debt to the grindhouse films of the 60's. i don't own any, i've never rented any, so i might lack the appreciation for these tongue-in-cheek, low-budget stinkers that many other people have.i caught this movie on cinemax late one saturday evening with a lady friend. please don't ask me why i was watching cinemax late one saturday evening with a lady friend. we were bored with world championship poker. some atrociously bad acting courtesy of misty mundae (and i wish she wouldn't own up to being from illinois, as we actually turn out some very bright thespians here) caught our attention. now normally, the aim of some good soft-core porn would be to get you and your partner in the mood. some good sex, tongue in cheek humor, and who know what could happen? after about 15 minutes, and a scene where the title character seduces a mugging victim, my lady friend said 'if you want to watch the rest of this fine, i am going to bed so i don't have to. please turn the volume off.' here is what i gather from the plot: misty's character is a sexless nerd who gets bitten by a spider and turns into a super-sex kitten with super web slinging powers that don't come from her wrists. there is some sort of evil villainess involved, who didn't look particularly evil or sexy. spiderbabe saves the day, has sex, m.j. (who is male in this film) constantly gets propositioned by stereotypically bad gay bikers, and somehow the evil villainess gets pushed off a building to her death.what was good about this film? it ended.what was bad about it? acting to make a third grade pageant look like oscar winners, a script turned out by people who i picture to be drunken, college-aged sex perverts who wouldn't know what sex is if they took a class taught by dr. ruth, special effects that were about as special as someone jumping off a trampoline, humor about as funny as well, i have yet to encounter anything that is lamer. the sex scenes? if we were watching a video, the only thing those scenes would have turned on is the fast forward button. and the action scenes? some of my old atari vcs games had better choreography.now i know this type of film is supposed to be enjoyed for it's inherent badness. companies like ei don't set out to make good movies: they have a niche and they target it. my experience as a marketer tells me they are right on the money in servicing their audience. but after my brief exposure to 'spiderbabe', i for one can say i am not delving into that world again any time soon. maybe the problem with the filmmakers in this type of genre is this: they spend so much attention to making the films bad, that if they made an effort to try and focus on those things they do very well, they would turn out some very enjoyable 'le bad' cinema, a la troma films in the 80's. sorry folks; the spirit is there, but the effort isn't.though i have to admit that "alice in acidland" intrigues me

sure, this film was retarded. but you expected that the moment you looked at the cover-box. it's a b movie, and on the t&a factor this movie delivered. truthfully, it was funnier than expected. while it was by no means a work of comedic genius, like "the party animal" or "orgazmo", as far as b movies go it was worth the watch, if you're into that sort of thing anyway.christians and morally-oriented parental groups, this is soft-core adult entertainment. if you don't want your children watching sexual content and nudity, then you should keep your children away from this film.

first of all i dunno if i was supposed to use my imagination in this film or the director was trying to save money or low on budget! here we go....basically there were so many years and gaps that i don't understand, its like the movie was jumping from 9 years to 20 years to 30 and so much gaps that makes you ask questions how the hell did this happen? and why? i think this is a big flow. forget the reviews who keeps whining about the history , this movie doesn't have only history facts issues, but also has so many flaws. so most of the people keep saying watch this in cinema you will lose all cinematography like rivers, deserts etc.. thats true they are beautiful thats why i waited for bluray release 1080p. ok! beautiful scenes but whats the point of that? i turned off the movie after 1 hour and half, i just lost interest. the movie kept on doing the exact same things jumping in years ( at least mr. director put for example, after 2 years after 10 years!) i mean i couldn't watch the movie i lost understanding of whats going on! anyways i wish i could include spoilers but when u decide to watch this movie, just ask yourself how did this happen? you will know what i mean! don't watch this movie its a waste of time.

for native mongolian speakers the film lacked emotion and emphasis. used too many non native speakers especially jamukha. too many diversions from the actual history. terrible terrible subtitle!!! i wonder where and who did that subtitle. it was both in english and thai. i wonder how bad the subtitle was in thai if the english subtitle was soooo bad! described the one of the greatest leader's life very uninteresting. there are better films made by mongolian directors with very low budget from 1980's. honestly, i'm wondering if the film critics of academy award is that lenient or what? only good thing was some good cgi in some fighting scenes only moderately... not over the top cgi

this film did not excite me. while on vacation in turkey i noticed that it was playing at the local cinema and decided to take the chance to go see it. the action sequences in the film are well choreographed, however, the story drags during the middle of the film.one thing that i did not quite follow is how borte was able to get the money to bribe the guards.the other thing that i did not particularly like was the missing segment of khan's life. it did not go into detail as to how the bad guys were able to find him and re-imprison him after he had gone missing for so long. overall, i rate this movie a (4) because i enjoyed the action sequences, but they were too few to justify a higher rating as the dialog left me less than impressed...

i had high hopes for this one until they changed the name to 'the shepherd : border patrol, the lamest movie name ever, what was wrong with just 'the shepherd'. this is a by the numbers action flick that tips its hat at many classic van damme films. there is a nice bit of action in a bar which reminded me of hard target and universal soldier but directed with no intensity or flair which is a shame. there is one great line about 'being p*ss drunk and carrying a rabbit' and some ok action scenes let down by the cheapness of it all. a lot of the times the dialogue doesn't match the characters mouth and the stunt men fall down dead a split second before even being shot. the end fight is one of the better van damme fights except the director tries to go a bit too john woo and fails also introducing flashbacks which no one really cares about just gets in the way of the action which is the whole point of a van damme film.not good, not bad, just average generic action.

this movie is one that belongs on the cutting room floor. for one, the opening sequence does not put forth the element of 'gang' related subject. if it wasn't supposed to then at least they got that part right. secondly...whats with all the glancing to the left and then to the right??? they even do it in synchronous style. nowhere have i witnessed a member from a rival crew walk up to a bar, look for someone, from the outside lookin like he is all that and a bag o chips at a barbie and walk away without even being confronted let alone get 'what for'. i wasted money on the rental price and am glad i did not purchase the dvd itself.if this was made by college( t.a.f.e ) students then at least they gave it the old aussie try. better luck next time.

i love watching australian movies but this steaming pile of crap was just plain embarrassing. the dvd cover looked promising but you know what they say, don't judge a dvd by it's cover. i also noticed that it won best actor for an award but the competition must have been really bad because the acting in this film is pathetic. it just seemed that the director thought he had enough talent to direct and act when he should really focus on one part of film-making and get it right before spreading himself too thin. the music was pretty ordinary. the story really didn't go anywhere. it was just a sequence of fights strung together with poor script and cheesy dialogue.i will say this to all aspiring filmmakers though. watch this film. it will give you hope that your film will win something at some festival.however, good on them for getting in there and having a go. hope they learned some lessons and their next venture is a little better.

although i watched this film by myself(thankfully), i still felt embarrassed while watching it. i was tricked into renting it by the reviews on the front cover, and the bloody/gritty camera stills on the back-which led me to believe it was some sort of documentary. these actors are laughable throughout the entire film, not convincing at all. the story involves an italian australian(?) gang, just fighting other gangs, and then running,fighting,repeat. supposedly they train extremely hard, which makes them way better than other gangs. for some reason i don't believe that they could actually beat up some of these other guys that are twice their size. i could be wrong... no i'm not wrong, this movie is not enjoyable on any level.the jail montage looked like it was a summer camp, just instead of kids, it was a sausage fest of horrible actors, just hanging out and laughing and trying to look hard. this movie is not worth your time, save your money, or throw it in the garbage, just don't waste it on this movie.

for those of you who don't remember movies -- http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080120/ -- this came out in '79 ( i guess enough time has gone by so naturally nunzio figured he could just redo this and say he wrote it - yea, right! ).the acting in this is way overboard - the "tough guys" walk around with their shoulders hunched forward to give the impression they are bigger than they really are, also the "hero' seems to have a passion for snorting, and rolling his eyes in a bug-eyed kind of way to express angst/anger to the celluloid eye.there is a sort of racial message here, from the sicilian perspective (mind you this is about 3rd generation down the line... the original "wogs" arrived in oz after the war and during my childhood - yep i'm an aussie. so the "wogg-iness" has been diluted a lot - they even sound like true-blue aussies - not a flicker of the "dago accent" anywhere ( there, there's another slang for ya, nun! )maori's with sunnies (sunglasses) at 4am - must be cool to be sun-blinded in the middle of the night and it looks like redfern... this is at this movie's tedious end. nunzio tried to copy the flavor of the warriors but, left too many holes in the story. how about coincidences ?the warriors had a gang of baseball guys wielding bats, with white face makeup chase the heroes to a train station and fight them - nunzios gang get chased on a railway station by a gang of stick wielding guys wearing whitish face masks. the warriors were mistakenly accused of shooting/murdering another gang-member -- nunzios gang are mistakenly accused of raping the sister of the big maori gang boss. the warriors are lured into a room by a gang of girls who attack them - nunzios crowd want to crash at a friends house, which is populated by, yep, a gang of girls -- there are almost too many copies from the warriors to keep on about here.i am saddened that people don't want to see other moves from oz because of this tripe - how about mad max - commander and master of the world? not all movies are made by actors who are so bad, they have to fund their own movies. as far as the other actors in this show are concerned, they seem to have taken their cue from "the nun" as they all are as bad as each other - don't bother with this movie! i can't get my money back - so save yours!

let's face it, a truly awful movie, no...i mean a "truly" awful movie, is a rare, strange, and beautiful thing to behold. i admite that there is a special place in my heart for films like plan 9 from outer space, half caste, species, etc. and although i'm giving this film a 1, i highly urge anyone who enjoys a bad film for what it truly is (a bad film) to find a friend, snacks, something to drink, and make the special occasion it deserves out of: aussie park boyz. from the very first moments of the lead actor's side to side eye-rolling performance as he attempts to inject intensity directly into the film without ever looking at a camera (a slice of ham straight out of silent pictures--eat your heart out rudolph valentino) to the sudden hey-we're-out-of-film conclusion, you...will...not...stop...laughing. to sum the film up, its a poor man's warriors down under, complete--and that description alone should be enough, but then comes the wonders of "the spaghetti eating scene", "the 'we've got their tickets; they won't be leaving town now' scene", "it's the asians! run!!" and more. the only truly objectionable part is a gratuitously filmed rape. outside of this, i dare you to watch this film. and i dare you to find evidence of acting, or lines, or direction, or any of those other boring and superfluous elements that so-called critics say a film needs to be judged as good. if this movie doesn't cause fits of uncontrollable laughter before it ends, all i can do is roll my eyes menacingly from side to side at you and shout, "you dog! you dog! you dog!"

first off let me say, if you haven't enjoyed a van damme movie since bloodsport, you probably will not like this movie. most of these movies may not have the best plots or best actors but i enjoy these kinds of movies for what they are. this movie is much better than any of the movies the other action guys (segal and dolph) have thought about putting out the past few years. van damme is good in the movie, the movie is only worth watching to van damme fans. it is not as good as wake of death (which i highly recommend to anyone of likes van damme) or in hell but, in my opinion it's worth watching. it has the same type of feel to it as nowhere to run. good fun stuff!

star rating: ***** saturday night **** friday night *** friday morning ** sunday night * monday morning former new orleans homicide cop jack robideaux (jean claude van damme) is re-assigned to columbus, a small but violent town in mexico to help the police there with their efforts to stop a major heroin smuggling operation into their town. the culprits turn out to be ex-military, lead by former commander benjamin meyers (stephen lord, otherwise known as jase from east enders) who is using a special method he learned in afghanistan to fight off his opponents. but jack has a more personal reason for taking him down, that draws the two men into an explosive final showdown where only one will walk away alive.after until death, van damme appeared to be on a high, showing he could make the best straight to video films in the action market. while that was a far more drama oriented film, with the shepherd he has returned to the high-kicking, no brainer action that first made him famous and has sadly produced his worst film since derailed. it's nowhere near as bad as that film, but what i said still stands.a dull, predictable film, with very little in the way of any exciting action. what little there is mainly consists of some limp fight scenes, trying to look cool and trendy with some cheap slo-mo/sped up effects added to them that sadly instead make them look more desperate. being a mexican set film, director isaac florentine has tried to give the film a robert rodriguez/desperado sort of feel, but this only adds to the desperation.vd gives a particularly uninspired performance and given he's never been a robert de niro sort of actor, that can't be good. as the villain, lord shouldn't expect to leave the beeb anytime soon. he gets little dialogue at the beginning as he struggles to muster an american accent but gets mysteriously better towards the end. all the supporting cast are equally bland, and do nothing to raise the films spirits at all.this is one shepherd that's strayed right from the flock. *

wild rebels is fun in a bad way, but also frustrating due to the actual good, or at least workable, elements in the story. it deals with a race car driver (steve alaimo) who gets mixed up in a group of bikers called satan's angels, who hang around a lot until they decide to rob a bank. meanwhile alaimo also gets recruited by the cops to report back to them what the angels are up to and where they'll rob next. it's not even that the film is really too 'dated', though it does of course carry the significantly crude and stupid music in the film (from the band on stage in one scene, to alaimo "performing" if you could call that drek that, to the regular generic score). it's just that there's not more care taken by the filmmaker into putting a little more logic, direction, and better actors for the parts. as it is i didn't have a major disliking towards the film, as i did with the hellcats, but it almost left me a little indifferent to it all, too. what could come through as being unpredictable only comes through with stupid things like the name of the florida town ('citrusville' ho-ho). so it's not completely un-worthy then of its mystery science theater 3000 status as of late. the commentary is good on the movie, even if once or twice i almost wanted to hear what the characters on screen were saying in case it might have some worth. wild rebels might be more of a good time if you've got a six-pack and low expectations, but as it is i wouldn't watch it again.

legendary pop star steve alaimo ("don't let the sun catch you crying") stars as an unlikable stock car racer whose career has hit the skids (ha ha) because he constantly crashes his car (or as he laments, "i'm tired of being run down by every grease monkey that gets behind the wheel"). he falls into a bad crowd of humorously inept nazi bikers, improbably named jeeter, banjo, fats, and, er, linda. fats is the most likable of the bunch; he took a surfboard to the back of the skull and now only communicates through grunts, sort of a harley davidson leatherface.anyway, steve is fooled by the cops into catching the dastardly crooks in the middle of one of their bank robberies. the gang only robs banks for "kicks, man". i guess they give the money to charity. steve fails constantly, the bikers get greasier, and the whole thing never comes off as daring because it's so dull. this movie looks like it was filmed through a grease-soaked paper towel. not since "necromantic" has a movie so trampled my soul.the guy who played fats went on to direct "deranged", the ed gein biopic starring robert blossom.anyway, in summary: wild rebels: hilarious on mst3k, dreadful everywhere else.

oh dear! oh dear! oh dear!to think that films such as this were made, and probably enjoyed by thousands at drive-ins really boggles the mind. how innocent we were in those days.to put it bluntly, this film is crap. the hero is so wet you can hear his squishy damp footsteps in every scene. my lord, but he's just one of a whole slew of awful, awful actors that appear in this turkey. no wonder mst3k picked it. the story, such as it is, centres around a stock car driver (who is so incompetent, you really believe it is the actor driving the car) that he gives up and "gets in with the wrong crowd" oooooh! scary stuff. however, the wrong crowd turn out to be the biker equivalent of the three stooges and their "hand-me round" slut of a biker chick. as an example of how lame this whole thing is, the writers obviously wracked their brains to come up with a frightening name for the biker gang - if four people can be called a gang, that is. the result? the gang is called satan's angels! i kid you not.such dire acting and dialogue, along with ridiculous scenes, make for a wonderful beer and chips movie. but otherwise its just the worst kind of rubbish.as i said. once, this may have been considered good. but today it just makes you laugh (and cringe) with every minute that goes by. avoid it except for a good laugh. and make sure you're more than half-drunk too!

i completely forgot that i'd seen this within a couple of days, which is pretty revealing in itself. the umpteenth version of gaston 'phantom of the opera' leroux's locked-door country-house mystery, i had heard that it was an engaging and witty update. so it appeared from the likable title sequence and a few neat touches in the opening scene, but the film very quickly ground to a halt and became vaguely tedious and wholly unsatisfying.as a mystery the major problem is that it is fundamentally unsolvable by the audience: like the worst agatha christies, it depends on a character appearing in the final act with a wealth of background information that we have not been privy to. as a film, be it comedy or thriller, the crucial problem is that characterisation is almost non-existent. with the exception of the killer, everyone is a face-value version of the typical suspects in the typical country-house murder story - reporter, endangered heiress, suspicious fiancé, scatterbrained scientist father (a surprisingly poor michel lonsdale), etc. there's no depth and little of interest, and the frequently over-ripe or misjudged performances don't help. you frankly don't care about anyone in it, so there's no jeopardy or suspense. only claude rich and, in the last reel, pierre arditi get anything to work with, and only in the last reel does the film get close to a sense of resonance that is too fleeting to be really effective.for the rest, we get endless exposition and a couple of ineffective would-be comic set pieces (a promising one with a photographer trapped inside a grandfather clock is just too poorly thought through to pay off), with dennis podalydes reduced to irving the explainer for the last third of the picture. i'm not fond of country-house movies or agatha christie style whodunits, so those who are might cit it a lot more slack, but i found it a poor show. as rich says when the mystery is revealed, "it's all rather something of a disappointment."

a few buddies and myself have the strange hobby of seeking out really horrendous and utterly obscure (for a good reason) horror flicks and then subsequently watching them under the influence of mind-broadening consumer goods like alcohol and/or soft drugs. surely a lot of people do this, but they watch movies like the "godzilla" remake, whereas we torment our eyes and brains with stuff like "the loch ness horror". and, eureka, this is a prototypic bad movie! we open traditionally, with bag pipes music during the opening credits. this is, of course, to emphasize extra to us dumb viewers that the story is supposed to take place in the scottish highlights and not in director larry buchanan's birthplace texas. for that exact same reason, the cast members are seemingly also instructed to overact tremendously and talk with talk with atrocious accents. the american marine biologist prof. george sanderson arrives in loch ness with some brand new and highly sophisticated sonar equipment to track down the whereabouts of the legendary monster in the lake. meanwhile, there are many other parties hanging around the lake, like a group of kids on a science camp (what a boring way to spend your vacation), retired army generals looking for a luftwaffe plane that crashed in the lake during wwii and a bunch of thieves and failed scientists that are steeling the monster's egg. you would think that these numerous sub plots bring some diversity and excitement in the plot, but unfortunately that's not the case. "loch ness horror" is an overall boring flick with only a couple of noteworthy elements. the monster itself, for example, is a delightfully cheesy creation with cute eyes and a smoky breath. his teeth also glow in the dark, which is quite useful when you're dumb enough to go out on a boat ride in the middle of the night. near the end of the film, the remaining cast members were more interested in the lost luftwaffe plane than in the monster, so it was about time to wrap it up. "loch ness horror" is carefully recommended in case you're a fan of bad b-movies from the 80's, but be advised that it contains an overload of senseless dialogs and a bizarrely rushed ending that makes it look as if the film suddenly ran out of budget.

what can i say about a movie as bad as this? the people who made this movie, didn't even try to make the monster in it look realistic. you never see more than its head, and the head is just a giant puppet that has little movement except for when it opens it mouth to roar. and the sound they used for the roaring is the best part. at many points in the movie it sounds exactly like a tie fighter flying over! i couldn't believe that when i first heard it and had to rewind several times to make it sink in. other than the terrible looking monster and the noises it makes, there isn't much more to this film except for a few corny attack scenes and the crazy scotsman attacking the kids trying to have an intimate moment in his castle. still, it's watchable if you like this sort of trash. i know i do....

i think this is one of those few movies that i want to rate it as low as possible just to pay it a compliment.i haven't seen this movie in about 25 years, so i really can't say that much about it. it still seems to be very hard to find on video. but i remember my brother and i stumbled upon it somewhere in the toxic brew of late night uhf channel television of the mid 1980s when i was about 10 years old. so i've never actually seen the beginning of the movie, but i saw most of it. the first thing i remember is this couple is sneaking out of a campsite and they're rowing to an island to make out, and then they get attacked by an insane scotsman in a kilt with an axe! they manage to escape from him but get attacked by the loch ness monster, which in this movie is just a head and a neck with no body. the eyes and the mouth of the monster don't even move, it looks like a piñata.i mean i had just literally never seen anything on this magnitude before and it totally blew my mind. i had seen some bad movies on tv in the early 80s but i had never seen something so totally inept and so casually and thoughtlessly constructed that it seemed like the people who made it spent less time and effort on it than we did watching it. i had already seen some of the troma films and that type of thing that tries to deliberately be "campy", but this was the pure and real stuff and it was my first encounter with truly great bad film-making. this movie was like the last gasp of the drive-in era and i caught a whiff of it just in time. actually when we were watching it, we couldn't figure out if it was made in the 50s or the 70s. turns out it came out just a few years before i saw it.later i came into contact with mystery science theater and found out about a lot of the old b movies and serials, but i had already seen it in this movie. the movie is so funny that i had never even laughed that hard at the monty python crew or bill murray or any comedian. after seeing this movie i was always trying to search for the "good bad" movies and i got a lot of my friends into it. but this movie was and basically is an impossible one to find. i never really found out what it even was or who larry buchanan was until the 1990s when imdb took off and the internet took off and information started getting passed around. but this movie still needs to be discovered by a lot of others who might appreciate its transcendentally bad qualities. look for it.

omg, another bad film by larry buchanan. that guy did not learn to stop, did he? first, he gives us zero budget sci-fi movies and lies about famous dead people, and now he is exploiting the loch ness monster as being vicious.the "plot" is basically about some southerners of the usa pretending to be scottish camping out at loch ness. alas, out on the fishing hole, oops, i mean lake of loch ness, there is a killer inflatable monster that clams itself to be nessie, going out of its way to kill people for no apparent reason.i am surprised that the crew of mst3k never heard of this movie. yes, it is that bad too.

something strange is happening in loch ness. the water is crystal clear, nor cold. a giant robotic plastic monster emerges and kills scots! what is this movie?! first, i love reading stories about nessie, sea monsters in general. when i saw this for sale, i thought it was a cheap rip off of jaws. no. it was terrible! the story was pointless, acting was 100% garbage, the only up side was the cool mechanical nessie they used. it was full of inaccuracy, wrong locations, and bad everything. not worth your while, just leave it on the shelf (or garbage can) you found it on. on second note, this film was shot in cailifornia, not loch ness, a major diss to nessie fans.

**possible spoilers ahead**whenever fans of bad movies congregate for more than a few minutes, a name that invariably comes up is that of larry buchanan. this amazing director has given us remakes of other turkeys (zontar the thing from venus), cheap-jack crime dramas like a bullet for pretty boy, and tawdry conspiracy flicks like down on us and goodbye norma jean. the loch ness horror is a humdinger to say the least. overlooking the fact that loch ness is extremely long and narrow, larry filmed this howler on a wide and round california lake. early on, the film boasts some dazzling (for the budget) underwater photography and creates some atmosphere in spite of itself. then it degenerates into windy dialogue uttered by no-name actors with lapsing scottish accents, not to mention a soundtrack that will do nothing for the much-maligned bagpipe. at one point, campers sing "you take the high road, i'll take the low road," just to throw in one more scottish cliche. if scottish people ever decide to jump on the political correctness bandwagon they'll sue larry buchanan over this film, his surname notwithstanding. the monster looks like a giant papier-mache puppet and it makes the dragon in beanie & cecil look terrifying by comparison. in one unforgettable scene nessie takes to land and, to evade some patrolling soldiers, the fifty-foot long critter tries to hide behind a tree-and the soldiers don't see it! the loch ness horror is a true mind-boggler that must be seen-several times--to be believed.

pick a stereotype, any stereotype (whether racial, sexual, cultural, etc.), and i bet you'll find it in wassup rockers. do you think that all hispanic teenage boys are stupid, hairy, inarticulate, and dirty troublemakers? are hispanic girls sex-crazed, easy, ass-baring sluts? do black people all want to start fights and carry guns? do all gay people throw themed parties with pink drinks and ask young boys to model for them? are all white teenage girls rich, stuck-up princesses who are bored with white teenage boys and are looking for something a little more dangerous? if you answered "yes" to any of the previous questions, you, my friend, are a bigot, and you will love wassup rockers.director larry clark likes to shock his audiences (i was 15 years old the first time i saw kids and i think that's why i'm still a virgin), but wassup rockers isn't shocking it's just bad. he tries to be edgy and realistic with his minimal dialog and body-hair close-ups, but these characters and this story are completely unrealistic.simply put, wassup rockers is a teenage boy's fantasy. what 14-year-old boy doesn't want to be a skater who gets in trouble, crashes parties, drinks 40s, and is told by the hot, rich, white girl that his uncircumcised penis "looks dangerous?" besides that demographic, i really don't know who's going to enjoy this film.

this is possibly the worst film i have ever seen. what a weak waste of michael imperioli's obvious talent. disgusting film from start to finish. all i can say is, this director is no 'auteur'. you never once get inside the game, the character's head, the amazing talent with numbers the real stuey had. the coke scene is bad enough to throw your shoe at the set, it might have been a great scene had it been shot for movies and not the stage, with the camera half way across the house hovering over a mirror with drugs on it while the drama is going on far in the background. the scene where he wins the big championship is just laugh out loud ridiculous. this should be screened in film-making 101 - what not to do in making pictures.

its a totally average film with a few semi-alright action sequences that make the plot seem a little better and remind the viewer of the classic van dam films. parts of the plot don't make sense and seem to be added in to use up time. the end plot is that of a very basic type that doesn't leave the viewer guessing and any twists are obvious from the beginning. the end scene with the flask backs don't make sense as they are added in and seem to have little relevance to the history of van dam's character. not really worth watching again, bit disappointed in the end production, even though it is apparent it was shot on a low budget certain shots and sections in the film are of poor directed quality

worth the entertainment value of a rental, especially if you like action movies. this one features the usual car chases, fights with the great van damme kick style, shooting battles with the 40 shell load shotgun, and even terrorist style bombs. all of this is entertaining and competently handled but there is nothing that really blows you away if you've seen your share before.the plot is made interesting by the inclusion of a rabbit, which is clever but hardly profound. many of the characters are heavily stereotyped -- the angry veterans, the terrified illegal aliens, the crooked cops, the indifferent feds, the bitchy tough lady station head, the crooked politician, the fat federale who looks like he was typecast as the mexican in a hollywood movie from the 1940s. all passably acted but again nothing special.i thought the main villains were pretty well done and fairly well acted. by the end of the movie you certainly knew who the good guys were and weren't. there was an emotional lift as the really bad ones got their just deserts. very simplistic, but then you weren't expecting hamlet, right? the only thing i found really annoying was the constant cuts to vds daughter during the last fight scene.not bad. not good. passable 4.

i love sci-fi and am willing to put up with a lot. sci-fi movies/tv are usually underfunded, under-appreciated and misunderstood. i tried to like this, i really did, but it is to good tv sci-fi as babylon 5 is to star trek (the original). silly prosthetics, cheap cardboard sets, stilted dialogues, cg that doesn't match the background, and painfully one-dimensional characters cannot be overcome with a 'sci-fi' setting. (i'm sure there are those of you out there who think babylon 5 is good sci-fi tv. it's not. it's clichéd and uninspiring.) while us viewers might like emotion and character development, sci-fi is a genre that does not take itself seriously (cf. star trek). it may treat important issues, yet not as a serious philosophy. it's really difficult to care about the characters here as they are not simply foolish, just missing a spark of life. their actions and reactions are wooden and predictable, often painful to watch. the makers of earth know it's rubbish as they have to always say "gene roddenberry's earth..." otherwise people would not continue watching. roddenberry's ashes must be turning in their orbit as this dull, cheap, poorly edited (watching it without advert breaks really brings this home) trudging trabant of a show lumbers into space. spoiler. so, kill off a main character. and then bring him back as another actor. jeeez! dallas all over again.

the opening of "the jungle" promises us a safari adventure with a science fiction element, but mostly what we get is a travelogue with lots of stock footage and padding (and the odd leopard attack). the movie is leisurely when you want it to be gripping, and tries to inject interest into the proceedings with badly staged matches between various wild animals (i had no idea that lions and wild boars were natural enemies in the wild, did you? i thought the big cats stuck to hunting herbivores, but apparently the producers knew better). as for the actors: cesar does his usual great job of rocking the mustache, and marie windsor is reasonably believable as the progressively thinking rajah's daughter (nice eyebrows, btw!). however, rod cameron is barely watchable as the hunter returning as the sole survivor of his expedition. i'm sure he was in demand in his day, but here he comes off as a rent-a-center bogart : rough looking, but with none of bogey's range or timing. he spends the movie going back and forth from stoic anger to angry stoicism, and any time the screenplay attempts to crank up some romantic sparks between himself and windsor, you just have to laugh. that crabbed, knobby face isn't a good vehicle for tenderness. the screenplay is not entirely without merit, although it does make some odd choices. early in the first act, the screenplay makes a point of spending several moments where the heroes decide to bring along the obligatory clever young boy and monkey mascot, but then basically ignore them until ***spoiler*** the monkey somehow gets hold of a live hand grenade during the mammoth scene and accidentally tosses near windsor. this is so cameron can prove his bravery by diving on it and saving her life at the cost of his own.***end spoiler. it's possible that the indian version of this movie (which i understand ran better than 2 1/2 hours), might have given the kid and the monkey more to do. another thing that makes the film show its age **spoiler**is the issue of the woolly mammoths (the plot device that sets the safari into motion in the first place). when they finally appear, the way the scene is filmed, it's obvious that the "mammoths" (obviously elephants draped in shag carpeting) aren't really "attacking" anyone, or even moving all that fast, and yet cameron immediately sets to trying to wipe them out with hand grenades. these days, the idea of destroying the last known specimens of a species thought to be extinct would be unthinkable, especially when all they seem to do is roll through the jungle at a nice walking pace.***end of spoiler***so imo, four stars, which is pretty good for a robert lippert production (normally lippert hack jobs rate two or three stars at best). it's not a train wreck of a film, or anything; plus, it seems to mean well,with the rajah's daughter arguing for amelioration of the most repressive aspect of the "traditional ways" and the elements of "mixed race" romance that was pretty progressive in 1952. and there's some nice scenery and exotic spectacle. see it if someone offers to show it to you for free, but don't expect much except an interesting historical chapter of early fantasy cinema.

i had to watch this movie with my 5-year-old. he didn't laugh once during the entire movie...and he loves dogs and will laugh at nearly anything! this movie was horrible from all aspects: poor script (even accounting for a children's g-rated movie), poor production (the jittery camera shots made me feel nauseous for the first ten minutes), poor acting (perhaps they were "directed" to act cartoonish), and even poor sound quality (there are parts where the audio level seems fine, then you can't hear what the next actor is saying). i'm willing to put up with quite a lot when it comes to watching a child's movie, but this was worse than having a stick in my eye. i also didn't like being battered over the head with the god-heaven-belief thing. in all, it was the biggest waste of 90 minutes in my life...and i've done some serious time-wasting in my day!

what a waste of precious time! my 5-year-old daughter brought this home from my mother's house, and we watched it as a family. none of us liked it. this wretched little film, rife with glaring inconsistencies, overt christian themes and horrible film quality, is not worth watching even on a dare. it felt a bit like a bad high-school drama class attempt at film making. how sad to see talented actors (chris atkins, gary busey, and company) flounder their way through this trite and insipid storyline. the only good thing i can say about this movie is that the dog is cute. the film can should have gone straight to the pound. avoid this film - your time is better spent watching paint dry.

this movie comes down like a square peg in a square hole. a poorly made peg. a peg so cheap it couldn't even be produced in a sweatshop assembly line in chinatown, mexico. in fact, when you try to press the peg into the hole for which it is obviously designed, it crumbles into sticky, disgusting pieces that smell like rotting fruit and won't wash off. quigly is such a peg.this movie is so mind-bendingly awful, it couldn't have even been created. a movie like this must have been the result of some accident of nature; some freakish entity that congealed in the corner of a dank office somewhere and festered and grew until it was too big and terrifying to look at. only science would be interested in such a thing; anyone not bent on studying it would exhume it from this world.what it comes down to is this: if you're the kind to enjoy first year violin recitals, racism, or coke zero, it might just be your birthday.

i cant explain what a load of rubbish this film is. like really i cant. its just that bad.plot=crap acting=crap budget=so low its laughablejesus, its like the only good thing in this movie is the fact the main character was fairly hot.the only people i feel, that think this movie is good are the ones who took part in the film. i'm sure they are not the ones who funded it because there was no money put into this. (hahahaha to the bit where there heads get shaved)this movie has already wasted too much of my life so i am not going to waste anymore time writing my review for it.

from watching the trailer, the movie looked pretty interesting. the production of the movie is also pretty good--it looks like they had a good budget and doesn't look like a cheaply made movie. the acting ranges from good (joe morton as professor simon) to ok (kelly overton as eve) to bad (james haven as don).the actual content and plot of the movie is weak. the movie starts out like it could become interesting and ends with a poorly executed, disappointingly boring, twist. watching the first 10 minutes and last 5 minutes of the movie would have made this movie ok but everything in between makes this an absolutely boring movie to watch. it's as though they made a short movie then tried to force it to be over an hour long by stuffing the middle with an hour of filler material.if you want to waste a good hour and half of your life, watch this movie. otherwise, stay away from this extremely boring movie.

the digital effects were done on the cheap and the action sequences lack suspense. this was essentially made for tv and it shows. david suchet looks bored and nigel planer looks down right embarrassed! and as for robert carlyle's dick van dyke london accent, no comment! if you want to pass away an hour or two when you've nothing on then it will do. if your going to buy the dvd wait a few weeks and pick it up in the bargain bin at asda, cos thats where its heading! if the budget was bigger and richard doyle's book followed more closely, then it could have been something special, but as it stands its a bit poor. watch the trailer instead! or read the book and see what could have been.

this movie follows in the tracks of the riddle for an all star british cast in a downright awful movie! poor cgi effects, poor editing, poor direction, a cast that i hope were well paid as this will be a nail in many a careers coffin.nigel planer should've donned his neil wig once more & gone out with a laugh at least!it was like a particularly long & drawn out episode of "torchwood" but without the camp fake canadian doctor fella...it had the same overly dramatic music though, perpetually repeated, in a vain attempt to drum up some tension.oh the humanity!

well as the headline suggests this is not the particularly good movie i was hoping it would be. i thought it would be great with mr fully monty man himself but tragically not. from the beginning i literally lost interest immediately when 2 women are just making tea and then suddenly she points out there is random water coming from under the door, then bam a full on flood through the route of the house its hard to believe they didn't notice the rising water level outside or at least heard it. sorry for this to sound like a rant but it really grinds my gears and has affected me. most acting was poor and the story tried to copy nearly every cliché to each disaster movie ever but just failed in that sense. cgi was poor i could do a better job using ms paint, directing poor too, and at the end i didn't care about 1 character at all!!! don't waste your time people no wonder it was released straight to dvd. well thanks for reading xxx

i usually like these dumb/no brain activity movies, but this was just too stupid. there were way too many clichés and the plot didn't really make much sense. there were a lot of loose ends and the ending was extremely poor and abrupt. we didn't even get too see if the big master plan worked. we only got too see the main character sob over his dead farther, the professor (that died because of stupidity (see below)).one scene annoyed me particularly. why did the professor only have about 5 minutes of oxygen in his container when he went to manually override the dam? and if they only had oxygen containers containing 5 minutes worth of oxygen, why didn't he bring two or three of them? then he would have survived that was bloody stupid. the movie is pretty full of such stupid things. i can not recommend it at all.

i don't normally write reviews, but for this film i had to. i'm shocked at the acting talent in this move going to waste... the script was appalling... the editing awful... and the plot very thin. you spend the first half of the movie wondering who is talking to who and what on earth they are doing. the latter half of the movie slows down slightly, but has no depth or feeling. the only saving grace is the nice, but still limited cgi, and the location being london. i gave 3 stars for that, and the fact the actors still tried to do a good job with the drivel they were given. if you fancy losing a couple of hours of your life with mediocre popcorn disaster movie entertainment, by all means, this is the movie for you. but i would recommend doing something else with your time instead, like watching the real archive footage online! :) http://www.weatherpaparazzi.com/flooding.asp

miscast, badly directed and atrociously written, this is watchable if you have an hour or two to kill or are suffering from insomnia, but only just. robert carlyle fully realises his potential as an actor of supreme mediocrity with only one expression to his repertoire (that of a chronically constipated football hooligan nursing a crippling inferiority complex), which he manages at times to alter slightly by flaring his nostrils and baring a row of skewed yellow teeth (this to indicate anger, tenderness, grief, surprise, horror, hilarity, compassion, etc.) in his role as "the best marine engineer in the uk" and son of a university professor he is about as convincing as my neighbour's cat. tom courtenay, equally miscast, slurring and mistiming every line, appears permanently soused to the eyeballs, and would seem no more able to tell a flood from a puddle of his own urine if he were standing in it. all in all, another silly attempt on the part of the british to imitate hollywood pulp at its most rubbishy. the dialogue is a series of badly-delivered clichés; the action is disjointed; the plot is pointless and amputated; and the characters, if you can call them that, do not even make it into the basic two-dimensional sphere of their american counterparts.

breaking dawn starts in a californian college as professor simon (associate producer joe morton) tells his students that they have to perform an intensive six week study of a mental patient in cape state hospital as a crucial part of their education, fail & they will never become qualified doctors. a bright, young, attractive & intelligent student named eve (kelly overton) is given a particularly difficult patient to study. his name is don wake (james haven) & is a convicted killer, he was found covered in blood besides the dead body of a woman (diane verona) & her young daughter (jenette mccurdy). at first don won't even look at eve much less talk to her, but like the trooper she is eve persists in trying to figure him out. eventually don begins to talk but what he says frightens eve, he says that someone is watching her & mentions the name malachay. eve then begins to see a dark shadowy figure at her every turn, as don churns out the conspiracy theories & bizarre statements eve slowly begins to lose her mind as the line between fantasy & reality becomes more & more blurred. is there something more to the supposed nonsense that don talks other than being the insane ravings of a psychiatric patient...?written & directed by mark edwin robinson i have nothing but negative feelings towards breaking dawn. now, we all like a good twist ending, the sort of ending which catches us unawares, surprises us, works well with the rest of the film & stays in our memory like the cool twist endings to the sixth sense (1999) & fight club (1999) to name just two good examples & to a lesser extent the endings to films such as scream (1996) where the identity of the killer comes a nice surprise & isn't that obvious. then, of course, there are films whose endings spoil everything that has gone before & as an example lets take, oh i don't know lets say breaking dawn because i have never seen such an awful ending to a film, never. breaking dawn starts out as a decent psychological horror thriller with spooky things starting to happen to eve, it's not the most action packed film ever by any stretch of the imagination but it holds ones interest, it's not the most absorbing film ever either but it is more than watchable & it's not that bad a film until the twist ending, i have to keep mentioning it because everything else up to that point (which was ok to be fair to it) suddenly becomes irrelevant. i am sure there are people out there who think they have this muddled mess of an ending figured out down to the last detail, all i can say is that no one will be able to explain this thing in a satisfactory way to me & as far as i'm concerned it doesn't make a bit of sense & never will. breaking dawn is crap & it's a waste of time watching it to be rewarded with the lamest ending in film history, it's as simple & straight forward as that.director robinson doesn't half make a mess of what could have been a decent thriller, maybe he thought what he had shot would play out ok or maybe it was ruined in the editing room but i'd imagine it was more likely down to a rubbish script as he tries to tie all the absurdities together within the space of a few muddled minutes & give us all a happier than happy final shot. he builds the tension quite well during the first 80 odd minutes but it's all for nought at the end of the day.technically breaking dawn is fine & it is generally well made throughout. the acting is pretty good, overton is nice & easy on the eyes & puts in a decent performance. was it just me or did the guy who played don look like john morghen star of such italian sleaze classics as cannibal apocalypse (1980), city of the living dead (1980), the house on the edge of the park (1980), cannibal ferox (1981), stagefright (1987) & the church (1989)? ok, maybe it was just me...breaking dawn is rubbish, i hated it all because of the final few minutes. don't get me wrong it wasn't exactly getting me excited up to that point but it was ok. definitely one to avoid as far as i'm concerned although it seems to have it's fair share of positive comments on the imdb...

i really do not joke when i can honestly submit that this film is not suitable for sunday night viewing on itv4.the underground scenes are just awful when london is supposedly under 30ft of water, robert carlyles character is drab. the police commissioners outfit reminds me of something kate moss threw up and nigel planer looks very very old, in fact, i am worried that he may have had suffered a stroke whilst filming.the father of robert carlyle who was 'right all along' has obviously been necking too many ketamin and whilst he has a major part in this awkward journey, he deserved to be killed off way way before he was caught pretending to be kate winslett (titanic) whilst dangling over the thames barrier.i'm sorry film lovers but avoid at all costs.

topical? certainly. entertainment? probably - but only on removal of any shred of the viewer's common sense. reality? only in so much that it was made on this planet.how thousands of people were supposed to have died as a result of a 5-metre wall of water in a city liberally littered with buildings in excess of 25 metres high is quite beyond me. carlyle's line to the effect of "how could anyone survive that?" when the shot shows forests of buildings with several floors above the water is completely laughable. further, if someone commits themselves to an area (under water) where one cylinder of air is not enough (i.e. they are going to die), why not use the simple expedient of taking more than one cylinder? clearly, the writer thinks that people in stressful situations cannot count beyond one (one cylinder, one floor).rather than watching this tripe, you would be more informed and entertained by throwing the dvd away and reading the pricing information on the cellophane outer wrapper.pitiful, truly pitiful, and a terrible waste of the on-screen talent.as for the sexist propaganda suggesting that only women can see through the problems to illuminate the solutions to be effected by the expendable men: yet more pc 'tosh'. small wonder that first blood, delta force, navy seals and other such movies of little or no merit will always have a following while this blatantly politically-motivated bilge is peddled.

this awful effort just goes to show what happens when you not only use computers to generate the effects, but also let them devise the plot and write the script. someone somewhere has obviously come up with a new bit of software that asks a few questions then churns out four hours of loosely connected clichés, lousy dialogue and a collection of stock characters that you end up wishing had all drowned in the first five minutes.tom courtney took the prize for worst performance. saying that he was wooden would be an insult to trees. it's hard to fault robert carlyle in almost anything he does, but the odds were stacked against even him in this one, especially since he was for some unaccountable reason required to adopt a gor' blimey london accent.a complete washout.

'flood' is a prime example of how throwing good actors and cgi at a film will do little to compensate for a rubbish script. the basic premise is fine: what if a freak storm threatened to send the sea straight over the thames flood barriers and engulf london so fast that most of the inhabitants would probably never get out in time? it's basically the new york segment of 'the day after tomorrow', but that shouldn't make it any less of a film. however, the script just isn't there. it's merely functional, flat, and lacking in depth. great british talents like robert carlysle and david suchet to name but two do their level best with what they've got, but their characters are two-dimensional cyphers, like something out of an old marvel comic. and it'd be frankly easier to turn back the tide. not that every actor gets let off the hook - tom courtenay seemed capable of only one emotion throughout the film, but then he wasn't given much of a challenge.i applaud any opportunity to see some non-hollywood disaster flicks for a change, and i don't expect zillions of dollars spent on rendering ultra- realistic graphics. however there's no excuse for shonky writing - especially from a country that has produced some of the best science- fiction ever made on next to no budget at all. this is the kind of half- hearted b-grade fluff the sci-fi channel produces, and that's hardly a target to aim for. if like me you are such a fan of disaster films you're still tempted, do yourself a favour and watch it with some friends. better still; don't bother.

you would have thought, given how much this overblown pile of rubbish must have cost, that the budget could have stretched to a decent scriptwriter. instead, they seemed to have opted for a bog standard hollywood 'paint by numbers' disaster movie plot and dialog. the only cliché they seem to have missed was the cute kid. but every other one is there. there's the sullen hero, flung together by fate with both his ex wife and estranged father. there's the doting dad and the rebellious teenager.there's the 'professor that everyone thought was wrong until it turned out he wasn't'(played appallingly by the normally excellent tom courtney seemingly in the grip of some powerful drugs), plus the comic duo wandering about in the deserted underground railway.i sat down to watch this full of anticipation. the cast is, as noted, amazing. yet within minutes it became clear how bad this was going to be. stuff this useless should come with a warning. something along the lines of;'this film may have been made in britain but was aimed at the american market. it therefore contains tired clichés, stock characters, stilted dialogue and a plot so lame brained and simplistic that even george w bush could understand it.'avoid.

the production values for this film make it fall short of hollywood blockbuster status, and the script makes it fall short of cult status. what is left is a tired formulaic attempt at the disaster movie genre that will disappear with the ebb tide.a decent cast, are either miss cast, or cannot be bothered.the beautiful joanne whalley is unable to bring any gravitas to the role of police commissioner nash who wears the most irritating matching waist clincher above her skirt.jessalyn gilseg plays the heavyweight part of director of the thames barrier with all the conviction of a fairground candy floss. her canadian nationality and accent were presumably drafted in to appeal to a transatlantic audience. it, and she, fails.her initial appearance in a tight fitting pink jogging suit as she arrives at work is risible.the part of the "siren old git who was right" is played by tom courtenay as though he is acting in his sleep, and the various plot twists that are designed to energise his son, played by robert carlyle, struggle to get any response from him.nigel planer looks determined to commit ritual hari kari for his failings as met office director, or for his acting, or both, and only david suchet emerges with some credit for his role as deputy pm.there was enough in the story, and the cast and the effects to have produced a decent effort. alas that did not happen.

on the face of it this film looked like it might be really good - it isn't.the cast is pretty good, but most of them seemed embarrassed by the whole thing. the real disaster in this film is not the flood, but the script. it attempts to include every cliché in the book, all done incredibly poorly. the ending is very abrupt, but this is a blessing in disguise. congragulations if you make it that far.all three main male actors (carlyle, courtney and suchet) would surely agree that this is the low point in their careers. i hope they got paid a lot of cash, because none of their reputations come out in tact.the special effects are quite good, but the same thing was done to much better effect in the day after tomorrow.in short, a pointless exercise. don't waste your time.

let me first start out by saying 1 out of 10 is too good for this movie. it's unfortunate that imdb doesn't have tenths of a star... i watched this abortion of a movie in the middle of the night due to insomnia, and it was absolute garbage. the plot was horrible. the acting was horrible. the movie was utterly boring. "malachi" looked like the shadow with alec baldwin (the shadow is infinitely better than this as well) the character eve was so undeveloped and 2 dimensional she didn't even grab my attention. i didn't even know her name was eve. don was interesting when he kept his mouth shut. the "twist" (if you can call it that) was laughable and pathetic. when it came, the movie had done such a horrid job of building suspense or attachment to any character that i simply thought "who gives a s***." the only thing that made me even lift an eyebrow about this movie was the fact the med. teacher was dyson in terminator 2 (also a movie that was light years ahead of this motion picture massacre.) anyone who was involved in this movie should be ashamed of themselves for wasting 90 minutes of countless people's time. it's no wonder no actor from this movie ever had a fruitful career. in summary.... this movie is so bad, i feel dirty and need a shower. worst movie in history, gigli was better, prom night (the remake) was better and dare i say it saw iv was better...........

these days, writers, directors and producers are relying more and more on the "surprise" ending. the old art of bringing a movie to closure, taking all of the information we have learned through out the movie and bringing it to a nice complete ending, has been lost. now what we have is a movie that, no matter how complex, detailed, or frivolous, can be wrapped up in 5 minutes. it was all in his/her head. that explanation is the director's safety net. if all else fails, or if the writing wasn't that good, or if we ran out of money to complete the movie, we can always say "it was all in his/her head" and end the movie that way. the audience will buy it because, well, none of us are psychologists, and none of us are suffering from schizophrenia (not that we know about) so we take the story and believe it. after all, the mind is a powerful thing. some movies have pulled it off. but those movies are the reason why we are getting more and more of these crap endings. every director/writer now thinks they can pull it off because, well, fight club did it and it made a lot of money. so we get movies like the machinist, secret window, identity, and this movie (just to name a few).

françois traffaut's "mississippi siren" had an unconvincing plot. the screenplay required too much elasticity in suspension of disbelief. the plot went at a glacial pace. it started off in an interesting setting but soon drifted onto the shoals of melodrama that lacked logic or intelligence. what were the critics thinking? this one is overrated even to be described as a loser. even catherine deneuvue, who charmed in "the umbrellas of cherbourg" and "belle doe jour," managed to be simply annoying. we rented this movie at the same time as we rented another traffaut film. we watched this one first, and found it to be so bad that we sent the other one back unseen at the same time.

this is one of the more poorly made movies i've ever seen. one has to take anything by truffaut seriously; it's not just some b-movie cranked out by hacks.evidently truffaut couldn't decide whether he was making a noir or a sentimental chick flick. and neither could deneuve, whose dozen (?) character flip-flops are simply unbelievable -- not even badly acted; just not acted at all. among other things, how a woman as beautiful as deneuve could be a person such as julie/marion is simply beyond anyone's ability to suspend disbelief; the role absolutely demands someone not so beautiful. belmondo's acting also suffers although imho his character is not quite as unbelievable as deneuve's. the cliché ending (which i won't describe) is unfortunately all too appropriate for this complete mistake.

i'm bout it(1997)developed & published by no limit films>>pros: absolutely none>>cons: i don't even know where to begin!plot summary: master p plays a drug dealer that looks, talks, and acts more like a live-action cartoon character. that's all the plot i got out of this movie.review: i remember back when i was in the ninth grade during its release and everyone in my class praised this clown called master p. this movie is so bad, it's not even funny. all the characters in this film are extremely tired stereotypes, the audio is only audible when music plays, and the movie looks like it was videotaped off a public access channel. luckily, i didn't buy this film like all my other inner-city degenerate classmates.my rating:1 out of 10my verdict: avoid this video like its a sexually-transmitted disease.

i usually enjoy watching laurel and hardy, but this is obviously one of the films they made while they were on their way to becoming a successful comedy team.the plot is all too simple, and is mainly based on one joke; how strange kilts and scotsmen are. and that's all. okay, there are some other jokes, but i didn't find them very funny at all; they are outdated and (i guess) were not very entertaining when the movie was first released.still, the movie has got two of the most charming faces in history, and they make the best out of the awkward story (which i expect was filmed without a proper script) and the scenery is nice to look at. in my opinion, watching this is only worthwhile for laurel and hardy fans, other people should stay away from it.

what a truly moronic movie, all i can say is the writer must be very fond of magic mushrooms and lsd because this must be the result of one of his 'trips'.you follow the whole movie thinking alright this is very weird but hey i'm sure at the end there will be a perfectly good explanation for all of this... only to be disappointed to find erm no there's no explanation at all and the twist at the end makes it even more confusing. at the end of the movie you'll probably have the same facial expression as if you were standing in a que paying for you groceries and the merchant told you, that'll be 11.95 please and proceeded to elbow you in the balls for no apparent reason. there are so many factors in this movie that go unexplained and i think it leaves it to the imagination of the viewer in an entirely bizarre way. don't get me wrong i like weird movies, 'the cell' could easily be described as weird and twisted but in my eyes it's a brilliant movie (despite casting j-lo who i dislike to the maximum even that didn't manage to sway my opinion). this isn't one of those movies, and i think you should take in to consideration the characters of those who praise this movie. i can tell you they are probably the sort of people that would go to an art exhibition, see a splat of pigeon excrement on a white board and say "oooooh what a masterpiece, the artist has truly found a unique way to portray eternity" when in actual fact all it is, is bird excrement on a board.keep that last bit in mind when watching this movie, thanks for reading!

i received this movie in a pack called "50 all-star movies" for $18 (45 cents each). many are good. this one was terrible. it was a hackneyed retread done 1000 times before and each time better. a crippled ex-jock is dared to coach a team made up of juvenile delinquents. they learn from him that they can make it if they play by the rules. i'm sure the kids and the locals were thrilled to be included in a "real tv movie", but i can't imagine what the folks that launched and produced this project figured they could bring to this already over beaten subject. i kept waiting to see that 'new twist' or 'new angle' but, honest, it doesn't come. avoid this movie. forget about the 45 cents, i want the 96 minutes of my life back.

like another reviewer, my wife bought this movie as part of a 20 movie family pack. i guess you could say that this was a decent made-for-tv movie for 1980, but it is super-predictable and the acting, except for robert conrad, is generally sub-par. the football scenes are nothing special and seem to mainly act as filler for the movie. the movie is very dated now, but a decent remake could probably make this into a good movie. however, is that really necessary? i mean, how many "underdog sports team works together for the big game with the undefeated guys" movies do we really need? this is probably a good movie for your younger kids if you find it in the bargain bin, but a sports movie buff will find it lacking.

i don't know if this type of movie was as cliché then as it seems to be now.considering how many "bad news bears" films had already been released by 1980, however, i think that this sort of movie was already a tired idea.a former football player is partially paralyzed in vietnam and is confined to a wheelchair. the chicago bears offer him a pr job but he wants to coach. at the same time, his underage nephew is picked up for armed robbery. we are told that he has already been arrested over a dozen times before and he must now serve some hard time...which turns out to be less than a year! of course, the kid is actually a good kid who only needs a tough male role model in his life. the same goes for all of the kids in the detention facility. yes...even the one locked up for attempted murder! i'm sure you already know what happens so i'll try and keep the rest of this brief.our protagonist becomes the coach of the kids' football team. he overcomes the delinquents' cynicism and earns their respect. his team faces off against a local high school team (yeah right!) and they get their butts kicked. now determined more than ever to prove himself a worthy coach, he demands a rematch. will these underprivileged, scrappy kids with hearts of gold be able to improve enough to win the rematch? awful execution of the football sequences ruins any possibility of excitement in this film. "coach of the year" should get penalized for roughing my brain. 1/10

when this movie was made in 1980, i was a teenager in the football stands playing as part of the audience. this was done at mooseheart, illinois. the big letters spelling out "mooseheart" at the top of the stands were covered up with a banner in the movie. the director would tell us to cheer loudly at certain points, as if a touchdown was being made. st. charles juvenile correction center is a real place less than 30 miles from mooseheart, although i think it may have closed down recently. during one scene, they show a black woman and a white man in the audience watching the game. right below them, you can see my sister noel's head (she was 11 at the time). in the vhs version, i can only see the top of her head, but when i saw it on tv in 1981 i could see her whole head and my sister jacqui as well.i thought the movie itself was ok for a made for tv movie. since there's already a description of the movie here, i need not repeat it. it's worth seeing at least once.

a child-like puppeteer, for a public access children's show, goes over the deep end when he discovers kids he entertains at a hospital were victims of horrible abuse. this movie has some of the worst indescribably monstrous parents you could ever come across. not an exploitation film as much as an afterschool special on the dangers of child abuse. seemingly harmless, mr. rabby takes matters into his own hands when it seems the police are neutered by lack of evidence to convict loathsome parents of their terrible abuse towards their children. the children are emotionless and zombie-like(..due to the amount of abuse inflicted upon them), the parents loud, inconceivably harsh, contemptible, and belligerent. the mothers, in particular, are so obscene, you'll root for their execution. they are essentially miserable people taking out their frustrations on the kids. our detectives are a tired lot, frustrated with the whole judicial process, how police procedure is often unable to prosecute those who beat their kids into submission. while the crimes themselves are heinous, the film doesn't explicitly elaborate the grisly activity on screen. i'd say the reason to see this is for tom basham's performance as the unbalanced man-child who slips into psychosis. there's quite a weird dinner table sequence between basham's mr. rabbey and his guardian shortly after he murdered the parents responsible for the death of their child, regarding how he lives in a fantasy and how what he had just done has left an indelible mark(..notice the changes in behavior, pretty impressive work, going from innocent to creepy). peter renaday is lt. hayes, the detective in charge of the homicides cases, expressing on his face the strain that is taking it's toll on him. there's an early performance by john ashton as detective matthews, always raising the ire of hayes because of his inability to follow directions, not to mention how opinionated he is regarding the parents abusing their kids. awkward laid-back bluesy score that seems improper for a film such as this. controversial conclusion establishing that even kids can only tolerate so much. a bit too slow moving for my tastes, but there's an effective use, i felt, of basham's eyes before he takes care of business, waiting patiently as he prepares to strike.

this movie over does it on the cgi i mean sci-fi really they over did it the original '' bats'' is better it does not use cgi like the sequel. in this movie its the simple people running from mutated killer bats. and really bats in afghanistan?! the plot involves u.s army soldiers finding a terrorist and being attack by bats and dying<_< but the reason i gave this movie 3 stars is because the way the camera zooms in on the soldiers. the acting is bad and this doesn't even look like a horror movie. in all this movie is a fairly good tv movie for sci-fi channel. but if like sci-fi's movies you'll like this movie because you just like channel 43 oh and if you fall asleep during the movie don't be surprised. oh sorry i think i give it 2 stars instead.

okay, i can sit through almost any movie, and i tend to get a real kick out of sci fi originals, but there was a major flaw in this movie that made me have to turn it off half an hour into it.having served in the us army, there are certain expectations in a movie including the military. at least some semblance of attention to proper military rank, uniform, and terminology is necessary if you expect a viewer to actually enjoy the experience. "bats: human harvest" had characters wearing rank that was facing the wrong direction on the lapel and, later in the movie, the time was listed as 11:00 hours, but it was full dark outside. even if the script was perfectly done, and the dialogue spectacular, and the acting oscar-worthy, if the people making the movie don't care enough about the movie to even bother to look up the proper way to display military time, why should anybody bother to attempt to watch it?

i have yet to watch the first entry in this series, however, fortunately, i was still able to follow the complex and intricate plot, with all its unexpected twists and turns, and i applaud them for the utter originality of the concepts herein. in case there is any confusion, let me leave no doubt as to the fact that everything i've just said is coated in pure, carefully nurtured sarcasm, the kind that flourishes and grows exponentially when exposed to crap like this flick. a clear sign that this is unimpressive is that it was directed by a visual effects creator, whose only other credit in that field is a henry rooker film that wasn't well received. the acting is average at best, and i defy anyone to not find... scottish computer-woman(come on, seriously, what is with that last name?)'s russian accent laughable and/or irritating. there is an attempt or two at stylization in this, and they are reasonable. the action isn't terrible. cinematography and editing are fine. the music is cool enough. language is infrequent, if even that. violence is fairly bloody. i recommend this solely to fans of b-movies, and i will say that you can do worse than this. 1/10

an elite american military team which of course happens to include two good looking women and a guy who can't quite grasp teamwork, lots of bats, some terrorists, and a spetznaz team that acts like the gang that can't shoot straight -- all thrown together in a jumbled plot with mediocre acting. this one has nothing much going for it. the characters are not compelling. even the setting, which has great possibilities, looks like something out of the middle of rural pennsylvania, not an exotic boreal forest in eastern europe.the bats are certainly ferocious looking. they can even pick up a man and fly with him for a few feet (harpies?) or chop off an arm. you see delta force surrounded by hundreds of bats with a guys shooting assault rifles and pistols at them and bat flopping to the ground. it would be like trying to shoot skeet with a rifle from a distance of 3 feet. utterly clueless. the dialogue is rancidly unrealistic, with boy/girl jokes and flirts in the middle of tense parts of the mission. one of the team is blown up by a mine and the first one on the scene just stares sadly at his body, stunned, not even bothering to take cover or secure the area. in fact after the rest of the group shows up he talks about how the area is laid out like a minefield -- thanks for the heads up bub.if you want a contrast in how a horror movie involving a small military group can be done well on a low budget check out outpost. harvest is not the movie you want to see. in fact i think i'm going to give it a two instead of a three if i can make it through the second half. seems unlikely at this point.

dull one-note characters with next to no development, unimpressive performances by people who sound like they're simply reading lines, and ludicrous special effects combine to make this a genuine stinker. the story begins with eminently bland commando russo and his fellow soldiers attacking an al-qaeda training base. the scene tells us that al-qaeda has recently come to seek an ultimate weapon, and also serves to illustrate russo's only character trait, a tendency to eschew teamwork. with the help of a collection of blank slates and walking stereotypes, including a russian spy, russo travels to chechnyan territory to catch a mad scientist working for the terrorists. along the way, they encounter vast hordes of flesh-eating bats that fly in broad daylight for some reason. from there, the movie becomes nothing more than a dragging morass of ridiculous action, including a scene in which a swarm of bats slices a soldier's arm off!

i give the show a six because of the fact that the show was in fact a platform for damon wayans as the cosby show was for bill cosby, it dealt with a lot of issues with humor and i felt that it in fact tailored to getting a laugh as opposed to letting the jokes come from the character. michael kyle an interesting patriarch and a wisecracking person. he is phenomenal in movies, but in the show he was there for the wisecrack and though i loved it, i felt that the laugh was more important than plausibility.jay kyle i have loved her since house party and have enjoyed her in school daze and martin, this was a great role for her and she made a great choice in picking this sitcom to co-star in. i also feel that jay and michael were more like equals in the show but jay was more the woman who fed her crazy husbands the lines and went along with his way of unorthodox discipline because she may have felt that it workedjr just plain stupid, his character should have been well developed and even though he does have his moments of greatness, we are returned to the stupidity as if he learned nothing, which drives me nuts!!!!!!!! not to mention that most of the situations (in episodes i've seen) seems to center around himclair the attractive sister who dated a christian, i found her boyfriend's character to be more interesting than she was (she'd be better off sticking to movies, the writers should have done more to show her intelligence but it's not stereotypical enough)kady lovable and the youngest daughter. i think the writers established her character most on the show aside from the parents and franklinfranklin i love this character and i think they derived it from smart guy (t.j. mowry) which only lasted one season. they did a great job of casting for this little genius (the effort would have been made if jr would have been the smart one but show the down sides also)all in all, this sitcom is a wonderful thing and it's homage to the cosby show is well done, i love the show and wished it would have stayed on longer than that. i can't wait to see the series finale

this relatively obscure hong kong "minorpiece" is the perfect desert island movie for video age peeping toms (at least its first half is). every set-up, every scene, every sequence is an excuse to look up a girl's skirt, stare down at her breasts, gaze at her bottom and leer at her tight crotch. what it's establishing is the lead character's perverted proclivities, of course(!)genre stalwart anthony wong is a marginally perverted married man who is plagued by erotic daydreams and outrageous fantasies. all involve scantily clad, sexy chinese ladies with nothing but sexual servitude on their minds.the plot is thickened by a homicidal subplot, voodoo doll skewering and a little rape and pillage.some of the sex scenes are fairly hot and the gore is liberal, but the supernatural elements introduced into the second half feel half-baked and the plot developments are ludicrous.clearly, producer of garish garbage wong jing was in a terrible hurry to get this into and out of theaters.the arty title sequence did not fool this jaded punter.

doll master is an example of a lousy horror film, fallen somewhere in the space with it's two not so well established genres, a horror film and an emotional drama film. seems like the doll master tries very hard to be a very scary horror film, but it fails. the noise of the dolls while moving is like taken from the croak of kayako in ju-on, and the crawls are like sadako esquire. the killing dolls will remember you a cute version of "chucky". but compared to child's play, this film is more superb. but the story seems a nothing, the brilliant camera shots and the brilliance of acting was taken away cause of the plot.don' watch this if you are expecting great shocks.

have to disagree with people saying that this is a lousy horror film with good acting and camera-work - i'd say it's an okay horror flick ruined by shockingly abysmal acting and poor camera-work - watch 'ju-on : the grudge instead of wasting your time with this garbage. the principal idea behind the film is rather an original one, considering the abundance of killer-doll-based scare-fests which have been foist upon us over the years; unfortunately, the story is handled with all the subtlety of the latest michael bay actioner, with a cast of characters which are uniformly unlikable and played with precision-perfect dreadfulness by actors presumably sifted from daytime korean soap operas. it isn't scary and only succeeds in dampening your expectations of the next korean horror movie to come-a-calling. oh well.

i remember when i first heard about jack frost. i was in video ezy at miranda with my family on a monthly video hiring tradition. it was at this time that i worked up the courage to venture over towards the horror section of the store. browsing the various titles, i finally came across jack frost. the cover was enough to convince me that the film was beyond my viewing pleasures. years later the film disappeared, only to be replaced with the inevitable yet unnecessary sequel. i once again ventured to the horror section and picked up the case only to come to one conclusion: the film would be scary but not intentionally.jack frost 2: revenge of the killer mutant snowman (quite a title) follows off where it's predecessor left it. sheriff sam is seeking counseling after his ordeals and jack is now in the form of anti-freeze. to escape his past, sam and his wife head to an island hotel where he is in the company of a wide variety of slasher film stereotypes including busty female models, thick headed sports jocks and caribbean staff. however, jack is released from his liquid grave and is back to his icy methods. he heads over to the island and proceeds to kill anyone that would prove to have an awesome death. only sam can stop him.let me just say that this is a straight-to-video film so it's bound to be bad. but this is terrible even in the eyes of other over the top films. the camera work is poor, using a camera that would make a soap opera look majestic. half the actors look like they've come out of a porn shoot and the other half look like they've come out of a retirement home, but in actual fact they've actually come out of an asylum. there is an extensive use of special effects used in the film which tends to alternate between bland puppetry and cgi that can be bettered by an infant, and the death scenes are mostly off screen showing us little of what has happened to the hapless, yet deserving, victims. but the film is most memorable for it's killer one liners such as "there's something that needs a little christmas stuffing" and "i know pronounce you officially f***ing dead!" ultimately the whole purpose behind a film like this is to make a popcorn flick for those friday nights of boredom and even it fails at that. to make a sequel to a film that was a poor slasher with a concept that a child would find unbelievable must've taken some nerves of steel or a total frontal lobotomy. to director michael cooney thanks for wasting my time. to everyone else avoid like arsenic.

jack frost 2. the worst "horror film" i have ever seen. why? 1)the premise is well beyond ridiculous 2) the damn thing doesn't even have legs to move on! 3) it escapes after being completely submerged in anti-freeze (first film) 4) get this...it travels all the way across an ocean of salt water to a tropical island to get revenge on the sheriff that did him in the first film. 5) "killer snowballs". i have yet to be drunk enough to see "ginger dead man" so as of the writing of this, jack frost 2 hold the distinction of being the stupidest "horror" film ever. even surpassing the inaneness of it's predecessor (if you can believe that!).

jack frost 2 is out of the question, i'm actually surprised people are allowed to make these sort of movies.as sam and his wife take to the tropicana for a relaxing christmas, jack returns to kill off the fun and take on a revenge with inbreeding...don't take a swip at this film at all, most people say its a laugh with your mates, but frankily its a waste of time. if the people who made this film can get a job by doing what they do, they can at least take the time and effort to write up a better story, especially the cheesy character names.

this is the worst film i have ever seen, bar none. from the flimsy-looking, poorly lit sets, to the laughable acting, to the infantile plot and shoddy, drawn-out action sequences, this film is so bad, its hilarious. for about ten minutes. after which you will be reaching for the remote or the power socket to end this film non-experience. although it was obviously made with the entire production and acting staff's collective tongue rammed in cheek (please god), i found jack frost 2 so dreadful as to be unwatchable for more than a quarter of an hour. if you have not had enough of it after this time, you must be indulging in drug abuse.

why did i have to go out and buy (yes buy!) jack frost 2: revenge of the mutant killer snowman??? maybe it was a burst of temporary mental derangement? but i'm guessing it's because i kind of enjoyed the first jack frost. it was a silly but funny horror-comedy which had some okay effects by screaming mad george. that and the fact that on the back-cover of the sequel there was this nice picture of this guy impaled by this giant icicle (coming out of his mouth with a lot of blood and all). so i thought: if it's as idiotic as the first and has some nice splatter/gore in it, it should be fun, right? well, i was so dead wrong! let me first say that the movie deserves some credit for having an immensely insane and retarded plot. i mean, a mutant killer snowman on a tropical island that spawns mutant killer baby snowballs which can only be killed or harmed by bananas??? as much as i love the premise, i really hated the movie. first of all: while the first jack frost looked like an actual movie (seemingly being shot on real film and all), this sequel has the look and feel of a third-rate soap-opera. it has this way too slick shot-on-video look. the lighting is just plain awful (bright white spots for the day look, and stupid colors like blue and green at night). the acting... well don't even go there. the dialogues range from stiff to extremely senile (that jamaican man was just moronic, saying "man" after every sentence). and when it comes to the voice of the killer snowman, all i could think of was a seventh-rate chucky from child's play spewing dumb and supposedly witty one-liners before he kills someone.the best joke was were one guy asks "why are you talking to your watch?". and the best scene was undoubtedly the one with that beautiful asian chick popping up out of nowhere and taking a swim in the pool totally naked (thank god for that!). oh, yeah, and that little scene over the end-credits with those two japanese dudes on a miniature ship being badly dubbed had me laughing too. but the worst thing about this movie was: where was the gore and splatter action everyone is talking about? there were plenty of occasions to show some decent gory killings. a lot of people were killed off in original ways here, but all off-screen. like i've read in many other comments, there were indeed nice set-ups to a head explosion, a crushed body, eyes being poked out, tongue ripped out,... but on the crucial moments the editor cuts away to some blood splatters on the floor or nothing at all. that frontal shot of that british guy being impaled (from the back-cover of the dvd) wasn't even in the movie. i only saw that particular killing filmed from the back (meaning i didn't see sh!t!). i was waiting throughout the whole movie for that to happen, and then i get to see nothing?!?! what a let-down! could it be that i saw a cut version of the movie? that would be a shame, 'cause only a decent amount of splatter-fun could have saved this movie if you ask me. seeing a lot of killer snowballs reduced to bloody pulp just didn't cut it for me. speaking of those snowballs: they were done very poorly. they made munchies look like state-of-the-art 'animatronics'. but i guess that was the whole point of it. at some point, the special effects crew even turned to some laughably bad cgi. boy, you really have to see it to believe it. best is to not see it, actually, 'cause this flick is just too bad (okay, i did laugh with it, for it kept getting worse and worse). just stick with the first jack frost (1996) and you'll be okay (just bare in mind that it's a pretty silly horror-comedy but fun in it's own right).it's funny, but writer/director michael cooney somehow must have realized that he was a pretty bad director after jack frost 2, and then focused on writing. turns out he then wrote two pretty good thriller screenplays for the i inside (starring ryan phillippe) and identity (starring john cusack). so the man seems to have some talent after all.now it would be far too easy to give jack frost 2 the lowest rating possible. so i say one point for that naked asian babe doing the skinny dipping and one point for those completely retarded snowball babies. way to go mr. cooney!

horrible movie. this movie beat out revenge of the living zombies for the worst movie i have ever suffered through. what the !@$% were the morons who made this film thinking. was it supposed to be scary. because man let me tall you it wasn't. it was so dumb it wasn't funny. we all know that tropical islands are the natural hunting grounds for killer snowmen. and those stupid baby snowballs. stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid. fake snow and lousy actors. oh and frost looks nothing like he does on the box. do not waste your time. rent it and destroy it.

please, if you're thinking about renting this movie, don't. if you're thinking of watching a couple of downloaded clips, don't. if i had my way, nobody would even have to read this summary.the acting, despite being one fo the high points of the movie was still pathetic. the director was probaly a sadist. the witty one liners were something you'd expect from a room of highly paid anti-social 7 year olds that eat paint-chips for breakfast.the problem with this movie, is that it tries to be a movie like "evil dead 2"(do not under any circumstances associate these 2 movies) in that it's so bad it's funny. but it also tries to be funny at the same time, and fails so overwhelmingly to do so, that your sense of humor is left too crippled to do anything but set off your gag reflex in an attmept to save itself.i could go on for much much more, detailing just how awful it really was, but i think it would strip me of my will to live just to continue to think about it. if you need me, i'll be off trying to boil myself so that i might feel clean again...

if you like bad movies (and you must to watch this one) here's a good one. not quite as funny as the first, but much lower quality. a must-see for fans of jack frost as well as anyone up for a good laugh at the writing.

in all, it took me three attempts to get through this movie. although not total trash, i've found a number of things to be more useful to dedicate my time to, such as taking off my fingernails with sandpaper.the actors involved have to feel about the same as people who star in herpes medication commercials do; people won't really pay to see either, the notoriety you earn won't be the best for you personally, but at least the commercials get air time.the first one was bad, but this gave the word bad a whole new definition, but it does have one good feature: if your kids bug you about letting them watch r-rated movies before you want them to, tie them down and pop this little gem in. watch the whining stop and the tears begin. ;)

alright, we start in the office of a shrink, and apparently not a very good one. the main hero from the first jack frost is in the shrinks office blurting out random rhymes about jack frost. gee, alright my brother is yelling ''turn it off!''. anyway, back to the crappy movie.the shrink has his speaker phone on and is letting his secretary and her friends listen in on this heroic insane sheriff. i suppose he is supposed to be the hero from the first movie, but he looks nothing like him!. yadda yadda yadda, they laugh at the poor sheriff, yadda yadda. now some people are digging up the anti-frozed snowman, yadda yadda, now we're in a lab with some type of doctor people.. i don't quite see how this has to do anything, but their poking the anti-freeze/evil killer mutant snowman with needles, heating it, shocking it, adding strange and bizarre chemicals to it, the whole nine yards. nothing. alright, they give up and leave it in a fish tank. one of the doctors leaves his coffee on the top of the tank. the janitor walks in, cleans stuff, bumps the fishtank and the coffee spills the tank which makes jack alive.behold the power of mocha! now somehow he is in..uh.. i believe the bahamas... but it looked more like hawaii.. but it couldn't be hawaii! unless they spent all of their budget on the dang air plane tickets. bah.. i wont spoil the rest of this rotten movie, so you'll have to rent it and watch it your self... er... i wouldn't suggest doing so though.... sheesh..

jack frost 2 was a horrible, terrible, sadly pathetic excuse for a sequal to a great movie. the original, was a low budget comedy horror film about a murdered who was turned into a snowman after an accident with some toxic waste. and the snowman went around murdering people, and avoiding blow dryers like the plague. this, however, was a far cry from the quality of the original. it seems like this even had a lower-budget because for some reason, after an hour into this film, i still hadn't seen the snowman. some revenge he's getting if he's always in the form of ice cubes with a cheesy voice-over and a little shake of the cooler he rests in to give animation to the character. disappointing to no belief, even for a fan of bad cinema.

-may contain spoilers-clearly, who ever made this film must have had a lot of connections. i just can't see it any other way. what really surprises me is no one used the name allen smithee, and more surprising, everyone involved didn't use this name.anyhow, where to begin. the bad dialogue, the crummy costumes, the sorry looking film stock, the unintentional comedy, the over-the-top characters, and more inconsistencies than george w. bush's college career. i don't know what was funnier, the guy losing his arm because of a snowball, or the slow motion scene where all the baby jack frosts' were getting killed. also, one of the great lines of all time was uttered in this film. "how do we know it's him?" like there's another mutant snowman who can talk and kill people with snowballs! a great camp film, but a very bad film overall.

this movie sucks. did anyone notice that the entire movie was shot in like 2 rooms. there are never any outside shots and if there are its obviously film taken from somewhere else. this movie blows hard, painful to sit through too. stay far away.

yes, in this movie you are treated to multiple little snowmen on the attack in apparently a very warm climate so yes this movie is definitely not to be taken seriously. it is in fact a much worse movie than the original as at least with that one the whole production looked like it cost more than a couple of bucks and a video camera to make. it has its funny moments, but really playing off the cheapness of your movie and making that be your intended laughs is kind of weak film making if you ask me. you can not come up with a good story, your effects are going to really be bad, hey let us just make the movie look as bad as possible with horrible one liners and we have our movie. the first one at least had a somewhat credible story as the snowman in that one attacked during the winter and not what amounts to a resort. it also had better effects too, this one is just a step or two ahead of "hobgoblins" as far as the monsters are concerned and you really want to be more than a step a two above a bunch of hand puppets. still, it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost. actually, i am just kidding, but really it was the funniest part of the movie.

ill-conceived sequel(..the absurd idea of having the killer snowman on the rampage at an island resort where there is no snow or cold weather)brings back the spirit of the psychopath, returning thanks to a scientific experiment providing foreign elements which reintroduce life to his molecules(..it's the best i could do to explain this preposterous concept).i could go into depth about how he winds up at the island in order to slay numerous tourists, but i simply find no reason to bother because it'd all be so exhausting. anyway, the filmmakers think it wise to kill off the pretty girls not ten minutes after their arrival(..i mean seriously, why worry with even introducing them to us if we can't enjoy our eye candy no longer that this?!).the "snow anvil" murder scene takes the cake. ice icicles protrude from the beach's sand so that a victim can fall on them. oh, and another girl is stabbed with a pair of weenie tongs.look i get what's coming to me when i sit down to watch a killer snowman movie..such a ridiculous supernatural slasher will either tickle your funnybone("oh, it's such a wonderfully cheesy horror movie!")or have you pondering why the hell you're wasting time with such nonsense. jack frost has the power to freeze water(..then how were they able to melt him in the first film?)and causes the island resort to snow. one sequence has jack freezing pool water, encasing a swimming model under the sheet, result being her drowning with nowhere to escape.oh, there's also a recreation of the "tongue stuck to the icy pole" bit from the christmas story("cowatonga dude!").i gotta hand it to the cast, though..they're real troopers for trying to make this wretched material entertaining. christopher allport(..perhaps unwisely)returns as sam, to face his old nemesis, as does eileen seeley, as his wife. the attempts at tongue-in-cheek humor(..for me, at least) fell flat, but the cast soldiers onward trying to make the most of a very difficult situation, with spirited performances they do their best to rise above the pitiful premise and woeful dialogue.a development occurs which increases the danger towards those still around to face off with jack, his genetically altered water molecules, thanks to the introduced foreign elements, allow him to withstand coolant/anti-freeze, and, even worse, he now can reproduce..through indigestion, jack hacks up what appear to be snowballs which hatch to reveal little snowballs with black eyes, mouth and sharp teeth! the killer snowman costume and little snowball puppets introduced later in the film might produce belly-laughs if you are in the mood for such shenanigans, but i personally found this junk rather hokey(..that's the purpose behind it, i suppose, cheap guffaws from those willing to embrace this)and unbearable.the snowball offspring is an obvious homage to gremlins where we get a bar scene where the little bastards are celebrating in number over terrorizing victims at the resort. the weapon against them..bananas! it's explained that when jack went to kill sam in the first film, both fell in a truck bed full of anti-freeze(..an icicle emerging from jack's belly was penetrating sam's chest when he pushed them out a window into the truck bed, and i guess in their being "being linked" by the icicle, jack inherited sam's banana allergy, or so this is what we are led to believe!)and in doing so both "merged" in a sense.phew, such a film as this defies simple explanation. it's a film with effects and plot so terrible, one might find the presentation enjoyable because of it's many failings.

having already seen the original "jack frost", i never thought that "jack frost 2" would be as absurd as it is. boy was i wrong! then again, a-pix movies have a way of showing unbelievably bad material, even worse than you might expect. i believe this is the first a-pix sequel, and it may be an indication of what to expect in the future: more a-pix sequels.it's hard to watch this without laughing, especially during the later parts of the movie in which jack frost's offspring (which are essentially snowballs with eyes, arms, a mouth and sharp teeth) start killing people with the typical comedic dialogue and silly voices to go with it. they are shown both as puppets (with a stick underneath to move them) and as computer animation, which i have to say looks very cheesy. the computer animation surprised me, as the first "jack frost" had no such effects.i'd strongly recommend that you see the original "jack frost" before seeing this one (both of which it would be preferable to watch with a group of friends) to get the full amusement out of it, and because it would make more sense ("sense" being a relative term).now only if there was "uncle sam 2"...

after kenneth opel's rousing story of the invigorated me back into the pleasure of reading during grade school, i had high hopes for this series. the story of an underdog bat voyaging across country to reunite with his colony captivated my imagination and resonated deeply with my burgeoning imagination.upon hearing of this series, i began browsing bardel animation's site and liked what i saw. the character design looked impressive and the fast-paced plot seemed to have been stretched respectably across a thirteen episode arc. much was my disappointment, then, when i decided to watch a rerun early one morn.the opening episode shows our hero, shade silverwing, pursuing a tiger moth in the deep hours of the night. chirruping an echolocatory song, we see a nifty if crude cgi effect illuminate the moth, and the chase takes on a frenetic turn as the tiny insect creates numerous illusory copies of itself do deceive its pursuer. as a lover of biology, i had a decent understanding of the principles in place (tiger moths can sense the sounds their predators use for echolocation and spin a sonic cover for themselves) but without such exposition i would have surely been lost. a minor quibble, i thought. surely they director will fill us in momentarily. i waited in vain.once our protagonist roosts down with some of his fellows, we are treated to some of the dullest dialog i've ever seen on television. chinook, shade's childhood rival, begin taunting the diminutive hero with the stupidest lines i've ever seen on a show. i can understand the writers not producing shakespeare, but one would think they'd have had some social contact in their lives - surely enough to make communication seem natural. oh, how wrong i was.the voice acting, while not horrendous, hardly was a shining example of human achievement. "oh shade, you're broken the law!" shade's mother sighs emptily. "you must come with me, young one." croaks frieda, the wizened elder of the silverwing colony. the actors try, but it hardly matters at this point, as the story becomes less and less compelling with each pass minute.while each episode deals with a problem of the week, as is typical of with most television series, overarching story arcs pervade the saga, for better and worse. while the main point of the story is shade's reunion with his family, later episodes tack on other story arcs, involving cannibalistic bats from the southern jungles and a brewing war between birds and beasts. the writers try to do too much at once, fighting to compress as many promising ideas as possible in the hopes that it will grab audience interest enough to keep the bloody show going on. unfortunately, these attempts are futile to all but the eight to ten year olds at whom this show is aimed.while it's nice to see canadian media be perpetuated, it would be all the sweeter if the enjoyability of the series wasn't limited to the immediate family of the animators or frothing fans of kenneth oppel's books. there are worse things out there your children could be watching than silverwing, but far better programs are out there, too. pass on the mediocrity and read the books instead.

there were so many reasons why this movie could have been great. i'll give you three.1. sienna guillory. she is extremely hot in this movie and was the reason i chose to watch it in the first place.2. tim curry. amazing bad guy and i always get excited seeing him in movies (even home alone 2).3. jason donovan. for all you aussies and poms out there, this is a rare treat. former neighbours star 80's heart-throb dressed in drag selling drugs.however none of these things nor the fact that the movie is about the drug/rave culture managed to make this movie even remotely interesting. the script was dull, the performances ordinary and despite the scenes with j.d and any scene with sienna i found everything about this movie pretty passe.3 out of 10.

a rather disappointing film. the club scenes were ok, but over done. the plot was thin and boring. it's only redeeming features were some of the characters. the chemist and the dj were pretty fun characters. tim curry's character was just bizarre and stupid.

a pretty transparent attempt to wring cash out of the thriving british club scene, sorted is a film that shows promise in certain departments, but does very little else. a perfunctory thriller plot (which is there merely to string the club sequences together), variable acting and a pretty ludicrous script, all stop sorted from being the showcase that director jovy obviously intended.however, although jovy is sometimes over indulgent (especially when using the often ill-fitting dance music) he does show potential, and the lack of an anti drugs message is enormously refreshing. overall however, the film is a wasted opportunity, and the prospects for a great clubbing movie remain out there somewhere. watchable nevertheless.

this cosy middle class sitcom became the subject of much hatred by the new breed of talented comedians in the 1980s, such as ben elton. did it deserve such malice? well terry and june was never clever, it was never a well-written tale with different threads which intersect at the conclusion. it was the show your mother and father and probably grandparents watched. they chuckled rather than laughed, but they were never likely to be offended by the show, so the fact that it never challenged them was immaterial.one foot in the grave suffered initially because it appeared at first sight to be just another terry and june.a few days after the death of terry scott an episode was broadcast on terrestrial tv, and that has been its final outing. there have been few repeats of the show on any tv channel.thankfully tv comedy has advanced since terry and june. it's hard to find kind words for it - terry scott did make the best of weak scripts.

this show lasted for most of the 1980s, and had its moments, but plots were usually dishwater thin and often painfully unfunny.terry scott and june whitfield were wasted in this sitcom, they both deserved better, but it does provide some fond memories and i have found myself smiling at some repeated scenes. june whitfield's talent for comedy is allowed to shine through on occasion (when she is not being a foil to terry) and she really is clever.the 1980s is the last decade where you will find this kind of middle class, middle aged comedy, and many people remember it fondly, but i prefer to remember the decade for alternative comedy and the biting satire of spitting image.

please don't waste your money on this sorry excuse for a motion picture. the only way i could see someone watching this is if they are a die-hard fan of erika elaniak, but you would be better off surfing the internet than to watch this piece of crap. i would rather watch paint dry than go through watching this. they lure you in with casper and erika and lead you to believe it is a sci-fi dracula movie, but it quickly works out to be a farce about van helsing's great-great (you get the point) grandson, here ironically for one last show-down between himself and dracula.the movie also tries to make a political statement, i believe, when it appears that none of the characters in the future know who god is, that they have not been taught about him and don't understand when they see a cross. could have done a lot more with this idea. it's a shame it turned out the way it did.

it is quite rare that a movie comes along that is so useless, that i with imdb allowed the use of negative scores. in fact, i reflect back upon this movie and i truly cannot think of a movie that had so little going for it. acting: your kidding right. direction: no. a plot: no. this movie has nothing going for it if you take it as a serious movie, this is often the case with movies of this genre, but most movies of this nature can be watch as if they are a comedy and you can laugh at how pathetic the characters and situations are and almost get your times worth. this movie is so empty, that it cannot even suit that purpose. i have to give this a -1/10, three points lower then any other movie i have ever rated. i truly feel that the staff involved in this movie should pay me for the 83 minutes i spent watching it. i do not really have the words to describe how bad this is. no one should ever watch this for any reason again.

i won't reiterate what so many others have said about this film; i'll try to add a few new points. the coolio-as-vampire bit is a nod to fans who are familiar with his turn on the blondie song "no exit" in which he assumes the role of a rapping vampire (it actually works as a musical concept and is in fact a great song). casper van dien is no worse than brad pitt and is actually more handsome. and really what does anyone go to a brad pitt movie for other than eye candy? same here, although this is poorly filmed (check out "starship troopers" instead). and of course udo kier, after having played dracula in the morrissey/warhol film, has little more than a cameo. enjoy it if you can.

this was by far the worst movie i have ever seen! me and my husband own over 600 dvds, most of which are sci-fi and horror b-movies that aren't top quality, but still entertaining. dracula 300 had absolutely no redeeming qualities at all! the writing was horrific, and the acting was even worse. it took us a 3 tries to get through the entire movie, because we could only tolerate it in 30 minute intervals. we thought surely it must get better...we were wrong. i would rather watch a corpse being embalmed than to have to sit through that again!!! when it ended me and my husband just looked at each other like "uh..is that it?" the ending seemed like there was supposed to be more, but they ran over their apparent $500.00 budget and were like "oh, crap...we are broke..end it now...quick..roll credits!"

hey if people thought ed wood was a bad director then they totally have not seen this movie. i mean there were gaping plot holes and under utilized cast. shoddy special effects. i mean i cant believe that this movie came out from a hollywood studio. a high school drama club could probably come out with a better product. i mean they had erika eleniak who is gorgeous casper van dien and under rated actor. their agents should be shot to ask them to sign on to this dribble don't they read scripts. i still cant believe that tiny lister was a survivor in the movie i was banging my head the whole time at why him and not a descendant of van helsing be the last man standing. i am a fan of vampire movies and this is by far the worst they should stake it so that it never sees the light of day.

wow, there's a lot of venom directed at this movie, and a lot of it is deserved, but it's not the worst movie of all time. (that's probably "zoolander".)anyway, if you're high on something, really drunk, or just in the mood for a "b-minus- minus" movie that you can make fun of, this may be your cup of tea.yes, as others said, the first part of the movie makes you think you're watching an updating of the bram stoker novel. two of the main characters are named van helsing and mina, the ship is the demeter, and they're in the carpathian galaxy. you later find that van helsing is a descendant of the original, and he just happens to be on a ship in the 30th century with dracula. suuuuuuuuuuure.oh yeah, and to add to the originality, this "spooky ghost ship" movie has another character named ash. sound familiar?there's paper-thin character development and anachronisms like the aforementioned manual wheelchair, and coolio and tom lister talking 20th century black slang. but what really makes the movie ridiculous is the ending. if that's what happens to the characters, then the previous two hours have been a waste.like i said, it you want a dumb movie to play "mystery science theater" with, and your mind is in approximately the same mode required for viewing the "great vegetable rebellion" episode of lost in space, then you may find this diverting. otherwise, put a stake in it, it's done.

well it is about 1,000 years in the future and we have finally breached traveling the vast distance between galaxies!! but sadly we still use guns that shoot bullets, black men are still calling each other brothers, and getting high, stoned, fighting etc.. common stereotypical urban black men are still getting the short end of the stick! babes in tight black rubber pants that look like they're from baywatch share close quarters with the captian and crew. crippled people still require wheelchairs to move, no fancy cures, implants, or robotic legs. dracula still looks and acts gay. need i go on... in short this move was shot on a typical sci-fi set low budget props, actors, and no real special effects to speak of. the beginning, the middle, and the ending was pathetic. i have to go off and shoot myself now there is nothing left to live for.

...an incomprehensible script (when it shouldn't have been) dependent on a rather flaky voice-over.the animation, however, show real talent.quite visually impressive.

there is a reason to call this a teen flick. out of 100 possible points i would put it somewhere in the teens. it is predictable, the acting is horrible, especially the minor roles, and above all else it is super predictable. the ending is so hokey that i should have left early and maybe it would have passed. by the way, could you call the male lead a pervert? i bet if it really happened, someone in my school district would have said so. finally, in the school i grew up in, even though the average class had over 1000 students, we could have picked out a chump like josie as being a fraud and we would have singled her out of the crowd. my final word is save your time, when it comes on tv watch something better, like the stock quotes.

i had nothing to do before going out one night so i didn't want to watch anything too heavy, i picked the perfect film. this must have been a gift to barrymore from someone she slept with, the director raja gosnell has made nothing but silly crap and the writing on this one is just atrocious. in what high school can you register without a parent present and no proof of age or former schooling? they let kids all come to the prom with no shirts, in skin tight leotards, ass shorts and one girl was dressed as eve wearing only fig leaves? she announces that she's 25 and her brother is 23 but there is no reprisal from the school, parents or lawsuits of any kind against the newspaper for fraud or spying? the newspaper boss wants to catch the teacher in an underage sex scandal but doesn't realize the teacher is coming on to a 25 year old so any case would be entrapment? they allow a camera in and record peoples private conversations with under age kids? i wonder if i hired my younger sister to go back to hs with a camera on her and filmed under age girls for my personnel use i would not get in some kind of trouble??? nahhhh no problem. didn't she have to take gym or go to the bathroom at some point? the secondary characters in this were like cardboard cutouts of what high school students are thought to be and everybody was a stereotype. jessica alba is just embarrassingly bad in this mugging for the camera at every chance. in what world do the parents not get suspicious when their uber-geeky daughter is miraculously asked out by the school stud to the prom? and they don't ask the guy inside to meet him like every other parent in history. if some guy in my school or any other school for that matter had conned my sister and thrown eggs at her in her prom dress he would have been in a body cast for the rest of his life. this movie is so contrived and predictable it's nauseating, and why at the end is everybody (the alpo girls included) cheering for this chick when two days before they hated her????dumb, dumb and dumb.

brilliant acting, excellent plot, wonderful special effects! this is what i would say about this movie if i had been watching it with a bag of diarreha on my head for the entire film. instead, i endured a 2 hour crap-o-rama. our "brilliant" story begins with some billionare who has nothing better to do than look in volcanoes in a vain attempt to find his lucky charms. instead, he finds a 5'4" man in a cheesy rubber dinosaur suit and some queer cave-folk.in his infinite wisdom, (along with his infinitely large nose)he decides to go inside this volcano with a team of "special" people. to travel to this underground land, they go by plane? no. boat? no. they use this giant soup can with a "solid metal" drill on the end that i swear i saw wobble. in summation, this movie was faker than....oh that's right! this was the fakest movie i've seen! for those of you who haven't seen it and are thinking of sitting down on a sunday afternoon with this wonderful movie; i warn you! if you watch this movie you should be prepared to cut of any shred of your manhood and give yourself a full frontal lobotomy.eccchhh!! the rating system only allows for a minimum of 1/10. i give this a -10/10!

kinda boring, kinda gross, kinda unsettling, this wasn't horrible, but not too good. there's a good creepy bit when the statue comes to life, though, props to this scene. not much happens, and the movie just feels sort of scummy. i was happy when it ended, and don't believe anything about this being a true story....very surprised this is averaging around 6.

an art student in rome is possessed...or something. she has dreams of being nailed to a cross and satan himself raping her. he possesses her (i think) and turns her into a sex addict. that's about all i could take and i turned it off.a pointless "exorcist" rip off. i caught this on cable back in the 80s and was horrified...and not in a good way! this movie is supposed to be a horror film but turns into nothing more than a sex film disguised as a horror movie. there's tons of pointless female nudity and the actress playing the lead has to degrade herself more than once. we see her being raped by satan (a hot-looking guy), masturbating, coming on to her own father...gotta give her points for bravery. add to that bad dubbing, editing (the rape scene looks like it was cut a bit), lousy acting and a story that makes next to no sense. the one disturbing sequence (her being nailed to the cross) almost works but the lousy "special" effects ruin it. this is one of the few horror film that was so bad i stopped watching. skip it.

wow! what a horrible, hideous waste of time this celluloid atrocity turned out to be. i remember seeing it years ago and thinking it was fun but now...it's just plain silly. not to mention the fact that it is a blatant rip-off of "the exorcist" to the point where it was re-released at one point under the title "the sex-orcist". the only real difference is that the producers have the gall to further discredit themselves by slapping on the claim that the events in the film are real! who in their right mind would actually believe such a bold faced lie? to make matters even worse, there was a video release in circulation with cover art that blatantly tried to cash in on the "rocky horror picture show" by throwing a pair of lips on the cover! how low could one possibly sink? do not be fooled by the false claims, blatant lies or title rip-off because you will be sorely disappointed if you do!

i just can't get it, freaks out on the planet are talking about this one as a must seen, they even dare to call it a (s)exploitation because the possessed girl is seducing priests and is masturbating all time. don't let me laugh. i watched the movie, seducing is only at the end of the movie and don't call it seducing,it's just bad language that's she is talking. and the masturbationscene is a big laugh too, she tries to seduce her father while masturbating, let me be clear, with her clothes on you perverts out there. it isn't gory or bloody at all, everybody is vomiting on beyond the door, well, let me tell, that one is for me better than this flick. only the last 5 minutes the possessed one is vomiting and having weird eyes. if i had know that this is so bad then i would never caught me a copy. if you really wan't to see a (s)exploiation about exorcism watch angel above, the devil below or other cheesy ones. a waist of time this is.

out of the handful of alternative titles in english, "the sexorcist" is definitely the most appropriate one, since this is basically just a shameless rip off of william friedkin's classic horror film in which they replaced 13-year-old linda blair with the 19-year-old stella carnacina only so that she could gratuitously show her ravishing naked body. i'm not sure what exactly satan tries to accomplish here, but he exclusively seems to possess the young girl to play sexual tricks on her! poor danila masturbates around the clock and tries to seduce priests and even her own father into having sex with her. the young girl is introduced as a smart and ambitious theology-student with an odd-looking boyfriend (driving a stupid yellow car) and loving, albeit adulterous parents. when she takes a peculiar crucifix home to renovate, the ancient relic comes to life and no less than satan himself (played by ivan rassimov of "jungle holocaust" and "planet of the vampires") starts to torment her. the overlong masturbation sessions and some bizarre nightmare sequences cover about three quarters of the movie, and then finally director mario garriazzo begins with the actual exorcism. that final segment is even more embarrassing and amateurish! the priests don't really do anything apart from saying some vague prayers but, somehow, danila seems cured all of a sudden. there isn't much gore, the dialogues are horrible and the producers seem to compensate every little flaw by adding more sleaze! this is one of the strangest italian exploitation efforts of the seventies (why the hell are they referring to "the rocky horror picture show"?), but definitely not one of the best. if you fancy clones of "the exorcist", i recommend "demon witch child", "beyond the door" and "the antichrist".

the film is somewhat entertaining, but the greatest feature is shalom harlow's laughable performance. it has been 4 years since this movie was released and hopefully harlow has gone through more training. perhaps she should stick to the more worldly, somewhat corruptive characters that she has generated in other performances.

as the film reviewer for a local gay magazine i automatically get sent any dreck if it happens to have a homo in it. chicken tikka masala is churning on in the background as i write this. i gave it my undivided attention for 53 minutes before i found myself involuntarily shouting - like a tourrette's sufferer -"this is the sh**test film i have ever seen". we're just coming to the emotional climax where the son is giving some coming out speech to his father at his wedding. father seems to be taking it quite well. an attempted honour killing at this point would at least have livened the film up a bit. and made it funnier. i didn't particularly like beautiful thing, for example, but could at least see why other people did. it was made with some professionalism and i seem to remember it had at least a couple of good lines. the lack of wit in this film is quite astounding - even the most mediocre sitcom will tend to have recognisable jokes. the nearest this movie got to being funny (at least in its first 53 mins) was the subtitled comment delivered to the fat unattractive female lead "look at her with her legs wide open - she's like the mersey tunnel." completely witless and i didn't crack a smile but i could imagine someone with a low iq (who perhaps works in a chip shop) enjoying it.i'd imagine it's some lottery-funded atrocity. if not i can at least console myself with the fact that the backers will lose a substantial amount of money as even a low-budget british film will still set someone back a couple of million. seriously, if i met the most handsome bloke in the world and, on going back to his place to make sweet love, i found a copy of this in his dvd collection ("man, i love this film") i'd probably kick him in the nuts and leave forthwith. and this from someone who's gone about six months without any of the aforementioned sweet love. oh lord i hate this film.

for those expecting the cover art and story outline to indicate another entertaining bollywood indian production, beware: no musical dance numbers or songs of production value exist to brighten the mood in this rather tired story of arranged marriages in the british indian culture - with a few variations thrown in. as written by roopesh parekh the script jumps around topics worthy of discussion only to cover them up with routine avoidance tactics. harmage singh kalirai directs like a traffic cop, trying to hold together the disparate subplots to the point of keystone cop tactics.jimi (chris bisson) is a medical school student who is gay and has a lover jack (peter ash) and they live with jack's obese, alcoholic, loose morals aunt vanessa (sally bankes) and sally's chubby daughter hannah (katy clayton). jimi's family is visited by the patel family from delhi who bring their beautiful daughter simran (jinder mahal) to england to find a husband. jimi's parents (saeed jaffrey and jamila massey) and his grandmother (zohra sehgal) decide simran is the girl for jimi to marry and arrange an engagement and wedding in the custom of indian ways - without consulting jimi. jimi discovers the plot and is too spineless not to go along with it, a decision which enrages jack and infuriates vanessa. hannah tells a 'little lie' to simran (that she is jimi's daughter) and the wedding is off. when jimi's parents visit jimi's house they discover the drunken vanessa, are repulsed by her, but eventually decide that for jimi's happiness they will go along with the fact that vanessa has given them a 'granddaughter' and decide to use the marriage preparations as a wedding for jimi and vanessa. jimi convinces the very reluctant vanessa to go along with the idea and before long vanessa is dressed in a sari, prepared for a wedding, and jimi, terrified at what he is doing just to please his parents, includes jack as his best man. at the wedding the truth comes out and to jimi's surprise his family adapts to jimi's true self and the day is saved by simply being truthful.the cast copes with this silly bit of nonsense rather well and there are some good performances: chris bisson and peter ash are attractive men and play their roles well, albeit without any indication at all of a loving relationship (the director seems terrified of showing the least suggestion of intimacy between the two men); sally bankes provides most of the laughs as vanessa; the rest of the cast repeat the stereotype roles they've played countless times in indian movies. this is not a bad film - it has its moments - but it is just too superficial and tired to make us care about any of the characters.

the plot for a movie such of this is a giveaway. how can you go wrong with a gay plot line and all the colors and music of india - a story like this writes itself. i'll watch most anything, but this was unwatchable. the sad thing is, the white folks are the most colorful in the film. vanessa was a riot with a mouth like a sailor, and jack was great eye candy, but everyone else was so boring. saeed jeffrey, who was exceptional in my beautiful landrette, did what he could but the story was so boring. the saving grace was really the background music, which made it ok to laugh at the film, instead of with the film, or not at all. there are many other better gay movies, ethnic movies, just plain movies. i give a lot of low budget movies a pass, but this shouldn't have been made, or should have been made by someone else.

another bad spanish picture. this is very baaaad. i only save the photography and the music of josé nieto. the rest of the film is the worst i've seen in years. paz vega is horrible. don't see it.

another pretentious film from vicente aranda. if "juana la loca" shinned of the same, at least its quality was superior (mainly thanks to the great performance of pilar lópez de ayala), but "carmen" is boring and full of topics (ardent brunette with a dagger in the stocking, poor man dragged to madness due to passion, sierra nevada gangs, "toreros",...)obviously paz vega is a pretty woman, but about its talent there're more doubts, and sbaraglia role is so stupid that results almost incredible. the script is weak and and aranda's presumptuous character influences the entire film. with these ingredients the result could not be good.not the worst film i've seen, but a complete failure, in my opinion.

dull acting, weak script...worst spanish movie in years...i wasattracted by the (naked) beauty of paz vega, but as an actressshe's useless, you almost can't understand what she's saying...about the story there's not much coherent to say...we heard of itbefore, but as this is a "modern carmen" we find a few changes: -the french soldier is now a basque soldier. -merimee himself is a character in the story. -carmen is a dangerous "bandolera" in love with a famous"matador" and she can speak fluent basque...can anyone understand this mess?

upon renting this, i wasn't expecting to be blown away. in fact, i knew it was going to be horrible. it was just seeing how horrible it really was. that's what comes with low budget horror."snakes on a train", not to be confused with the serpentine summer blockbuster "snakes on a plane" with samuel l. jackson, is about a woman who is put under a mayan curse that causes snakes to hatch inside her and devour her from within. her only hope of surviving lies in a shaman that lives across the border, so she and her companion stowaway onto a train bound for los angelas. throw in a few passengers and hilarity ensues.come to think of it, though, the story isn't half bad. isn't half good, either.the acting in this film rivals that of a sci-fi original, if not worse. trust me, it's horrible. the snakes were another problem. they were supposed to be rattlers, i guess, but most of what you get instead are mostly harmless garden snakes that don't attack anything and there's this rattling sound effect that gets really annoying.the gore effects on the other hand, while not on the tom savini level, were actually pretty good.and another thing, the ending alone makes up for the rest of the movie. i'm not going to talk about it here, so you'll have to rent this and see for yourself.

snakes on a train starts as mexican couple brujo (a.j. castro) & alma (julia ruiz) cross the boarder into the us, they then illegally board a seventeen hour train to los angeles. however alma's family didn't approve of her & brujo's relationship & placed an ancient black magic curse on her that turns all her insides into snakes, ain't life a b*tch? as the snakes pour out of alma's mouth & slither away to other parts of the train they begin to infect the other passengers with the same unusual ailment...edited & directed by the mallachi brothers (although the imdb claims it's just one guy using a pseudonym, peter mervis) one has to say that i thought snakes on a train was crap, it's as simple as that really. it seems the entire film was set-up & made to cash in on the samuel l. jackson cult flick snakes on a plane (2006) by every horror fans least favourite production company the asylum who specialise in ripping-off big budget hollywood flicks & that style of money & film-making is no more evident than here with snakes on a train, making a film just because the title rhymes with a more successful film is not a good starting point. the script by eric forsberg is rubbish, for a start snakes on a plane was great fun whereas snakes on a train is a lot more serious & when you actually break it down & look at it this should have been much more light hearted. in fact it probably would have worked better as an scary movie (2000) type spoof. you know something, i am struggling to find one positive thing to say about snakes on a train it's that bad. for a start the character's are rubbish & it's impossible to emote with anyone, the story is downright awful & makes no sense (if people spew all those small snakes up where did the huge ones come from? why did alma turn into the giant snake at the end? why did bujo kill the train driver? how was he going to stop the train once it reached los angeles? where did that typhoon come from at the end?), it takes itself far too seriously, the first seventy odd minutes is so boring & uneventful i am surprised i stayed awake & it's just a very, very poor film on just about every level.director mervis only has a few train carriage car sets which all look pretty much alike so the film becomes very repetitive & dull to watch. there's barely any blood or gore, there are some snakes borrowing under a few peoples skin, someone gets shot & that's about it. the special effects are rubbish too, the giant cgi snake at the end is truly awful & the least said about it the better. it's not scary, there's zero atmosphere & it's a bit of a bore from start to finish. the real live snakes are a problem too, they are just so docile & nonthreatening. if you look at any scene featuring a real snake & an actor the snakes never make any move towards them or act aggressively & in fact always appear to want to slither away in the opposite direction.shot in california technically the film is obviously low budget & it show's, basically it looks cheap because it is. the acting isn't great not that the actor's are given any sort of material to work with.snakes on a train is rubbish, i am sorry but that's how i feel & i don't quite know how else to describe it. i really can't see what anyone would get out of watching snakes on a train, it really is that bad.

there are spoilers but trust me, i'm doing you a favor.my friends and i like to watch crappy movies every so often. inspired by mystery science theater and our knack for on the spot jokes; we set out to find movies worth watching that are in fact...not worth watching. however trouble comes into paradise when these movies can only be found if you buy them. and i am a firm believer in not giving one cent to such a group of talentless scumbags. so, as another reviewer has said, films like this are a reason why downloading movies for free should be legalized. i prefer the idea of; instead of straight to video you have straight to internet. that way the ass-bags who made this travesty won't ever turn a profit. which unfortunately you know they do. they hire a bunch of actors who can't act, special effects from a high school classroom, rubber snakes you can get at the dollar store, constant vomiting of green jell-o, and the two main characters who seem to switch between being border jumping mexicans who only speak spanish, to arabs to being 100% fluent in english, random nudity, a guy being shot like 10 times including one to the side of the head and living and the most retarded ending in the history of film, book, cave drawings and hustler magazine. the fact that i actually predicted that the jell-o puking snake girl would actually transform into a snake about half way through terrifies me...anyways, the movie is great to make fun of, but you have to make sure there's at least 4 of you and you're all spitting out jokes in rapid fire, because if there's even 1 second of watching this movie where you're not laughing your ass off, you will feel physically ill. i kid you not. my friends and i were eating chicken wings and now i can't even look at such a thing anymore without being reminded of this piece of sh!t.this film is one above alien vs. hunter which is by far the second worst movie ever made. and i've seen lots of bad movies. incidentally, it's the same production company as this film and that bald guy is in both as well. just thought you might like to know that little fun fact. -100 out 0f 10.

oh. good. grief.i saw this movie title in the tv schedules and thought "i must watch this movie, ripping off snakes on a plane, it will be terrible but hopefully laughable too. sounds fantastically bad". well, i was half right.this movie is eye-meltingly bad and, sadly, not even unintentionally hilarious. it's just bad. even worse, it takes almost an hour to get to anything resembling action. for the first half of the movie we have to endure some mumbled foreign language (mexican or spanish, apologies for my ignorance) and terrible acting as some woman vomits up live snakes for reasons we only find out later on. then we have to endure even more terrible acting, and we find out that those mumbling in the foreign language could speak english anyway, as the snakes finally get loose on the train and things move from the sedate to the ridiculous.low-budget does not always mean "bad" but, in this case, it does. what we have here is a movie given no thought, a terrible script, a bad cast and not even the sense to capitalise on it's very few strengths. i give two marks for a few decent special effects and a whacky ending but that still feels a bit too generous. avoid if you can.see this if you like: stagknight, the wicker man remake, terrible cgi.

warner brothers social responsibility at its most ham-handed, with sermonizing every five minutes or so about how we're americans, we don't run from trouble, we face up to our responsibilities. it also suggests that if you're willing to perjure yourself to protect your family from clearly deadly gangsters, you're un-american. walter huston, looking bored, is the frustrated da, and the "average american family" includes such familiar faces as sally blane (looking a lot like her sister, loretta young) and dickie moore, as an allegedly adorable moppet. both are regularly crowded out of the frame by chic sale, only 47 then but playing an octogenarian civil war veteran, ponderously jumping and "amusingly" nipping at prohibition hooch and moralizing about how we're americans, dag nabbit. his st. vitus dance old-coot performance is tiresome schtick; it's like walter brennan based his entire career on it. william wellman directs efficiently and quickly, much like his earlier "public enemy," but he and the screenwriter neglect to show what happens to this family after the happy fadeout -- i.e., they'd probably be rubbed out by the mob.

aside from a few good moments of fairly raw violence, this painful film is most notable for making 68 minutes seem like two hours.it starts with an interminably long intro where the leeds family is introduced, including two insufferable tykes and their adult brother and sister, completely clichéd pa and ma, and incredibly annoying grandpa (played by charles "chic" sales). while sitting down to dinner the family is disturbed by the sounds of gunfire, and rushes to the window in time to see two men gunned down by mobsters in the street. the mobsters flee through the family's house, leaving them as witnesses to the crime.the rest of the movie consists of walter huston as the crusading da occasionally interrupting long anti-crime speeches to make half hearted attempts at trying to protect the family from the mob. it all winds up in a predictable manner.good points about the movie include a couple of decent shootouts and a truly nasty beating, nat pendleton as one of the mobsters, and the gorgeous sue blane in a small role as the leeds daughter. if you want to watch huston play his early trademark crusading lawman, try 1932's "beast of the city." avoid this one if at all possible.

all those who criticize the sopranos for its stereotypical portrayals of italians haven't seen anything until they've gotten a good look at this cornball gangster film which focuses on a family so irritating, you almost want them to be rubbed out.the parents in this clan aren't so bad, but their two little boys--one a total brat, one cloyingly cutesy-poo--are insufferable, while their older good-for-nothing son and pollyanna daughter ably compete for audience contempt. but the granddaddy of them all is, well, granddaddy. as played by chic sale (in full "dag-nabbit!" mode) he serves as the films moral compass, throwing in lots of diatribes about "dang, dirty foreigners" for good measure. if these are the good guys, it's no wonder the actors of that era who played baddies became the big stars.not that there are any stellar performances to be found among the criminal actors, but they at least acquit themselves better than the grating leeds family. the incompetent police officers aren't even given enough screen time to bring things down any further. only walter huston, as the district attorney, elevates the cliché-riddled material in his futile attempts to breathe some levelheadedness into these dolts.the film deserves credit for being an early entry in what would prove to be a very popular silencing-the-witness formula, and it doesn't flinch in its depiction of the hard-bitten underworld lifestyle, but there are quite simply better--and less xenophobic--examples in the genre.

a few of my fellow writers have covered this movie's plot elements so i will stick to some of the cuff remarks...1. this is entertaining - but not for the reasons you'd think. it's cheesy but somehow still watchable.2. tamra, daniel's love interest has to be about thirty. the christian girl that dan ignores is way cuter.3. muriel stole his shirt from mr. spock. also, if my guardian angel looks like muriel i'm going to have to apply for a transfer.4. okay... so apparently... dan is responsible for his parents' divorce! what kind of horrible guilt trip is that?! muriel says that it was dan's prayers that kept his parents together. i just thought that was absolutely ridiculous. listen, i can pray for my parents as much as i want but the only way they'll stay together is if they decide they're going to do it.5. i'll echo the atheist's comments on how this movie portrays non-christians. apparently they're all slovenly bullies.6. for something positive - david white is a decent actor. he gives the movie a little bit of credibility, even if he is the only one. he pretty much holds this film together on his own.

while everyone does a decent job in this film, i agree with the other comment: it's too loose and scattered, too much like a script-less experiment with really talented actors. as such, it isn't enough to hold your attention. having said that, there are a few really funny moments, one involving dylan mcdermott and a flaming shot glass that i think anyone who's been that drunk would find as funny as i did; the other is a split-second with an inflatable dinosaur. crispin glover does his usual nutty twitch-fest guy and does it fine, harry dean stanton does his usual nutty patriarch (repo man, anyone?) etc. good cast, not enough to keep it going. just a few gems, seconds long.

man, are you serious? did you read the book or watch this movie? well, if you did, let me warn you, it is bogus. mark furhman has been seeking a job since losing his job with the lapd. you remember him, don't you? he was the guy that lied on the stand and gave the oj simpson defense a foothold they were looking for. well, he has written three books since then. i have read all three of them. no, i am not a fan, they were given to me. however, i will tell you one similarity in all three, they grossly distort the importance of mark furhman. he shamelessly exaggerates his stature in all three. in "murder in spokane", he pretends that he had something to do with catching the killer, when he had nothing to do with it. in all books he takes great delight in running down local law enforcement efforts. kind of like his efforts were run down in the oj trial. in this movie, there are plenty of slow motion shots of ladies looking at furhman and lusting after him. many other shots have him at the center of attention, when in reality, i am sure the only thing people were thinking at the time was "hey, isn't that the racist that caused oj to get off?" this was an interesting real life story, but not a good movie over it.

i can't believe it! were they crazy in filming a movie about connecticut in southern california? for god's sake, there's palm tree's everywhere. in one of the opening scenes a guy says "welcome to connecticut" and throws down a newspaper, the newspaper says something like "greenwich herald". greenwich connecticut doesn't have a "herald" it has a "times" as in "stamford advocate and the greenwich times." (refering to the stamford, connecticut newspaper). maybe the film makers should have done a little research, i mean my god, at least get the name of the newspaper right, or film in locations that look at least remotely like connecticut.

this movie is trash because, out of many reasons, it is based on mark furman's book, which is also trash. let me must say that mark furhman is a racist pig that is just looking for another way to get himself into the spotlight - and others that right this type of trash belong in jail. for the movie itself, being based on the book, was horrible as well. the only reason that this murder case became such a big book and movie was because the guy is related, thru his aunts marriage, to the kennedy family and it is ridiculous that people still believe that this family somehow has the ability to make and cover up murders - they are just a family and middle america needs to get over the obsession. this poor guy, and his family, have been hounded by the police for years, they couldn't get tommy so they went after micheal. its amazing that he went to jail with all the evidence that supports that he didn't do it, besides the facts that the statute of limitations, among other things, should have kept this trial from being brought back after twenty years for the love of god, don't watch this garbage

i was so disappointed in this movie. i am very familiar with the case, having read not only mark fuhrman's book but also the far superior "a wealth of evil: the true story of the murder of martha moxley in america's richest community" by timothy dumas. anyone who watches murder in greenwich should be aware they're watching the mark fuhrman story, not the martha moxley story. this film is nothing more than an ego-trip for fuhrman. just watch his character strut around as if he is the second coming (yes, even being ogled by women). the actors playing the kids look way too old for their roles and the flashbacks to the 1970s are totally unconvincing. if there is any hero to this story, it's martha's family, her mother dorothy and brother john. they kept this case alive for two decades before fuhrman walked into it in order to make a name for himself. they, and martha, deserve to have the true story told.

i just saw princess raccoon at the asian film festival in new york. the gentleman who introduced the film congratulated the audience on their fine taste. "you could be at herbie: fully loaded," he said with a smug smile, "but instead you're here to watch seijun suzuki's princess raccoon." the audience applauded and cheered. well let me tell you, i would have rather watched herbie: fully loaded twice in a row. princess raccoon, an allegedly whimsical musical based on japanese folklore, easily qualifies for one of the ten worst films that i have ever seen. it is so wretched that its wretchedness actually makes me dislike other seijun suzuki films, which is quite a feat.there is such a vast expanse of things wrong with princess raccoon that i hardly know where to start. perhaps its worst faults are being both aggressively unintelligible and mind bogglingly monotonous. if the reels got mixed up or if half of them got lost in shipping the audience would not know the difference. if you don't believe me i dare you to steal a print and have someone run the reels in random order. if you can tell me which one goes where i will give you every penny i have.the first third of the film features a mishmash of scenes, songs (including a cringe inducing rap number), and images that don't seem to be related in any way at all. horribly integrated computer animation is thrown into the bargain, adding yet another brick to the immense, and rapidly growing, wall of incomprehensibility. it wouldn't surprise me to learn that the writer wrote down any japanese folklore that came to mind of on a bunch of note cards, stacked them up, shuffled them, dealt the cards out on a table, and then wrote the script according to their order.about thirty-five minutes into the film some semblance of a plot arrives on the scene. something about a shape-shifting raccoon princess (in human form) and a regular human falling in love. i hoped that this was be a portent of the film being something other than a series of perplexing scenes, but no such luck. the film continues in the same absolutely baffling manner. i wish i had gotten out then, but i was trapped in the middle of a narrow row. in retrospect it would have been worth the awkward scene.i'm exhausted just thinking about the last couple of reels. i spent every moment hoping and praying that it would be over. every big dolly move, swell in music, or scene that looked remotely like it was concluding things renewed my hopes that the credits were about to roll. for agonizing minute after agonizing minute it went on. and on and on and on. finally, after dozens of false alarms, it cut to what i was sure must be an abstract pattern over which credits were about to appear. then, in defiance of all reason, it cut to another scene. how could i forget? the completely unrelated subplot concerning a ninja being captured, urinated on, and boiled in a soup hadn't been wrapped up yet.i'm never going to get those 111 minutes back, but you can spare yourself the pain. unless you want to taint your memory or future enjoyment of great seijun suzuki films like youth of the beast and tokyo drifter do not see princess raccoon. i would have rather spent my time vomiting.

weird with unnecessary singing and backdrops. randomly much of the action will occur on stage giving the feeling of an opera performance. none of that explains why this is such a bad film.it's the impression that either not enough rehearsal took place or that no experienced choreographer was available. the acting is flat. even the sparkling ziyi zhang looks like she's just waiting for her next movement or line. you may notice the trivia on this site stating that she spent half a month in japan learning to sign and dance. read that again as 2 weeks and things begin to make sense. even worse are the little kids who seem to be looking at their parents at the back of the studio rather than at the camera.the cheap and cheerful sfx are just cheap and cheap. the editing is staccato chops peppered with slices of just nothing that adds to anything except annoyance. just imagine all the silly dance scenes from the recent zatoichi - particularly the closing routine - performed by your local high school drama club with one famous actress who speaks in another language (but you get her in simply because she's so good normally despite being unsuitable), recorded on a cheap camera and then edited into three times its length in no artful order.

this movie starts off promisingly enough, but it gets a little to convoluted and caught up in its stylistic charm. the set designs, costumes, and music were wonderful- as close to perfect as one can get. but the more i got into the movie, the more i felt like all this effort was for the director's entertainment, not the audience. although, i loved looking at it, except for a few brief musical scenes, i can't say i enjoyed it. the director shows enormous imagination, but if he had fun with this film, he failed to share that with the audience, or at least with me. i didn't get a sense of whimsy and i didn't get sucked into this universe.a big cause of this was (surprisingly) zhang ziyi. you can tell she's trying very hard, but she seems to have been so miscast that she comes off almost amateurish. she's a capable actress but she has her limitations. i've noticed in her acting, that she has yet to truly react to her fellow co-stars, a flaw that creates a void of chemistry. the language barrier in this film seems to have only exacerbate matters. she and odagiri act as if they're on separate planets. she's also not a very good singer which made me cringe every time she sang, but thankfully there weren't too many scenes of that. odagiri was ok but doesn't make much of an impression.i didn't even care for the characters separately. there really is a sore lack of characterization. the only reason to care about them seems to be that they're good-looking royalty. without the compelling love story at the center of the film though, it's hard to care what happens. the film also takes detours into minor scenes that added nothing to the story and was actually distracting. i had to rewind because after going into a subplot i couldn't remember what the heck they we're doing in the main storyline. there were also scenes where it was hard to tell what the action occurring was because it was so stylized.mostly i'm just disappointed because i really like the concept behind this and there are a lot of things i do like. the music and dance choreography are really great.the supporting performances are uniformly excellent, fantastic in both the acting aspect and the singing. it's just too bad the lead actors were so bland.

i think the problem with some reactions to this film is that - with few exceptions - they don't focus on the main disconnect, hence the main split in the audience.on the one side, there are those who are taken by the visual design, pretty costumes, and variety of elements going into the film. some children's movie fans love the colour and animation, and all the un-scary 'magical' effects, shapeshifting animals, and so on. some culture vultures like the complicated references, the layerings of different folklore elements, and the fact that they can watch zhang ziyi singing and quasi-miming, in two different languages, in what really was intended to be a children's comedy.on the other side, there are those who say that a children's movie should still have a point, that a blend of folktales is not a tale at all, and that it's easier to believe in magic when enough thought and care has gone into the technical aspects to make it seem real.in other words, the ideas could be lovely; but when you put them onstage they have to deliver. here, they don't.a good folktale - from any country - has a clear story, a point, and characters who interact strongly with each other. this lacks them all. a few over-sophisticated gestures to opera, western and japanese, are no replacement for a solid theme.as a fantasy fan, i must say that i've sat through some turkeys and loved a few, but this one really tries to do too many things - cheaply. putting in zhang ziyi to try to add a little glitter smacks of exotic flower syndrome. the other problem isn't that there's no plot; there's half a plot, which means that you keep getting pulled in, then dropped again as another none-too-sharply-executed dance number kicks off.the characters all seem to know that they're starring in a movie. unless you really like watching other peoples' amateur video, this ain't good. i'd like to test this on real children; i think they'd drop it for uproar in heaven after about 20 minutes.

sherlock holmes and the secret weapon starts in switzerland as the world's foremost detective sherlock holmes (basil rathbone) outwits the nazi's & manages to smuggle a brilliant scientist named dr. franz tobel (william post jr.) out of the country & to the relative safety of london. but is london as safe as holmes thinks? dr. tobel has engineered a revolutionary new bomb sight that will change aerial bombardment forever & he has agreed to give it to the british government, but those nazi's want it just as badly & holmes arch enemy professor moriarty (lionel atwill) plans on stealing the secret of the bomb sight & selling it to the nazi's. add the bumbling inspector lestrade (denis hoey) of scotland yard, dr. tobel's love interest charlotte eberli (kaaren verne), assassins, mysterious scientists & a puzzling coded message & holmes has his work cut out to keep dr. tobel alive so he can deliver his bomb sight...directed by roy william neill sherlock holmes and the secret weapon was the fourth in a series of fourteen holmes films made between 1939 & 1946 to feature rathbone & bruce as holmes & watson. the script by edward t. lowe jr., scott darling & edmund l. hartmann is based on the short 'the dancing men' by sir arthur conan doyle & isn't the tradition holmes murder mystery as it's more of a wartime adventure story. to neglect what holmes is all about, the solving of complex crimes & mysteries is a big mistake as far as i'm concerned & the involvement of the nazi's & the war as a backdrop to the story feels out of place, awkward & just didn't sit too well with me. the dialogue isn't great, professor moriarty feels almost like an afterthought as if they couldn't come up with a villain for it & as a whole it's far less engaging than other's in the series. however, at least it's short.director neill does his usual efficient job but you have to cut it a little slack & bear in mind that it was made over 60 years ago. it has no real style or imagination & lacks both atmosphere & intrigue as well.technically the film is ok if unspectacular, the black and white cinematography is fine although i understand that a computer colourised version is also available. the acting is alright, bruce & hoey do their usual comic relief turns & rathbone's hairstyle in this looks ridiculous & i'm glad he changed it for later instalments.sherlock holmes and the secret weapon was a disappointment when compared to some of the other excellent entries in the series, there is very little by which i can recommend it & everything that made the other's so good seems to be missing here. leave this one till last & watch some of the better ones first, for die hard fans only.

abysmal indonesian action film from legendary arizal triumphantly sculpts a template for future cinemax pap like 'china o'brien' and 'do or die' with erik estrada while simultaneously burying poor rising action star pat o'brien with a hackneyed backyard script and three cans of hair-styling gel to perm his impressive 1984 mullet. this guy's physical prowess resembles a more femme mark gregory and his next credit would be second fiddle to chris mitchum as "tom selick." powerful. at least the action is mindless and non-stop with some daring asian stuntmen risking their lives for what is essentially a poorly constructed movie by teens and/or meth addicts with no concept of reality. one poor extra gets gorno-ly shredded by an electric hedge clipper and many more are killed by getting hit in the head by odd objects such as a motorcycle wheel or cardboard box. classic rape scenes are tasteless and priceless and quotable dialog such as, "i would rather trust a rattlesnake!" are delivered with such exuberance and fervor from the third-rate polizioteschi voice actors. random highlight: some crazy dude eating live lizards. movie also holds the record for most cars driven through walls. 2/10

anyone who will pay to see troma movies knows, and appreciates, what they are going to get. having said that, i didn't think it was possible to make a movie this bad, and still be compelling. i found myself watching just to see how much worse it could get before the end. first off, it's an indonesian action movie with an american main character who looks and acts like the bastard son of "taxi"'s christopher lloyd and rambo. he puts posters of himself dressed up like sly's "cobra" all over the place and even has a custom built firing range (with action-posed cutouts of his greatest enemies)in jakarta although he's in the cia and has just arrived days earlier. there is a lot of action involving gun-play(no muzzle-flashes on those m-16s, only sound effects), motorcycles(that bust through walls), karate(where no one makes physical contact) and even some sex(where all the actors are ugly). the main plot of an epic like this should at least be reasonably plausible, but not here. it involves the world's most dangerous drug cartel going all out to find a "drug detector device". why would they need it? that is never revealed, why not kill drug-sniffing dogs? makes no sense, but, it is taken seriously. the actors are to be commended because they really seemed to think this movie would make them all famous and tried hard to "act". best line? "now dance to your grave you dirty whore!" best scene? rambo jumps onto flying helicopter, pulls machine gun out of baddie's hand, let's go, falls, shoots helicopter as he's falling, helicopter blows up, cut to mannequin thrown in water. f**king genius! if you can't appreciate trash, don't watch it. if you can, it's awesome. one last thing, did i mention it was directed by the three punjabi brothers?

on a flight back from london, i watched she's the man; apparently air canada has a crap movie policy. perhaps that's not the best way to start a review of this movie. amanda bynes plays a girl who loves soccer so much that she pretends to be her twin brother to get on a team at a boarding school across town. even if you check your mind at the door (on a 6 hour flight you have to), the story is implausible and ridiculous. there are some moments of humor, mostly from comedian david cross as the principle, but the intricate love polygon doesn't really inspire emotion, although is is cleverly mixed (with the caveat of mindless plausibility). the ending is just as ridiculously mindless as the rest. i guess if i was a 12-year-old girl, i might have really enjoyed this one.

this movie was different from most of jimmy cangey's films of the 1930s in that it was not done by warner brothers/first national, but was a loan-out to a smaller studio. because it was a "poverty row" studio, the production values are lower than you might be used to seeing with cagney films. plus, the plot is certainly one of the strangest i have seen. instead of him being a gangster, he was a good guy in this one--fighting for the law. this isn't all that unusual because cagney frequently played lawmen--such as an oss leader (the forefather of the cia) of fbi agent. but, to make him an investigator for the bureau of weights and measures was indeed odd--especially since, at times, he acted pretty much the same way he did in the movie g-men! all in all, a time passer and that's about it.finally, the videotape i saw this on from memory lane video was perhaps one of the poorest i have ever encountered. the sound was terrible and scratchy and the print looked very white and had lots of torn film and gaps.

first off, this is the worst movie i've ever seen. that may make you want to see it, but it is not bad in a good way. it's boring, implausible, poorly shot, ridiculously scripted, and lacking in cool disaster effects.worse, it is intensely patriotic without a trace of irony or fun, wallowing in a sense of japanese uniqueness and victimhood. everyone abandons the japanese in their hour of need. particularly the koreans. the most noble characters choose seppaku -- going down with their ship as their beloved island sinks. "only japanese would think this way," says the prime minister.if this movie in any way reflects the japanese opinion of their place in world opinion, the first thing they should do to rectify the problem is stop making movies like this.

i have just finished watching this movie, and for me.... it takes ages to finish because it is so boring.....and the storyline is extremely bad.now... where should i start....o.... the movie is called "sinking of japan" ....yeah yeah... it does show that japan is actually sinking but the action part is very bad. compare to the movie "the day after tomorrow" i would have rate it at least 8/10.the "sinking of japan" does not show much about the disaster that actually happening right in front of our eyes. there isn't much excitement at all...boring... all i can say...one more point... i would recommend this movie to have a better title... maybe something like "the romance of sinking of japan" because this movie does have lots of talkings (waste of time... talk nonsense) & the love story is extremely boring & have been dragging too long...honestly.. i almost get frustrated.overall... this movie does not show enough details of the disasters e.g. many people running like hell to avoid death..love story part was extremely not touching enough for me.but hey... there is one thing we should appreciate about this movie though.... & its has got good songs!

due to rather dubious plate tectonics, japan starts to slip under the sea. initial predictions say it'll take about 40 years before the country is submerged, but a rogue scientist adds in some even more dubious science and determines it will actually take less than 1 year! the government think he's a crackpot, but evidence soon starts bearing his theory out.this big budget disaster movie follows the formula set by any number of hollywood films of the late 90's (i assume, having seen none of them), with the scale of disaster and tragedy bringing out the nobility of the human (well, japanese) spirit in acts of heroism and sacrifice, and proving the power of love or something like that. i.e. it's as naive in its psychology as it's geology... we all know that half the populace would be out raping and looting the minute they thought the police had their back turned, and the other half would just panic and be useless.the film does have some very nice special effects, but is not as slick or expensive looking as an equivalent hollywood production would be. it is at least as nationalistic, humourless and lacking in self-awareness as that hollywood film would be though, and probably has even worse acting. it does have the hot evil chick from battle royale as one of the leads... but she's not even slightly evil, and is therefore much less hot.the film is much too long at 132 minutes, and gets worse and worse as it progresses towards a conclusion that had me in danger of puking. i certainly didn't care in the slightest whether japan sank or not by the half way point, and well before the end i was trying to think of ways to expedite the process should i ever find myself in that situation for real.but, it does have nice special effects, and kou shibasaki is still pretty hot, so i magnanimously give it... 3/10.

this disaster flick is a remake of a 1973 movie of the same title, based on a novel by sakyo komatsu. japan is located right alongside the pacific ring of fire (active volcanoes) and also along the edges of plate tectonics, whose shifting will cause earthquakes and tsunamis (a japanese term in itself for tidal wave). naturally, this makes a natural premise for a disaster picture, what with hollywood having a field day with films like armageddon, deep impact, and more recently, the day after tomorrow, which tackles how global warming becomes the catalyst for natural disasters gone bonkers around the world.but i'll have to say this: the sinking of japan makes all the films mentioned earlier, look like classics. this disaster movie is a disaster, and a massive one at that. having to look at my watch every 10-15 minutes is a signal that the movie doesn't engage, and feels than it had over-clocked its runtime.the special effects are gorgeous to look at. from satellite styled outer space pictures, to the vivid recreation of every conceivable natural disaster that can strike the land of the rising sun, the effects are the star of the show. however, having spectacular computer generated graphics does not in itself make a movie palatable, as too much of a good thing just plain bores.if you had seen the trailer where you're enticed by the effects and specific scenes of chaos and mayhem, then yes, in fact those scenes are just that. there are no details, and everything is seen from afar, in a god-like mode. things happen just like that on screen, with nary an attempt to try and delve deeper to look at issues up close. it's akin to godzilla knocking over buildings, and it's as if there are no humans or loss of lives through that single act. morbid as it might sound, show us the victims! a populous nation like japan doesn't just suffer disaster after disaster with an extremely low fatality count, not when the filmmakers unleash mayhem in such an epic scale.trying to weave a romance into the movie, it stood out like a sore thumb. there are many characters in the movie, but each one of them lacking real characteristics, or humanity, and look like wandering zombies, without expression, without emotion, and definitely very stiff and unconvincing. heroes become stuck in generic control rooms issuing statements, instructions and form policies, and react to incidents like it was a computer game, all settled with a push of a button. these are characters that you don't give a hoot about.if i may just use the day after tomorrow as a comparison, while there are terrific effects, there is at least an attempt to provide a microscopic view of the entire disaster from different individual's point of views. and infused within are plenty of action sequences, big ones like the disasters themselves, and small ones with the focus on the triumph of the human spirit, that makes it relatively compelling.unfortunately for the sinking of japan, this movie should preferably be one to sink and tank, and hopefully undergo a short and quick death at the local box office to make way for better stuff.

this film has some nice special effects, tearing apart the japanese archipelago to a degree that would humble godzilla. the two leads also put in above-par performances. apart from that, it is all a bit ropey in this understated disaster flick. the incongruities in the pacing are bizarre. at one point we have hokkaido sinking into the sea and pyroclastic snow falling on the rest of japan, while osaka is buried under an immense tsunami. yet elsewhere in the country, people are still strolling around sightseeing and licking ice-cream when another tsunami rolls in... kusanagi also manages to travel great distances without any hindrance, or even a crease in his cream shirt. other people turn up with burns, ripped clothes and mud-streaks on their faces. the japaneseness of the film is both touching and repugnant. kusanagi's sacrifice in his final evening with shibasaki is a touch of chivalry seldom seen in this genre these days. however, the ill-fated pms musings on the japanese psyche and the seduction of death, and the fact that japan is abandoned by everyone and has no friends in the last instance, hint at a darker paranoia that infects japanese concerns regarding their status in the world.sadly, the final sequence is a rip-off of armaggedon, edited with a cookie-cutter.finally, my own particular bug-bear - the heavy handed product placement for cigarettes. this time around, it is mad(-or-is-he?) scientist toyokawa who gets to be the poster boy for japan tobacco. at one point, he manages to light up 5000 meters below the ocean surface, in a miniature sub the size of a phone box. gimme a break.

may be spoilers so do not read if you do not want to just like watching the tv news , everything is already happened, a great tsunami looms over a city bay and cut , no more to see, tokay suffers a large earthquake , did anyone see more than the 5 seconds i saw? if you want to make a love story , make a love story but if you want to use a disaster movie title , do please be kind enough to show me the disaster , pd after watching this movie watch jishin retto or any godzilla film to satisfy the part that was willing to see people screaming and buildings collapsing that did not get a chance to do in this movie. don t take me wrong i love disaster movies and i love the original nihon chimbotsu and jishin retto, i even like the latest poseidon , not to much of a story there but a very good and graphic disaster sequence , new nihon chimbotsu looses the point as many times as pearl harbour or the day after tomorrow but at least this two movies do show good disaster sequences, and also enough with the expensive fx that did not show anything , give me fake buildings if you like as long as you do destroy them properly , i know i must sound like a sadistic freak, however i did go to see love actually when i felt like going to see a romantic film , grrrrrrr even kimpachi sensei makes me cry and this movie didn:t . there is also a tv series called napping chimbotsu made in 1975, i have on dvd and it is much better

what a terrible movie! it represents perfectly the state of degenerateness of french society, where the most elementary respect for wholesome values and traditions has completely disappeared. the plot is nonsensical, the movie is not funny at all and the characters are completely shallow and uninteresting. to say the least, the direction and the cinematography are very poor and uninspired. catherine deneuve is as bad an actress as she always was, even when she was directed by bunuel in belle de jour. the rest of the usually good cast (vincent lindon, line renaud, jean yanne) seem completely lost in an ocean of vulgarity, platitudes and restlessness. i cannot help to draw a parallel with the wonderful james ivory's "le divorce", with its thoughtful depiction of french and american mores, its superlative cinematography and stellar cast put to good use. having watched "le divorce" you can feel a kind of empathy with the french, regardless of their foibles. "belle-maman" leaves you with only a nauseated contempt for its morally bankrupt and clueless protagonists.

i rented the matrix revisited with a friend of mine. we both loved the matrix and we both love filmmaking so we wanted to see what was going on behind the scenes of the matrix. it turns out that the matrix revisited tells you hardly anything about the art of filmmaking or even how the matrix was made. it is basically a huge commercial for the matrix, a movie that the target audience of the matrix revisited has already seen!if you really want to know about the process and the troubles and the stress and the detail that went into making of the matrix, look no further than the bonus features on the original dvd of the matrix. there are things they show in those documentaries that i had not even realized had to be done or was done. the matrix was such a difficult and challenging film to make that it deserves more credit than a "documentary" that's about as informative and interesting as an mtv special.

the patriot (nothing to do with the mel gibson film of the same name) came out steven seagal was still doing that 'saving the environment' thing in his movies. which is fine. but it doesn't make for good action.when the plot(?) of this film finally kicked in i saw the twist(?) coming a mile off. seagal's anti-warfare, care-for-mother-nature stance is not very subtle. for a film that was originally going to debut in the cinemas it is shot very much like a tv movie despite some wonderful shots of the country by dean semler, the photographer of dances with wolves.steven seagal does like 1 fight scene in the entire film and it's totally boring. as an action film it fails, as a drama it stinks, as an environmental message it's obvious. avoid like ebola crossed with plague.

"the patriot" staring steven segal is a late 90's thriller/action movie that is not really a thriller and not really an action movie; rather it is steven segal playing steven segal by another name, but this time he is a native american country doctor who kicks butt every now an again. baring the obvious plot line holes, the movie itself is absolutely amazing in terms of the blatant disregard for character devolvement. from a marketing standpoint, i was left asking myself, "who in the world were they aiming at?" the bio-thriller plot-line is way off the mark for the middle america crowd and segal as silk cowboy would never sell to anyone even if you deep fried him and put him between a kripsy-cream donut. the whole movie is just way out there, even for segal fans, because it simply does not deliver on any level.

i caught this film late at night on hbo. talk about wooden acting, unbelievable plot, et al. very little going in its favor. skip it.

i saw this at the toronto inter. film festival in sept. 2005. the description seemed intriguing--how wrong i was! this could easily be the worst movie i have ever seen--in 50 years! i see the director is my age (b. 1948) and lived with nico of the velvet underground, which leads us to andy warhol, which coincidently is the one i thought of while watching this--warhol's 24+ hour movies of nothing much happening. this is not art, this is boredom.specifically: black & white. ok, maybe...but what is the purpose here? surely they had color in 1968! and there is no contrast with the present. and yes, the subtitles were in white, naturally. i don't think i missed much, but that made about 20% of them illegible.next, it's pure chronological order, but with seemingly random events thrown in. what's the purpose of the conversation with the old man at the dinner table? it adds nothing to the movie. there were many similar scenes--almost like someone took a camcorder and filmed random people and spliced them together to make a movie.plot? none. the "riot" consists of some figures in the distance occasionally heaving a rock off screen. mostly it's an excruciating length of time watching people (in the distance!) stand around. the repetitive opium smoking is just as boring. when the main character got a cute girlfriend, i perked up, but no, she was boring too! this is perhaps the only french film i've seen where no one takes off their clothes. probably they were too bored to bother.romance? none. the girl seems totally indifferent to everything--maybe her sculpture holds some interest, but if it does, we're not shown that. we are completely indifferent to the fate of the characters because they are all unappealing. maybe that's the point of all this?

watching this movie brings several words to mind: "sophomoric", "ridiculous", "improbable", "self-indulgent" and finally (and fatally), "boring". badly directed, badly photographed and badly acted, the film is a confusing mess with plot lines (if one can call them that) veering in all directions. someone may have used a five-year old's finger painting as a template. as punishment for this childish crime of a movie, this cast of "stars" should be spanked soundly and sent to their respective beds without dinner. . all in all, it seems like george needed an excuse to get together with his little buddies for a paid summer vacation and we're the suckers paying for it. bad george! bad!

comparing oceans twelve to the 2001 oceans eleven, did anyone else notice all the things that stayed the same?- all the stars returned for twelve, and zeta-jones was added;- twelve had the same director;- twelve had the same producers;- twelve had the same production designer;- twelve had the same music director;- twelve had the same film editor.did anyone notice the things than changed once the "oceans" franchise was established?- twelve's budget was $25 million (30%) greater;- eleven got great reviews, but twelve largely got panned;- eleven made $450 million but twelve dropped to $362 million;- domestic box office for twelve dropped 32%;- soderbergh teamed with a different screenwriter.movies are a director's medium, of course. i almost forgot.

i am a shakespeare lover since childhood. i am also a jew. merchant of venice is anti-semitic through and through no matter how hard scholars and literature lovers try to re-interpret it.in the play, shylock is portrayed as demonic and cold-hearted and has no forgiveness, no warmth, no love except for money and cruel revenge, whereas the christians are kind, moral people. his motives in the play revolve around money (he plots revenge from the start based on damage caused to his business as well as blind racial hate), not noble ideals or hurt racial pride as this movie wants you to believe. and this characterization is given to him by shakespeare himself, not by the other characters. as final proof, the happy ending is where the jew loses his money and is forced to convert to christianity.i acknowledge this and move on. it is part of history and i enjoy shakepeare despite this fact. therefore i expect a movie based on this play to play it straight. i would much rather see the work adapted for its rich language and storytelling without any whitewashing.but many of the the bard's artful subtleties and playful characters are lost in this movie. for example, in the last scene where the men discover portia's undercover work as a man who also took away their rings, instead of the playful game of words and misunderstandings as the truth reveals itself, it becomes a mean-spirited game where two bitchy women play cruelly with their soon-to-be husbands.so instead, we are only left with lovely detailed sets, fragments of the rich language with poor reinterpretation, poor casting, one intense courtroom scene, and a controversy.the truth is, i think it would be much easier to identify the anti-semitism in the story and move on if it were left as is. despite all the whitewashing the makers of this movie pulled out of their hats, there is plenty of hatred left, only now people can make excuses and pretend the portrayal of jews isn't so bad anymore.and finally, another problem is with most of the actors being miscast. pacino is way out of his league and is very uncomfortable with the language, not to mention the horribly fake accent. fiennes as bassanio is charmless and awkward with the language. irons is dependable as always but doesn't do much with his role. portia is somewhat ok but unlikeable, and covered in bad makeup, just like the movie.

i saw this film as a sneak preview before the venice opening at the telluride film festival. your reaction to it will largely depend on your attitude about respecting the text of shakespeare. on the plus side: pacino gives a very good performance indeed as shylock; lynn collins is a fine portia; and the film has a sumptuous look. the negatives are predictable. "the merchant of venice" is arguably the most difficult of all of shakespeare's plays to stage today, largely because we look at it through the distorting lens of 20th century history. the romantic plot with bassanio and portia presents no problem. the character of shylock does, because we lack the original frame of reference of the elizabethan audience. shylock is simultaneously a human character with human qualities and motivations, and an abstraction of the pitiless quality of the old law. when he says "hath not a jew eyes?" he is a character; when he proclaims "i will have my bond!" he is an abstraction. the long passage on music and cosmic harmony in the final scene (here moved and cut to ribbons) is the key to the play, in that it re-establishes universal harmony after the disruptive and evil (the shylock of the trial scene) forces are ejected. it is possible to make psychological sense of the character of shylock by showing his gradually going mad and turning into a monomaniac by the time the trial scene rolls around--the key is that at a point he must cease being sympathetic.pacino's performance almost does it, but not quite. the film can't quite make up its mind--on the one hand, there is the right movement in the character of shylock, and on the other there is a great deal of extraneous footage of jews being abused and venetian whores with rouged nipples (no doubt to show the decadence of antonio et al). shakespeare was not writing an ibsen-like social drama; he was writing a comedy following the classic pattern of disruption of social order and the restoration of social order, symbolized by marriage, with a theme of love versus law at the center of the shylock plot.in this sense, the film is a travesty--radford's surgery on the play and direction almost force us away from what the play really means. (taking the beginning of the final scene, cutting most of it, and moving it before the trial scene is the most extreme example.) there are some other significant difficulties. jeremy irons, a fine actor, plays antonio as if he were overdosed on sedatives. joseph fiennes is pretty but shallow as bassanio. most of the actors, with the exceptions of collins, pacino, and the actor playing the duke in the trial scene, mumble their dialogue.final verdict? a pretty film with a few decent performances. it's not shakespeare, it's poor interpretation. not really worth your time or money--although lynn collins as portia almost redeems it.

watching this movie and then listening to the commentary, it's clear that michael radford doesn't understand this play. the first clue that he fails to fully grasp the work is that he takes pains to set the film in seventeenth-century venice. which sounds truly odd, yes, that misunderstanding the film would mean trying to make it as accurate to its location as possible. but anyone who's studied shakespeare knows that, while he set most of his plays in exotic locals, the culture and values are always contemporary england. this doesn't hurt the film, but it displays a lack of necessary knowledge.where radford kills the film is in making it so dead serious. he manages to suck every joke out of the script, leaving the whole production flat. every ounce of passion is beaten out of the characters. even shylock's 'do we not bleed' speech is a mild, awkward ranting from a choleric who seems to only be saying and doing what he does because he's supposed to. the lovers are solemn and far too restrained (joseph fiennes delivers some of the most romantic lines in the cinema this year in a barely audible whisper), gratiano (who has to promise to behave at one point) is more sober and collected than bassiano (who makes him promise to behave), jessica is reluctant to leave her father and spends her life with lorenzo pouting.in the commentary for the bland and watered-down court scene, the director voices his shock that an audience laughed at portia's 'a pound of flesh, no more, no less' sentence; ultimately concluding that it had to tension release laughter. 'the merchant of venice' is a comedy and radford scoffs at the idea that the most absurd and hysterical portions of the story are anything but the most daringly provocative drama.the film has no intelligible focus, yet cuts out some of the most entertaining scenes. the characters are forced into high drama veils, so they come out sounding like ibsen characters reading victorian poetry. and the comedic ending, where all of the good guys go to bed happy, is drowned in a dignified despair that feels like they're finding stiff- upper-lip peace with impending death, rather than reconciling with lovers. even lancelot and antonio exit the film holding their hats like aristocratic mourners.the film is poorly done because the creative powers that be don't understand the script. it is stern where it should hysterical. it is reserved where it should be passionate. it is michael radford where it should be william shakespeare.

this is one of those wonderful martial-arts movies that begin with two posses of tough gang members facing off in a park; and when the deal goes wrong and the battle starts, it turns out they all know karate and kung fu! the ever-wooden cynthia rothrock plays (as usual) a cynical, deadpan, good cop, this time in los angeles. she and her police partners are trying to break up a counterfeiting ring, and when that plot line is exhausted, the story just switches over to something else, and cynthia becomes the personal bodyguard of a wealthy, great-looking tycoon. within the film's obviously rock-bottom budget, there's some helicopter action, some speedboat action, some car chases, a brawl where cynthia beats up everyone in a country-western bar, some swimming-pool scenes with bimbos in thong bikinis, and a surprisingly good horseback chase. about a dozen and a half cops get gunned down. a lot of plot twists happen that just don't make any sense; don't worry about them. (and counterfeiting currency is a federal crime, so where the hell is the fbi? i guess they were too busy.) the fight choreography was done by cynthia rothrock's frequent co-star richard taylor, whose classy and witty presence in front of the camera would frankly have made this a better movie. he also tended to make cynthia a better actress when they appeared together, and frankly she could use it; she seems tired and bored, and does her best acting in guardian angel when she is playing opposite a pet dog to whom she delivers bitter drunken monologues. the dog almost out-acts her! she also wears some of the most god-awful clothing any leading lady has ever worn in any movie: loose, baggy-leg jeans with pale acid-washed areas over each buttock were the most shocking. the other actors are all over the map. you can picture many of the minor characters being cast this way: "hey, me and some other guys i know are going to be in a movie. you wanna be in it too? no, dude, i'm serious!" then there are the slumming professionals: the most fun is lydie denier, the stunning french model and veteran of "red shoe diaries," "baywatch," "melrose place," and of playing many, many other variations on the sexy french bombshell; here she plays a psychopathic killer as if she were in baisez-moi or an "alias" episode and not some direct-to-cable trash like this. there's also the tall, dark and handsome daniel mcvicar, now a regular on "the bold and the beautiful," john o'leary, who has played a dignified old man in dozens of movies and sitcom episodes and does it again here, and aharon ipale, the veteran arab character actor perhaps best known as "pharaoh seti" from the mummy and the mummy returns. for these professionals, guardian angel must be the most laughable entry on their resumes. i gave this movie a better rating than it probably deserves because my daughters, who are enthusiastic martial-arts students, both like to see a woman kicking ass and having the big action scenes for a change. they're still a bit too young to care what a low-quality picture this really was, and just enjoyed cheering cynthia on as she did her swivel-legged, high-kicking, stick-fighting thing. if you like this kind of flick, you could probably enjoy it on that level.

a female ex-cop who was drummed out of the force for recklessness (and who could probably beat chuck norris in a fight) hires herself out as a private bodyguard; her first client is a worthless playboy type. it takes half the movie for her to get kicked off the force in the first place. lots of great fight choreography but the plot is strictly by the numbers, and the acting is as wooden as the dialogue. give this one a miss.

i actually trawled through the entire set of reviews, searching for the ones which gave this film less than 5 stars. they were few and far between. which is utterly baffling! yes, i know it's a disney film and it isn't directed by christopher nolan, but good lord. this is straight-to-the-bargain-bucket nonsense. they should've had done with it and animated the bloody thing.and what's even worse is the fact that imdb won't let me simply finish my rant there, because my review needs to be longer! the "awesome" in-game camera shots are literally taken from tiger woods pga tour golf on the playstation, the story plods like a sulking school boy, the multi-stranded character and plot development cripples an already weak setup, and the grand finale is plain boring.aside from that, it really was the greatest film i've ever seen in my entire life. good, authentic-looking costumes, sets and sports equipment. there, i said it.

i went to see "quitting" with high hopes, because the director's "shower" had impressed me so. despite a few lapses into mawkishness, "shower" ranks high on my list of all-time favorite movies for its penetrating insight into family relationships and its generally superb acting and direction. and i've seen it at least three times now.but "quitting" fell flat, in my estimation. it seemed a pointless exercise and i was quickly so tired of the main character's insufferable personality that i was longing for the movie to end. i admit to falling asleep six or seven times, but it was only for a few seconds at a time, so i think it's still ok to write this comment.i did admire the parents and sister. the device of using all real characters in the film is a nice one i've never seen used before.disappointment aside, i will still make an effort to see any film bearing yang zhang's name, simply on the basis of the beautiful "shower."

"cover girl" is a lacklustre wwii musical with absolutely nothing memorable about it, save for its signature song, "long ago and far away." this film came out before gene kelly really hit his artistic stride, and while there are evidences of his burgeoning talent here, mostly he plays sidekick to rita hayworth. and there's the problem. rita hayworth is gorgeous, no doubt about that. but she's simply not a compelling screen presence. i've always found myself wanting to like her more than i actually do, and this movie is no exception. she's simply not a very good actress, and she's not even a very good dancer. good looking as she is, there's something vapid about her, and this movie suffers because of it.grade: c-

i didn't expect a lot when i went out to see this, but my god what a disappointment. the original was kind of fun within it's genre, but this is so bad, i felt abused when i left the theater. there's no plot, it's not funny, it's not enjoyable to watch, it's straight out embarrassing. after an hour i hoped my patience would be rewarded but now i regret not leaving the theater. do yourself a favor and ignore this one, see it when it comes to the small screen. or see it on budget dvd, whatever you do don't waste any money on it. don't say i didn't warn you.

amnesiac women who remove their clothes at the drop of a hat (or a blouse?) are about the only stand-out points in a film that is otherwise slow and aimless. although the basic premise of the story offers a wealth of possibilities, they are never developed to any satisfying degree, and exposition is almost non-existent. a large proportion of the film is mere wanderings through the corridors of a multi-storied clinic/hospital. the overall effect is bleak and sterile, a la thx-1138.

so far i disliked every single jean rollin movie i've seen, and that always bothered me because he's an acclaimed euro-trash monument and extremely popular amongst many regular reviewers on this lovely website; people whose opinions i always value and usually concur with. apparently everybody always appears to pinpoint some sort of gloomy and stylistic filming trademarks in his work that are completely lost on me. rollin's movies are unimaginably boring, they all feature the same basic concept (lesbian vampires in various settings), the dialogs are incredibly absurd, the marvelous gothic setting are always underused and the production values are cheaper than the price of a bus ticket. i had actually given up on rollin's repertoire already (especially after enduring "the iron rose"), until i found out about "night of the hunted". allegedly, this movie doesn't feature any lame lesbian vampires and stands as a bona fide horror movie with gruesome killings and macabre plot twists. and the verdict is  yes and no! on one hand, this is undeniably the most compelling and inventive rollin film i had the pleasure of seeing thus far (and also the only one that i watching without dozing off). on the other hand, it still remains a moronic movie with a nonsensical plot and emotionless sex sequences to compensate for the dullness. jean rollin heavily attempts to generate an atmosphere of secrecy and suspense, mostly through a lack of information and vaguely introduced characters, but barely manages to hide the fact he actually hasn't got a story to tell at all. the unearthly beautiful lead actress brigitte lahaie and the beautifully ominous musical guidance are the only elements that keep you hooked on the screen. during a nightly drive back home to paris, a young man abruptly has to stop for a confused and scarcely dressed girl who comes running from the woods. her name is elisabeth but furthermore she can't remember anything about herself and from what or whom she was running away. her case of amnesia is so bad she even continuously forgets who picked her up. the next day, she's kidnapped again by an old guy and taken to a sinister apartment complex where multiple people in the same bizarre mental state are held captive. elisabeth knows nothing, but she does sense she needs to escape from here. obviously i won't reveal the denouement, but i can assure you it is quite dumb, illogical and far-fetched. apparently rollin realized this as well, because the explanation is kept very brief and quick. there's a large number of overly weird and senseless sequences, the sex footage is dire and filmed without passion, the nasty make-up effects look cheap and randomly thrown without actual purpose. as said, the score is mesmerizing and brigitte lahaie's perfect body is addictive to glaze at.

as a fan of the old series i must say that this is at best a parody of a much beloved series. first the old series would at least attempt to follow some military structure. i know in this p.c. world it is not the thing to do but hey don't turn it into the care bears. in the old series beachead was a hardspoken soldier, now he is a teenage mutant turtle. another thing is the flying tank, ok it flies out of the cobra base and bounces off the copter and they are both ok???? lets face it if the next one is not better this could spell the end of g.i.joe.

as a cartoon, the spytroops movie was pretty bad. it is only 44 minutes long, yet several battles occur culminating with the destruction of the cobra headquarters. one downer was the very beginning of the movie. an animated battle that was better than the rest of the movie turns out to have been some kind of battle simulation. that right there was a major turn-off and made the rest of the movie lack credibility. then there was the issue of shipwreck tied up along with his parrot, and tossed into some room where nobody had checked for several days. whatever happened to surveillance cameras?the cobra base only had a handful of characters, and the rest were bat robots. aside from a lot of corridors the cobra base did not seem to have any weapons, tanks, trucks, or any other equipment. then there was the silly notion that 100 complex androids could be created overnight. the plot was silly even if this was intended for small children. spongebob, powerpuff girls, and even barney the dinosaur give more attention to their plots.the characters were not bad, except that i could never understand anything destro was saying, and the cobra commander was silly and not much of a villain. in fact, except for storm shadow and xartan, the rest of the cobra characters were comical and hardly impressive. the gi joe characters were pretty good. scarlett, agent faces, road block and snake eyes were my favorites here. shipwreck and beach head were the worst. shipwreck is written as a goof-ball and beach head sounded like some 1990s surfer dude. i guess the writer, larry hama was trying to make a character that appealed to teenagers, but he was a decade off the mark. just listening to beach head's spicoli surfer-talk (fast times at ridgemont high) i was wondering if the new gi joes were going to smoke a dube before the big mission.the cgi was pretty good, except that cobra commander had a jerking spastic walk, and the vehicles did not look very realistic at all. the flying tank and the explosions were not very impressive. old style animation would have been much better than this. since hasbro reportedly likes to do things cheap, they got what they paid for. i had trouble watching the whole thing, it was just boring and lacked any soul or gi joe spirit. even the old gi joe commercials would have been better. in fact, the dvd included extras such as four or five current commercials for gi joe spy troops, and those commercials were much more entertaining than the movie. the commercials had more kid-oriented fun and spirit. the commercials were lively, while the movie was dull.

although this movie is inaccurate overall, there are some items that may be true. certainly, he was a wild character in his youth, having played practical jokes on his fellow cadets at west point, almost expelled several times, graduating last in his class (of 34), and often reckless in his leadership during the civil war.but history may have made him a scape goat of the indian wars. certainly, he did his share of cruel things, but how much was he under orders? also, there is evidence that he testified before congress (at great risk to his commission and command) that he argued about the fairness of breaking treaties with the indians and that if he was an indian he would also fight rather than live on a reservation! as a character said in the play 1776 when asked what will be said about the british about losing the revolutionary war, the character states "history will do what it always does...it will lie." who knows how bad a man custer was. certainly he wasn't the sympathetic character as portrayed by errol flynn and later by ronald reagan. but i also doubt he was completely evil as he is later portrayed.

i like errol flynn; i like biographies and i like action movies. this featured all three of these....but i didn't like this film. it just went on too long although the last 20 minutes was excellent, especially in the photography with some great low- angle shots. however, i seemed like it took six hour to get to that point, and i really can't say why i feel this way. the action is interesting, errol flynn and olivia de havilland are fine. in fact, it was refreshing to see de havilland actually be supportive of flynn instead of her normal role as antagonist to him. yet something is lacking in this movie.the film has been roundly criticized for its historical inaccuracy but i don't hear that same criticism for a lot of other films which have done the same. in fact, its rare when a film is historically accurate. for some reason, this revisionist history offended most critics. if the film had made general custer a lot worse than he really was, they would have probably liked it. well, too bad. in their twisted way, critics prefer villains to heroes. i really wish i could have enjoyed this more but i'll take a lot of other flynn adventures over this one.

the first time i watched this movie i was ten years old. i thought it was bad then, and at that age i had no cinematic taste whatsoever. i watched this movie on cinemax about 3 days ago and was reminded why i hated the movie in the first place. madonna's character, nikki, is annoying and obnoxious. there's no way that the main character would ever fall in love with her. the jokes were corny and the dialogue was worse than a t.v. soap opera!! i'm glad that i didn't see this movie at the theatre, or rent it. i feel bad for my parents who had to endure watching it with me! madonna is not necessarily a bad actress, but in this role she is portrayed as a complete idiot.

the laughs are few and far between in this dull movie, and i can't help but wonder about how this mess ever got made in the first place. about the only good thing in this movie is the talent of griffin dunne, but his best efforts were easily overshadowed by madonna's obnoxious performance. i was able to sit through this without getting too bored, but that's probably the nicest thing i can say about this time-waster.

the people who bash this movie were looking for it to be as cool and slick as the first one, which this isn't. this movie was supposed to be the complete opposite as ocean's 11. this has been said by a lot of the cast members and also the director, steven soderbergh. ocean's 12, while it did lack a gripping plot, is being bashed because it was different then what people wanted. if it were released before ocean's 11, it would be taken much differently, not as a failed sequel. the problem with sequels is people go into it with a preset idea of what it should be like it and have lots of expectations. they should go into this movie with an open mind and not expect it to be "ocean's 11, again".

just like most people, i couldn't wait to see this ocean's 11 sequel but it really stinks, i must say. it stinks because there's simply no good screenplay,it was just cheap. i hope the producers donate all the money this movie has made (or will make) to the tsunami-victims in asia so this movie will have at least one good reason to exist. it is so bad i even can't write a decent comment about it but....i still advise the creators of this thing to make "ocean's 13". ocean's 13 will be about the same thieves who are trying to steal a screenplay well hidden somewhere in hollywood. the 13th member will be a foreign (maybe,russian) screenplay-writer who knows all tricks to write a copy of this well hidden screenplay, so they can replace the original they'll have to steal. or they need to find at least 13 people to write a decent screenplay for a movie in which not only julia roberts plays herself but even all other star-members of the ocean's-films. 13 people because it's the lucky number of andy garcia's character.

i've seen "professional" reviews claiming julia roberts playing herself was "clever and very funny". i think not. an actress playing herself? and doing it with her same usual dizziness whenever she tries comedy? talk about hollyweird narcissism at it's utmost. why doesn't she just stand there and go, "me, me, me. look at me!." the director and writer should be shot for not thinking of something better then this in what could have been a charming sequel. and by the way steven, when the audience starts paying more attention to the weird camera angles then the story you have a problem. capra, hitchcock, all used some creative cameras but they were talented enough not to lose the audience in them or just show off with the camera. you seem to have forgotten a cardinal rule of film-making in the name of "style". the pitt and zeta jones chemistry is quite good however, perhaps if they had made the film more focused around them and dispensed with the narcissism it might have worked. once again zeta jones shows how she's got more talent and beauty then roberts could dream of. sadly, this film wastes talent and fails on many accounts. i want my money back.

i hadn't planned on watching o12 because i didn't like o11 that much. i thought o11 was a nice but slightly boring little bank robbers movie with a sensational arsenal of stars. anyway i was talked into watching o12 one night and i regretted it a lot. the plot is not only boring but also senseless. i honestly don't even know what it was all about. i left the movie after 3 quarters and got some coffee with another girl who didn't like it. much more pleasure i can tell you that. but even the guys who stayed till the end later reported to me that the plot continued being awful and useless. my advice: don't watch. go watch team america (hilarious btw;-)) and forget about ocean's twelve.in my opinion the most boring and senseless peace of crap to be on the screen in years.

what a ridiculous waste of time and money!!!! this movie was the biggest loser of the year. all the hype was a warning. i am disappointed for julia roberts, by far she is the most talented cast member. i think her ability to truly act carried the film. the buddy buddy boys club was a little too phony, and to add insult to injury why bother to cast catherine zeta jones? she only has the ability to ruin a film. she lacks the ability to have on screen chemistry with anyone, not to mention she lacks the ability to act. she lacks chemistry with the other characters: kind of reminiscent of "america's sweetheart's". she made "the terminal" terminal. this movie is headed nowhere, what a shame, please please don't tell me "13" is on the way!

rita hayworth plays a brooklyn nightclub dancer named rusty who specializes in cheesecake chorus revues; she manages to get herself on the cover of a national fashion magazine, but her impending success as a solo (with romantic offers all around) has smitten boss gene kelly chomping at the bit. terribly tired piece of technicolor cotton candy, with unmemorable musical sketches (the two worst of which are irrelevant flashbacks to the 1890s, with hayworth portraying her own grandmother). kelly, as always, dances well but acts with false sincerity; when he's serious, he's insufferable, and the rest of the time he's flying on adrenaline. the script is a lead weight, not even giving supporting players phil silvers and eve arden any good lines. *1/2 from ****

rented the video with a lot of expectations, but it was a disappointment. the story didn't make sense, the plot was very weak and the special effects.. well, i think even i can do better with my home computer. sorry. missed a change here.

... brian? what the hell were you *on* when you signed to do this?i saw this recently at a festival, and it was greeted by howling laughter throughout. by the time the credits rolled, tears were streaming down the faces of many of the audience. the plot is a clunky melding of 'e.r.' and 'the x-files'; as cynically aimed at the tv audience as is possible to get without being sued. the sequences involving the abductions are hilarious- both yuzna's staging of the 'floating from the bed' and 'screaming mad george's pathetic plastic aliens drew gales of disbelieving, derisive laughter. limp, camp and stupid. my only hope is that it was an aberration- as awful as 'return of the living dead 3' was good.steev

like 'singin' in the rain', 'cover girl' has a trio of two guys and a girl. in 'cover girl', phil silvers (genius) is the comic relief. he corresponds to donald o'connor's funny man part in 'singin in the rain'. in cover girl, gene kelly's love interest is rita hayworth and in 'rain', it's debbie reynolds. that's where the comparison ends.whereas "singin' in the rain' is a classic american movie musical, 'cover girl' is mediocrity incarnate. the story isn't very complicated. rusty parker (rita hayworth) is a dancer in danny macguire's low-rent nightclub in brooklyn. rusty decides to enter a cover girl contest sponsored by a wealthy publisher, john coudair, who made an unsuccessful play for rusty's grandmother years ago. coudair introduces rusty to broadway producer noel wheaton who makes her into a star. danny feels slighted when rusty starts showing up late for rehearsals at the nightclub and decides to close the club down and go on the road entertaining the troops along with his sidekick, genius. at the last minute, with rusty at the altar with noel, she realizes the error of her ways and runs back to danny. they live happily ever after.gene kelly has the least developed part in the movie. all we find out about him is that he owns a nightclub and is madly in love with rusty. coudair and wheaton act like besotted teenagers toward rusty and phil silvers delivers some thoroughly goofy but unfunny shtick. the most interesting aspect of rita hayworth's performance is the scene in which she gets drunk. this foreshadows what happened to her in real life. anyone who has read her biography will learn that she disliked hollywood, pined away for a normal home life which she could never attain but eventually began drinking and ended up with full-blown alzheimer's during the last years of her life.almost all of the songs in cover girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful. gene kelly has only one really excellent dance number and that's the scene where he dances with his 'alter ego'. earlier, the trio has another number which is a pale precursor of 'make em laugh' from 'singin' in the rain'.the most annoying thing about 'cover girl' is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal. a couple of decades later, raquel welch had the same problem. both actresses later in their careers would always try and find scripts that showcased their acting abilities. they wanted to be known as 'actresses' and not 'pinup girls'. unfortunately, 'cover girl' is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain.

rita hayworth is just stunning at times and, for me, the only reason to watch this silly film. despite the overdone 1940s lipstick, rita was one of the all-time glamor women of hollywood. in fact, for a couple of years i can't imagine anyone that looked better, except maybe elizabeth taylor in her prime.anyway, the co-star of the show, gene kelly, does not play his normal likable, at least the kind of guy we all know him from in "singin' in the rain." here, kelly's "danny mcguire" pouts much of the time. phil silvers, who i loved on tv at "sgt. bilko," is so stupid in here as "genius" you will just cringe listening to his dumb jokes....and they are stupid.the visuals are good with great technicolor, which almost looks terrific. you get to see a lot of pretty women in here, too, not just hayworth. unfortunately, the story isn't all that much. it centers around hayworth deciding about a career choice. along the way, we get the normal shabby treatment of marriage and we get an insultingly-dumb ending. all in all, an unmemorable film, except as a showcase for hayworth's beauty.

this is just what we need, a show about the people nobody likes in high school or in university. man or woman. people objectifying others and congratulating themselves for doing so is exactly the opposite of intelligent thinking. and this show is just disgusting for doing exactly that.so four men sit in chairs and watch two other guys try and pick up women to have sex with them. and in the end one of the two wins, great...just f-n great. i'm also supposed to accept these four douche bags as being "judges" of people's "game". the term "game" has got to be the most moronic thing to come out of modern english since the term "bling bling", added to the fact that these men are called the "experts" just makes me want to throw up whats left of my respect for modern culture. these are not god damn role models, they are the result of mtv culture coming to bite us in the ass. if you enjoy the bullshit spilling out the sides of this monstrosity then you probably think paris hilton and britany spears have talent. its not true and you should be ashamed of yourself for thinking so.and for all those people who will say that i would like this better if i got laid, or that i'm just jealous. go screw yourself, because its obvious that a real girl certainly won't.

game.... huh... game. i'm not even sure the bloody hosts of that particular reality-game know what the term 'game' means, let alone the bloody players in the game! an aspiring pua would look at that and think... hmmmmm... what the flying fork was that useless excuse for a demonstration of seducing women? i've seen my neighbours dog seduce women with more panache than that! and it is one ugly bloody dog! and its main approach tactic is to frenetically hump legs! i challenge the frustrated chump hosts of that show to a show-down; a demonstration of their so-called pickup ability... can they deliver? if one is to view that piece of un-reality-drivel, then you would realise, no, these grandstanding, mentally-masturbating, suck-me-darling-boyfriend, wanna be hosts of queer eye or something similar (not that there's anything wrong with that...), are unable to un-shrinkwrap their penises long enough to provide a demo of a real pickup. as you lovely north-americans say: "...'nuff said!..." a message from down under... with love....

4 realz son my game iz mad tite yo i cant wait 2 get on dis show and roll up in da club n do it real 905 style wit mad models n bottles, son!no, i'm just kidding. this is a sad show, created by, and for the enjoyment of, sad men. men who are so neutered by modern existence that they channel their frustration into the clubs, where they eke out fleeting self-validation preying on chicks in hopes of getting their little wieners touched to try and dull the sting of loneliness and make them feel, even if just for one night, as though their seat on the board of the sausage party of toronto is a little less permanent. i read some comments on here saying that this show represents canadian tv's finally stepping up to stand on a par with american tv or somethingorother. well, that's not aiming short at all. it's like, yes! pat yourself on the back, canada -- you've finally cracked the elusive formula for such groundbreaking american content as "studs", "change of heart", "elimidate" and "the fifth wheel". see, the real brainchild here is tacking "...meets candid camera" onto the pitch. genius. and there's nothing that straddles that thin line between fratboy camaraderie and latent homosexuality like a group of grown men taping each other on hidden camera, admiring each other's "game" up in the club. the man-love on display here is so palpable they should really consider rechristening it "keys to the steam bath".on a side note, how interesting that the folks who gave this show such glowing reviews seem to have registered an imdb account for the express purpose of doing so (i guess i'm guilty of employing the same means to do the opposite here.) my personal favorite is the one enthusiastic reviewer that claims to hail from the "united states" who gushes that "now it's clear that the talent in canada has the ability to produce american quality television." smooth. but why even bother manufacturing online buzz? you can't really get cancelled, after all -- you're on the comedy network in canada, baby! the viewing public will go on ignoring your show for years to come. in all likelihood you'll be just fine, coasting comfortably along that proverbial plain of mediocrity with the majority of the comedy network's original programming.

there were two things i hated about wasted : the directing and the script . i know i`m opening myself up to ridicule but stephen t kay`s direction is too much like a .... like a .... well like a mtv pop video . it`s shot ( i think ) on digital video against an intrusive soundtrack , often out of focus and often with rapid cross cutting . if you`re not a teenager you`ll find many segments of wasted unwatchable due to the stylistic approach . as bad as the directing was it was the script that yanked my chain . the story is told through samantha , a poor little rich girl who spends much of the film talking through voice over ( strange how the voice over never seems idiosyncratic enough to have come from the same character ) telling us of the pressure of her exams , the pressure of home life , her social solitude and it`s all this that led her to take drugs . it`s for similar reasons like parental break up that her two male friends ( i thought she was supposed to be lonely ? ) to start taking drugs . oh poor little sammi in her nice house and her problems how my heart bled for you and your chums - not . what wasted doesn`t mention is that no matter what someone is addicted to , be it drink , drugs , nicotine or chocolate that person has to work at becoming an addict , they`re not a victim of external forces , they`re commiting an act of free will . both traffic and trainspotting made this point very well , people become addicts because they want to . to portray them as victims in any way is wrong patronising and very possibly dangerousby the way , if mtv are anti drugs will they stop playing videos from stars who freely admit taking drugs ?

wasted is just that, a waste of time. mtv is churning out made for tv movies at quite a clip nowadays. a friend of mine recommended this and i rented it, needless to say i will not be pursuing anymore recomendations from her anytime soon. this movie shows the rollercoaster of drug use. the problem is, you really don't care about any of the characters due to lack of believabilty and their own self discipline. this movie is in a word, annoying to watch, from the terrible camera angles to the quality of dialogue and pacing. the 'digital' format tries for realism, but comes up distracting. if you want a true scope on drug use watch requiem for a dream.

good lord.i'm going to say right off the bat, i only watched 20 minutes of this movie. as i am a hardcore eraserhead fan, the "what, you can't watch a wierd black and white movie with little-to-no dialogue?" defense does not apply. i simply can't watch terrible weird black and white movies with little-to-no dialogue.this movie is what happens when you give an angsty goth-child with no talent and nothing to say a camera and budget, and let him/her put as much meaninglessly offensive imagery on screen as possible. it was clear from the start that this film should have been 5 minutes long (assuming it should exist at all). shots that should last a few seconds drag on for minutes, because the director has "i-just-love-the-sound-of-my-own-voice" syndrome, and refuses to cut to another shot until the entire piece of footage has been viewed. from the moment the girl in the mask started masturbating the corpse of "god" (the opening scene of the film! joy!), i knew it was only a matter of time until i turned off the tape. after at least 10 minutes of a different corpse being pulled around, twitching, on a rope, by a gang of cloaked mystery-men, i knew it was time to give up. rarely do i give up on a movie. i sat through the entirety of blair witch 2: book of shadows, albeit not happily. this did not deserve the 20 minutes i gave it.if you're an eraserhead fan, do not let simple-minded comparisons to said film con you into renting this piece of amateur trash. allow me to refer you to tetsuo: the iron man, for a watchable and enjoyable piece of incoherent black and white weirdness.

directed by e. elias merhige "begotten" is an experiment with a few interesting ideas that don't quite succeed in what they were trying to do. the film is a 76 minute ultra slow, questionably effective, irritating experience that tries to present an intriguing philosophy about the creation of the earth and human nature.it opens with god presented as a chair-bound psychopathic man who tears open his stomach using a knife. from the guts, blood and human waste mother nature emerges. she proceeds to impregnate herself with the dead god's semen. later she gives birth to the son of the earth. a retard who is constantly abused a group of cannibalistic people whom i believe to be the representation of mankind."begotten" takes a twisted and disturbing look on the origin of life. demonstrating the self-destructive nature, violence, lust and greed that have become a trademark for mankind. the problem in the movie come from two points. one is that the film is just too slow in it's exhibition. what we get is a good thirty minutes spent on showing how the son of the earth is constantly shaking naked on the ground while at the same time being molested and tortured by mankind. such tasteless prolonging gets boring pretty fast and lacks the punch in delivering a blow to the viewer's senses.another point is "beggoten's" visual appearance and sound. the grainy, inverted, black and white low frame cinematography enchants the disturbing factor of the plot, but such novelties often work in only short periods of time. then gradually begin to lose their effect as the audience becomes accustomed to the look. the audio suffers from the same problems. it's constant repetitive and similar sounds become annoying so fast i had an urge to turn off the volume. "begotten" loses it's charm shortly after it begins. it tries to be original and creative but it fails to expand on the ideas hinted by the vague plot instead it repeats the same scene again and again.the conclusion is that "begotten" is stuck in one moment. even though plot-wise it tries to move forward, the visuals and audio remain the same throughout. showing the same action in a slightly different way with just slightly a different sound. a gimmick cannot alone make a movie. it also needs pace and variety, something merhige seems to have forgotten.

begotten is, no doubt, someone's attempt at originality, but, what we have here is art in its most morbid, grotesque form, so, for that, begotten has my respect, but, to be realistic, it makes no difference what this abomination is about, but for the record...in the ultimate in incoherent horror, we begin in an unknown time, in an unknown place. right off the bat, we are plunged into the psychotic nightmare that is begotten, a god is, seemingly depressed, mutilating himself with a razor, i mean, really trying like hell to end it all, it takes a while (why wouldn't it?) after this ultra-morbid introduction, something is happening, something is rising from the corpse, say hello to mother earth. what does she do? well, she gives birth to a thing. the thing would have probably preferred to stay in the womb, but that's life. the psychotic nightmare realm of begotten welcomes the thing the only way it knows how. the thing, along with mother earth is mutilated by unknown, hooded, assailants, with evil intentions being the only clarity available. from this point on, things drag as they've never dragged before. interesting, grim images, with a totally decent soundtrack, is the high points of the remainder. not to give the impression that i don't recommend this evilness, because i do, but only once, and only for people with an appreciation for the dark side.from my description, it may appear that i don't "get" begotten. trust me, i get it, and yes, begotten is art if i've ever seen it. everything in this film, regardless of how unrelated it may seem, is significant. that, perhaps, is the only thing that makes begotten art. with that said, most of us require some form of entertainment value, and this is coming from someone who enjoyed the chooper. probably the most intriguing first five minutes, i've seen in a film, but let's be realistic, the next 7 hours and 55 minutes would put one in a coma, that is, unless it's just meant for some kind of psychedelic purposes, in that case, never mind. but, how would one rate such a uniquely boring masterpiece? depending on how much your attention span can take, it should be either 1 or 10, any other number just wouldn't make a statement. it hurts to do this, but as far as entertainment value goes, begotten just ain't it. 1/1

i have watched this movie over and over since it first came out. i was fifteen and even then, i knew it was cheesy. it had such great potential and i constantly rewrite the script in my head. the capoeira ruined what could have been a good drama. i loved the fact that it was shot on location. too bad that the characters were underdeveloped. it's like they wrote a first draft of a script then made the movie right away. at fifteen i could have written a better script!some scenes and dialog seemed to come out of nowhere and you were left with a lot of unanswered questions. and was it just me, or did it seem like lobo was sexually attracted to his cousin? "elena's grown into some kind of woman!" and the way he was always touching her. would have an interesting plot twist, elena working for her drug dealing cousin who is also a perv. too bad they missed the mark on this one.

anyone remember the docudrama threads ? it's a drama documentary which shocked britain in september 1984 . whilst not exactly wholly entertained by mick jackson's nuclear holocaust horror film i could respect it . unfortunately i can't respect this docudrama broadcast 20 years later which deals with terrorists letting off a radioactive dirty bomb in the centre of london the problem i have with it is that director daniel percival production values are far too good when in fact this would have benefited from rather cheap production values . the cinematography is superb but in this type of speculative drama do we need superb and well lit oscar standard cinematography ? what we certainly don't need is a musical score as the survivors of the blast slowly stagger out of the smoke . neither do we need vaguely well known cast members . did anyone else sit there asking themselves " hey what was he in ? i know that face " several times ? i know i did and it's very distracting . perhaps the biggest production flaw with dirty war is that someone decided to make it a docudrama with too much stylistic emphasis on the drama . in threads the action cuts away from the action in sheffield umpteen times and becomes an edition of horizon on the effects of nuclear war before cutting back to the fictional protagonists again and threads is very effective because of this . here the information presented suffocates the drama which drowns in expositional and totally unconvincing dialogue . the characters in the teleplay aren't really characters they're just cyphers there to inform the audience what happens when radioactive material is exploded . it would have been better for the action to cut to captions to convey this type of information ala threads . the worse thing is that director daniel percival used the same technique as seen in threads a couple of years ago with his docudrama about smallpox . he should have used the same style with dirty wari should also lay my cards on the table and state that while i don't consider most muslims are terrorists i am getting slightly fed up of tv productions like the hamburg cell , the grid and dirty war having to point out this fact to me by whalloping me over the head with it which is somewhat typical of patronising pc attitudes in tv companies nowadaysi managed to miss the studio debate that bob mentions here but i have also heard it discussed elsewhere and i can't help thinking it makes better viewing than dirty war itself with its heated arguments between differing factions of the political spectrum . if dirty war is remembered twenty years from now ( highly unlikely i know ) it may well be remembered for the discussion it caused more than anything

highly suggest not to watch this film 'tv' if not mentally mature enough , the film create quite realistic simulation with the steps how they prevent from terrorism if such touch wood incident happened , london suppose a lovely and chill ful city , while these kind of wars still going on , just wasting the time and money for study and living, every time passing around p square, the feeling really obvious, uncomfortable actually , i don't want to vote , the scored means nothing , just 4 'fill in the blank' only safty and positive thinking cities encourage better economy and investors to keep investing time,energies and money

dirty war aspect ratio: 1.78:1sound format: stereoemergency services struggle to cope when islamic terrorists detonate a so-called 'dirty bomb' in the middle of london.daniel percival's frightening movie uses all available evidence to dramatize the possible effects of a radioactive explosion in the heart of the uk capital, using the kind of documentary-style realism which has distinguished this particular subgenre since the 1960's. in essence, the film reveals a catalogue of flaws in the british government's current strategy for dealing with such terrorist outrages, and percival's carefully-honed script (co-written by lizzie mickery) vents its spleen against mealy-mouthed politicians who would rather maintain the economic status quo than tackle this issue head-on. the film covers all necessary bases, and makes the salient point that this kind of terrorism is practised by a tiny handful of fanatics who have tarnished the islamic faith with their reckless disregard for human life, though viewers won't be reassured by the subsequent scenes of devastation and horror. not merely a drama, the film acts as a warning against complacency. either that, or its just another post-9/11 scaremongering tactic. you be the judge...

words almost fail me to describe how terrible this irish vanity project (funded by canadian taxpayers - both federal and albertan) really is.there's a sudden appearance by a nice looking canadian woman (kathy ranheim) who in real life was a star athlete in alberta, for no other reason to ensure canadian content. credits also indicate that certain calgary pubs were of assistance.everything here is poorly filmed and at least third-hand (chunks of poorly digested trainspotting, lock stock, snatch and reservoir dogs are the most obvious steals). avoid like the plague unless you fancy one of those campy "so bad it's almost funny" nights in front of your telly.

the film moves along quite well but the acting, direction and editing leave a lot to be desired. the characters are mostly lifted from other films and the vinnie jones lookalike is straight out of gone in 50 seconds. the comedy gangster movie is a genre that should have lots of contrast, the stupid dealers in lock stock and the shoot out that leaves everyone dead. you should never really know whether to laugh or just sit there in shock. this movie had the right elements but it is too easy to sit there like a person knitting and tut at the small details that should have been fixed somewhere along the line and once belief has been unsuspended one just become increasingly critical. a pity cos it was a brave attempt and although clint eastwood is famous for saying that'll be ok for a scene, he puts the work in before he shoots and he is clint eastwood. here a bit more imagination with the camera and and a bit more coaching and rehearsal for the delivery of the lines would have made a big difference.

i've sat through less painful operations than the time i spent watching this film. if you give it a try thinking it's going to be something in the vein of a guy ritchie flick.....think again! the production, dialogue, acting, script , film work and plot were about the worst i've ever seen in a film. my fave part in all honesty was the closing credits. in all the history of cinema has there never been a better excuse for turning off the tv and going out and doing something better with your life.have root canal work done rather than wasting your time and money on this!

it hurt to watch this movie, it really did... i wanted to like it, even going in. shot obviously for very little cash, i looked past and told myself to appreciate the inspiration. unfortunately, although i did appreciate the film on that level, the acting and editing was terrible, and the last 25-30 minutes were severe thumb-twiddling territory. a 95 minute film should not drag. the ratings for this one are good so far, but i fear that the friends and family might have had a say in that one. what was with those transitions? dear mr. editor, did you just purchase your first copy of adobe premiere and make it your main goal to use all the goofy transitions that come with that silly program? anyway... some better actors, a little more passion, and some more appealing editing and this makes a decent movie.

it's been said that some directors make small budget pictures look like blockbusters. albert pyun makes small budget pictures look like high school a/v project films. this film was pretty much lacking in all departments. practically every scene drags on excessively, the "experimental" lighting and camera work is terrible, rob lowe apparently equated being scruffy with acting, and the poor drab euro-pop numbers stop the movie to a dead halt. on the plus side, burt reynolds does a pretty good job with what he's given (which isn't much), mario van peebles is surprisingly decent and ice-t puts in another of a long recent string of b-movie gangsters. not pyun's worst work (urban menace), but certainly not his best (mean guns).

do not watch this movie, or.. if you are really mad at anyone, you can give this as a birthdaypresent. this is the worst movies i have ever seen. do not watch this. if you do, remember: that would be a self-destructive action. it is a shame that this is not voted lower.

i saw this movie a time ago, because some of my friends wanted to rent it, and i got voted down.. i tried as best i could to get the story, because some moviemag had said that this would be a movie that would be for rob lowe, that pulp fiction had been for john travolta... well.. we can all see that he not only failed, but he fell aaall the way down. this is actually the worst film i've ever seen, and i've seen a great deal of bad movies.. it's just not even worth seeing for free on tv.

crazy six is torture, it must be albert pyun´s worst film. even blast and ticker are better! i can´t believe how boring this film is! how this even got greenlighted? i saw this movie about 3 years ago and the only thing i remember is how bad it was. this isn´t good bad movie, it is simply bad, bad, bad, bad, bad movie.1 out of 10 (½ out of *****)

the worst movie i have ever seen i didn't even watch it all i just fast forwarded it to burt's bits and then the end!!! he is the only reason to watch this!! i have to admit to owning a copy as i am a huge burt fan (stop laughing) and needed it for my collection i wouldn't care when this movie came out i had a nightmare renting ti as my local store only had 2 copies and fans of all the various stars always beat me there, imagine my disappointment when i sat down and watched this movie!! there are just no redeeming qualities about this movie!!! absolutely nothing what so ever to like about this movie!!! this movie became a running joke between myself and a mate burt's worst!! rob lowe's worst worst hour and a half of my life

i'm actually too drained to write this review -- bad movies always do that to me -- but i feel obligated, as if it's my civic duty, to warn anyone who might be considering purchasing or viewing this god-awful mess-of-a-picture. please, please, just take my word: this is one you'll want to stay away from. it's so boring and dull, so insipid and uninspired, such a poor excuse to assemble any familiar talent. burt reynolds? wasted (despite his best efforts). ice-t is barely in the film, and when he does appear on screen his performance is so restrained and muted that it becomes crystal clear that the director, perhaps intimidated by ice's intense stare, didn't know what to do with him. rob lowe, as the title character, has never displayed so little on-screen charisma. mario van peebles should be ashamed of himself; his performance is, in the saddest sense possible, a joke. surely, satan himself signed mario's check for this film. the plot is as weak, half-baked and annoying as all the music involved (the utterly boring club song seems to continue on, literally, for the first third of the movie). the film's look will prompt one to seriously wonder if the director of photography was also forced, like one of the film's forgettable female characters, to smoke crack from a pipe duct-taped to his mouth. and if you're looking, at least, for stylized, shoot-'em-up-type violence you'll get none here. this film, i assure you, i promise you, has absolutely no redeeming qualities! please, i implore you, avoid this flick! don't put it in and get suckered into believing that its pace will pick up, it'll get better, and evolve into a decent denouement. it won't. it don't. it can't! it sucks! now, you have been warned, and i can now go to bed (it's 3am - please forgive any resulting errors this admonition might contain) -- knowing my conscience is clear, because i've done my civic duty for my fellow man!

yeah, that's right. if i were to ask my friends this question: "what's the worst movie you have ever seen?" they might reply something like "armageddon" (can you drill the hole?!?), "shriek", "plan nine from outer space", "the medallion", "scooby doo" etc... no - don't get offended by this by thinking you have seen something that might be in the same department of naturally produced human fertilizer that this movie is in. if the worst movie you can think of is, let's say so bad it really pisses you off; then you know nothing my friend.crazy six... i remember the day me and a buddy of mine went to the local video store to rent a movie. both of us had already been through most of the movies in there, and on the "new movies"-shelf we see it staring at us. "wow, there's some good actors here man. says something about mafia, lets just get it and get out of here". this was without doubt the worst movie mistake in my movie loving life. it was also the worst mistake for everybody else: movie lover or not.watching this movie is as fun as watching a glass of ice cold water (or ice-tea....) until it reaches room temperature. watching this movie will make you dream an eternal dream of death, if death is just blackout light and nothing, and then you realize you are just staring at your tv-monitor. not staring. you are actually paying as much attention that is humanly possible. this is no joke.this movie is the perfection of making a bad movie. it's not the kind of bad you can watch, point and laugh of, its the kind of movie that is so bad you actually have no chance of ever get out of your memory. unless perhaps you use electric shock therapy to clear out the brain. .... ... (hey! that might be something similar to how i remember me and my buddy felt after watching it....)best regards from me to you albert pyun.-joergen

do not rent this movie. i ended up buying the "previously viewed" tape of this for $4.00. that was close to the price of a rental, so thought, i might as well buy it. i'm tossing it out after i finish this review. the movie which stars lowe, is a music video with few lines of dialogue, slow moving shots and poorly done editing. i thought i'd be seeing a mindless action flick, which is what i wanted to see, i didn't even get that. this movie is an exercise in slow moving shots, no script, close-ups, terrible edited, and a poorly developed plot. i can't believe that is actually ends with a scene in which they think the audience cares about the characters. by the end of the movie, we still don't even really know who they are. believe the hype, stay away.

crazy director....yeah, you need to be crazy to make a near movie. rob lowe was bad in his character, ice-t is always bad and burt reynolds had nothing to do in the movie. crazy six is an unknown movie, with some known actors...this is pretty weird. a bad movie with some good actors in it. it looks like the bad movie did an influence to their performance...it did! crazy people.....i give it *and a half out of *****

honestly, i didn't really have high expectations for this movie, but at the same time i was hopeful. having it be directing by albert pyun - one of the more well known b-movie auteur's - didn't exactly raise my hopes. i mean how many albert pyun flicks rank that highly? yeah, exactly ... but still the movie advertised a decent cast. rob lowe, burt reynolds (pre-reborn stardom), ice-t and mario van peebles.it all amounts to squat however as the movie is so boring and moves so slowly that the energy just seemed to drain right out of me the longer it went on. it runs over 90 minutes, but it's telling a story that could have been told in 30 minutes flat. i don't know what pyun was going for here. i mean the movie drips artsy-like style, but it's a blur at times and maybe i'm an idiot for expecting more from pyun this time around. here he seemed to actually have a budget and a potentially great cast for the material, but it's all wasted. crazy six isn't much of an action film, it's not much of anything really.i guess what's the saddest here is the fact that i found the end credits the most entertaining part of the movie. the music score is actually half-decent with some smooth female vocals too, but the rest is a complete waste and the less said the better. avoid.

this is the worst movie ive ever seen. and i have seen lots of movies. me and my friends rented this one a wendsday evening. man we had lots of fun. this movie is the worst most boring crap ive ever seen. but it makes you laugh! u will lay on the floor rolling around tryin to get some air. you wonder why? just rent it and check for the keyboard playing girl at that sleazy russian bar. my mother would make a 1000 times better movie about her feedin the cats.

i bought this movie for about 2,5 dollars at a local flea market. i thought that with the cast present in this movie (ice-t, rob lowe & mario van peebles are all ok), it would be pretty good. boy, was i wrong. this movie annoyed the hell out of me. almost every scene drags on too long. the scene where rob lowe is watching this girl singing and dancing in a bar lasts forever! it was one of the worst scenes i have ever witnessed in a movie. the rest is no picknick either. my guess is when they finished the movie, they only had 30 minutes of film, so they made everything last 3x longer.conclusion: the current 1,9 rating here on imdb is right on the money. this was one of the worst movies i've ever seen. go watch some paint dry for 1,5 hour instead of watching this!if you want to see some better movies made by this director, watch 'mean guns'(with christopher lambert & ice-t) or 'postmortem' (with charlie sheen) instead.

the story overall, though quite graphic, is actually decent and reasonably interesting to readers. however, the movie was absolutely dreadful. the story was good, but the acting was terrible. i was crying the whole time because i knew i could never get my spent time back. don't see this movie. if you do, bring a pistol with a bullet in it, and a few bullets if you're going with friends. i feel sorry for everybody who had anything to do with this film. i also feel sorry for everybody who had to watch the film. avoid this film at all costs, and if your mother forces you to watch, kill her. hahahahaha! see! i'm a psycho now!!!! ikwtcbs turned me into a psycho!!!!

i had to read i know why the caged birds sing in my english class and we watched the movie after finishing it. after watching the movie, i regret seeing. it completely took away any of the impact the book had. the scenes made no sense in their sequences, the acting was horrible, and it seemed as though the screen writer never actually picked up the book but opted for the cliff notes instead. i was outraged at how the movie ended. almost half of the book was cut out and certain aspects were extremely important to maya's growth as a person. if you have read ...caged birds, this movie will ruin the experience of the book so i warn you not to see it.

a ridiculous movie, a terrible editing job, worst screenplay, ridiculous acting, a story that is completely ununderstandable...if god was going to decide if movies should continue to be done, judging by this one, the entire world movie industry would now be dead...a wonderful movie to show that cinema should not be done by people who "think" they can make movies.i am still wondering who are those two gipsy girls who show up in the movie for over half an hour, and are never introduced to us...

you would probably get something like this. i'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence. of course, there are stupid hollywood movies about drunken teenagers on a spring break, but those movies don't even claim to be serious works of art. but when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as "pretentious crap". to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful, i can only say - it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt (it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things) .one more thing: i can tolerate political incorrectness very well, i'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief, but the slavic female character was just too much. i wish someone told the director that it's kind of ridiculous (even in an unrealistic art movie) to portray a slavic woman as a half-articulate dishevelled creature connected to the forces of nature, probably due to the fact that she had spent her entire childhood looking at the stars and milking cows on a three-legged stool.

first, i don't see how the movie is on any "best" list or how it won any awards. compared to la pianiste, which is also on a "best" list, la pianiste is gold. this movie lacked so many things, on so many different levels, but i can't quite explain why i disliked it so much. the lead actor was annoying, i felt as though i never knew what was going on, and i was bored!! even though this was supposed to be some worthwhile life change that pierre was starting, i wanted it to end.... as soon as possible. why did it have to be his sister and cousin? ugh. and why did thibault get mean? he just bipolarly turned mean. and also, was it me or did i miss the whole purpose of what that guy in black was all about? who were all those people playing music in the big basement of the big warehouse? why did they have all that weird equipment and the guns and all those extra rooms for people to live in? i mean this in all seriousness, but does incest happen a lot in french culture? european culture? i took 5 years of learning about the culture and i never heard anything about that!

french cinema sucks! down with all these psychiotric visions with their my-god-am-i-cultivated distinguished attitudes! pestilence to conceited symbolic film-language and impervious chiffres! i'll no longer have a mind for that! léos carax, did you ever think about, that a dialogue in a film could be natural and vivid??? maybe i'm too common to understand you? or had it been your task to confirm all the clichés of a frenchman the world can have? guillaume the to-be-guilliotined comes to his home-palace, mme. deneuve, not in the picture, plays the flute: "here am i, darling!" in this moment, i knew, that she's in the bathtub, and we`ll see her lying in there soon. don't misunderstand me, i'm not prudish, and the incestous sex scene was the climax of the film. but this is, in berlin, we say "etepetete", what means something like "être-peut-être", a snobistic, self-satisfied, and, the worst, seen that often in french movies i can tell! other example: she, beautiful and willing, is looking at herself in a mirror, combing her hair, and her wild-bearded, dirty young guru rushs into the room, breathless shouting: "there's no escape, there's no escape!" forty years after existencialistic sartres and consorts- what's new, what's exciting about? my god, there's that woman and she loves and admires you, what would be more natural to be happy with your life? and when you're not, please explain much better, why!! born french means you have to live a life in extravaganza, no escape, is that the point?

the movie contains a very short scene of deneuve in a bathtub. she looks absolutely stunning for a lady age 56, but this is the only saving grace of the movie. otherwise, it has a mindless, unmotivated script and the lead actress has none of deneuve's appeal. the director apparently watched too many peter greenaway films and pola x comes across as a student's imitation of the greenaway style, without any of his inspiration.

i'm accustomed to being patient with films because i've generally found it usually pays off. but a few works take tedium to new levels and enter the realm of provocation...."last year at marienbad" comes to mind. well, "pola x" ain't no "last year at marienbad". i can count on one hand the number of films i've walked out on over the years. "pola x" achieved membership in that august group. in my defense, i believe i made a valiant effort to stand my ground - hoping things would turn around. however, i finally threw in the towel just shy of the 90 minute mark - quite respectable under the circumstances. "pola x" does not come anywhere near living up to the promise of carax's earlier work. after a 10 year hiatus, that must have been bitter for him indeed. melville is still spinning in his grave!

pretentious claptrap, updating herman melville (!), about a young man's vaguely incestuous relationship with his aristocratic mother getting transferred to his long-lost sister who has been raised by gypsies. or something like that  not that anyone really cares to unravel its multi-layered plot decked out with pornographic sex scenes, pseudo-symbolic imagery (the siblings swimming in a river of blood) and other bizarre touches (a gypsy child repeatedly insults passers-by in the street until she is anonymously beaten to death, the deafening music of a rock group utilized in the demolition of old buildings). considering the source material and the presence of catherine deneuve (who at least gets to bathe in the nude), i was expecting a lot more from this one; apparently, there's an even longer tv version of pola x out there

it's difficult to express how bad this movie is. even in the 1950s when intellectual searching for the meaning of life was fashionable and beatnik rejection of physical comforts, clean clothes, haircuts, etc. was a common reaction to the smug middle-class mores of both the usa and western europe, this movie would have been a stinker. the plot is a mishmash of several dei ex machina (if that's the correct latin grammar); the acting consists of deadpan stares broken by occasional hysterics (by the male lead as well as the females); the gratuitous view of catherine deneuve's (or somebody's) breasts are worthy of a budweiser commercial; the repeated cacaphonous orchestra rehearsal in the abandoned building is i'm sure heavy with meaning in the director's mind but to me is just one more stupid symbol thrown into this meaningless movie -- i'm ranting because my time has been wasted watching this scam excuse for an art flic. the scenery is beautiful and the sex scene is hot -- but underneath his clothes, this king has no substance.

i enjoyed carax's "les amants du pont neuf" and was therefore expecting this film to be of a similar standard. well, the first 10 minutes were ok, but then it disintegrates into a rather pretentious journey of a young man looking for the essence of life. a sad disappointment.

i won't lie, i rented this film because it was an "arty" film with some possible explicit sex. i got that scene and catherine deneuve's (briefly shown) breasts, but the rest of the film is just the usual long pretentious european art films with lines like "did i have a mother or father, i don't know" (paraphrased). usually delivered in long soliloquies.if you are curious about the transition of "art" to porn, might be an interesting look, with use of the fast forward button (i was still too slow!)

(spoilers)oh sure it's based on moby dick. totally obsessed and it destroy's him. it's a total folly. the movie starts off rather well, but by the end of the film, everyone else is destroyed and the main star's mind is a blank.the supposed half sister is never convincing. some very poor lighting effects. music is interesting. but little else. it took me over a month to finally finish the darn thing. i suppose if you like being john malkovich, you might like this. but where as bjm was a great movie that i just didn't want to watch again, pola x is a movie i just hate to high hell. the only possible excitement in the film is the gratuatious incest sexual scene towards the end of the film. (hopefully yer not thinking of catherine either.)this movie is severely boring, depressing, and poorly directed. not highly recommended. if if you like french movies. (go watch crimson rivers instead)4/10quality: 5/10 entertainment: 1/10 replayable: 0/10

this movie is so unreal. french movies like these are just waste of time. why watch this movie? even, i did not know..why. what? the well known sex scene of half-siblings? although the sex scene is so real and explicit, but the story it is based upon is so unreal. what is the use of it, then? can you find easily in life, half sibling doing such things?did i learn something from this movie? yeah: some people are just so fond of wasting time making such movies, such stories, such non-sense. but for those who like nihilism, nothingness in life, or simply a life without hope, then there you are.. you've got to see this movie.only one worth adoring, though: catherine deneuve. she's such a strikingly beautiful woman.

i wish depardieu had been able to finish his book and see it become a dazzling success. at least he'd have wound up with something.the film struck me as pointless, rambling, and very stylish, like some other recent french films. not to knock it. most recent american films are pointless and rambling and have no style whatever. we should be grateful, i suppose, for photography that evokes a european city in the midst of a wind-blown continental winter, and for elliptical conversations that challenge our ability to understand what's up.but there can be too much of a good thing. golubeva is found stumbling around near the sea in the middle of the freezing night, carrying on in a bad accent about dreams and such. (there are a few sequences of dreams that include things like swimming in a river of blood. you'll love it if you're vlad the impaler.) lots of people die. catherine deneuve dies in a suicide by motorcycle. i don't know why. golubeva's young girl dies too, and i don't know why she dies either. she gets slapped in the face, falls to the pavement, and dies.there is supposedly an explicit sex scene too. i'll have to take their word for it because, although it is stylishly photographed, it is stylishly photographed in almost complete darkness. don't worry about the kiddies being shocked. they'll probably be asleep by this time anyway.depardieu isn't a bad actor. as we see him deteriorate from a carefully groomed handsome young man -- well, handsome except that his nose can't seem to get out of his way -- to a limping, murderous, hairy physical wreck, we feel sorry for the guy. golubeva has a wan pretty face, with enormous half-lidded eyes and wide cheeks, like a doll. her next movie should be a remake of lewton's "i walked with a zombie." then there is this mysterious guy who leads a band. i guess it's a band. as far as i could make out, the band is made up of about a dozen drummers and a dozen musicians playing electric guitars. every viewer will find the resultant sound interesting but uncultivated listeners fond of "easy listening" might not enjoy it. if you don't like the music, there's a payoff involved because the sinister composer and leader gets whacked over the head with depardieu's walking stick.i must say, i found it barely worth sitting through. (and it's a longie, too.) at times it was like waiting in your car at a railroad crossing while a long long freight train rumbles slowly by, sometimes stopping entirely. i wish it had had a few jokes.

this film seems well made, and more efforts should be made to promote films by women. that aside, this film is also profoundly disturbing in that it justifies the manipulative and psychotic machinations of a character that is profoundly disturbed. if you've seen any of the promotional material, you might think this is a poignant film about a relationship that's reached its end, but none of that suggests how really disturbing the central premise is:a woman threatens suicide unless her soon to be ex agrees to relive here most treasured memories of their relationship. when told how unfair (to say the least) that such a threat is, tessa (the purported protagonist) suggests that "life's not fair."huh??? this character also uses tears to manipulate her former lover into staying, and coaxes him into sexually oriented behavior (which she initially denies as a motive) all the while assuring him "this isn't sex."reverse the genders, have the leads played by tracey gold and brian austin-green and this could air in feature length on lifetime with a title like "hostage to obsession." there is no medically accepted definition of sound mental and emotional stability that would encompass tessa's behavior in this film.props to kristen thomson for playing a border-line psychotic, manipulative ex to a t, perhaps too well because there is no well-adjusted person, male or female, who could watch this and not have shivers run up their spine.

sorry, but jacqueline hyde (get it??? - jack l and hyde - jekyll & hyde) has some of the worst acting this side of hardcore porn, not to mention a script apparently written by a first-grader with undiagnosed learning disabilities.jackie hyde inherits an old mansion by a grandfather she never knew she had. guess who? yes, an inventor of the special formula that slowly takes over one's body and mind - yes, that mr. hyde! despite some nice skin scenes, this film fails to register any feeling or emotion other than uncontrollable laughter.as much as poor jackie tries she just can't stay away from granddaddy's special formula and the result is an hour and half of wasted time.

jacqueline hyde starts like any other normal day for telemarketing individual jackie hyde (co-producer gabriella hall) until her boss (robert donovan) fires her for taking personal calls at work, however it's not all bad news as the call she took was from a lawyer informing her that her grandfather (malcolm bennett) has recently died & that he left her his mansion & fortune (why doesn't stuff like that ever happen to me? sigh). very excited jackie heads on over there & makes herself right at home, while looking for the thermostat late one night jackie stumbles upon a secret room where her grandfather stashes the bright red formula that he invented that allows whoever drinks it to change their appearance. being a bit on the porky side jackie finally settles on the glamorous jacqueline (blythe metz), however jackie's better looking alter-ego starts to take control...written, co-produced & directed by rolfe kanefsky i thought jacqueline hyde was complete total & utter crap from start to finish & it's as simple & straight forward as that. according to the opening credits jacqueline hyde was 'inspired' by the classic robert louis stevenson novel 'the strange case of dr. jekyll and mr. hyde', frankly if mr. stevenson could see what was being done to his story here he'd turn in his grave. for a start i think jacqueline hyde was/is intended to be a horror film, the imdb certainly lists it as such but there isn't any horror in it at all apart from just how bad it is. i would say that jacqueline hyde is more a soft-core porno than anything else & extremely tame with it, why sit down & watch this softer than soft porno crap when you can watch you proper hard-core stuff that actually delivers the goods? why, that's the question i ask here. it's not even good porn either, besides being far too soft it's dull, boring & the not-worth-mentioning sex scenes are few & far between. the most intelligent aspect of this film is the title which would have been quite clever if not for the fact that another film used the jacqueline hyde (1998) title during the last century & judging by the imdb's plot summary it sounds a hell of a lot better than this piece of rubbish. this is one of those films you have to watch yourself to see just how bad it is but just hope that you never get the opportunity.director kanefsky was obviously working on a low budget but that's not an excuse these days, shot on a digital camcorder the film looks cheap & the few instances of cgi look like they came from a nintendo gameboy, the final 'shocking' twist has probably the worst morph effect i've ever seen & is pretty good for a laugh as is the scene when jackie's breasts grow via more terrible cgi. that's another thing, the film takes itself far too seriously. the subject matter sucks, is far too predictable & makes for a poor film but maybe if the dialogue had been intentionally funny with some dirty porn talk the film might have been more fun to watch, alas it isn't so it isn't. forget about any decent horror, violence or gore as there isn't any apart from a surprisingly bloodless decapitation at the end.technically jacqueline hyde is home made film type stuff, the photography is of the flat hand held point-&-shoot variety, the music, production design & special effects are of a suitably low standard to match the script. the acting was awful, seriously this is bad.jacqueline hyde in my opinion a load of crap, there is not one positive thing about this turgid film that i can think of. any proper film lover will have an almost impossible time trying to find any redeeming value in this crap, definitely one to avoid.

even with it's low budget this movie could have been worth watching if there was a story to tell here. it started out pretty good, and fairly engaging and believable. the actors and characters were interesting although there wasn't much character development. my favorite scene was when they were all eating their rations. some seemed to hate it, and some seemed to think it wasn't too bad. the story starts out very airtight. and then... and then it dipped into a little horror which is usually a death sentence for most sci fi. suddenly no scientific basis for any of the goings on. no real believable end game for the villain? no real explanation of what's going on. generally if a movie has to use the f word for every other word it usually spirals down from there too. i still get offended believe it or not. i often wonder what inspires people to make bad sci fi? isn't there a universe of fantastically good stories out there? don't people feel like they are wasting their time and everyone else's when they put out stuff like this. why do we get so much mediocre sci fi like this? no female actors/characters either? none at all? this had the makings to be another "predator" but alas fell far far short. my final comment - poor editing and finally too low a budget to build a real campfire? what gives? my advice for any low budget sci fi movie production companies out there. make sure you got a good story before you start, and edit out bad special effects - it's better we see nothing than something that looks fake or ridiculously fuzzy.

going to need to take a deep breath for this one...terrible special effects that tried to reach far beyond the limitations of the budget. blatant and unashamed plagiarism of other sci-fi movies (like pitch black). terrible acting. endless slow motion scenes of characters walking aimlessly across sand dunes. meandering dialogue that does nothing to further the story. characters wearing turtle neck sweaters on a desert planet with two suns. a "cargo" ship staffed by a camouflage-wearing crew of gun-toting soldiers (why exactly would you need forest-camouflage in space anyway?). some of the worst casting choices in the history of no-budget film-making - a steroid swollen "captain" who comes across more like a muscle-beach jock than a trustworthy commander, and a "convict" who looks and acts about as dangerous as a bunny rabbit. 70 minutes in length, 35 of which could have been trimmed out if the director had any concept of "compression of time through editing"...i won't go on. suffice it to say that while some components of this awful movie can (and should) be forgiven due to it's low budget; the bad conception, laughable plot holes, and snore-inducing script are unforgivable on *any* budget. the end result is a tedious, dull, waste of time. sorry guys, i hate to be so harsh on an amateur film, but you've no excuse for turning out this kind of work.

i was excited about this movie after reading other reviews. what a disappointment! there are so many ways that this movie is bad. the computer graphics were lacking to say the least. i found the acting stiff and unbelievable. watch the sand as the lost "e-pods" (what an original name!)are found. where did all the tracks come from? i immediately recognized portions similar to other movies, ie alien, pitch black. come on,one huge ship to transport one prisoner? and what is with the prisoner? does he speak, can he speak? i kept waiting for something to tie the bits of the story together, but it never came. if this movie was made on a low budget, it shows. the only part of the movie i liked was when it finally ended. i don't mean that i liked the ending, i didn't. i just liked the fact that it was over. a trip to the dentist would have been more enjoyable. in my opinion. don't waste your time on this one.

it is ok movie if it would be done by high school kids for their friends. it is way below limits be called "professional". there isn't plot, no actors' play and visual looks like you see it through the plastic film. i was so glad that i have ff button on my remote, 32x worked really well. i understand that everyone need to start somewhere, but it shouldn't be reason to bring it to the public. if you have concerns about quality and budget - "open water" was made on $60000 and more than half went to the guy who provided the security in the ocean and trained sharks. and that movie looks 100 times more professional and it was an event in the indy film-making.

this (very) low-budget film is fun if you're a john krasinski fan, but is otherwise disappointing. at least it was short, so i didn't feel like i had wasted too much of my time. john's scenes are funny enough, but the attempted 'deep' scenes with lacey chabert are pretty nauseating. it starts off seeming like it could be a funny movie, but some of the characters are just so outlandish while the others are far too serious that it just falls flat. don't get me started on the ending. it was totally implausible and didn't even fit with the rest of the movie. i will say that i wasn't bored, though, which is why i rated it above a three. fans of john krasinski will enjoy seeing him with a bandanna and stockings around his head, and eating cheez-its. oh, and make sure to check out john's deleted scenes, they're better than some that were actually included in the movie.

i have to say, krasinski is the only reason i even watched this film. he is good. however, everything else about this film is so far below average that it's not worth the time and effort spent viewing this film.this film has loads of technical/aesthetic issues: namely, shot selections, framing, camera movements within monologue sequences, extremely bad editing (probably due to the total lack of fluidity in and between shots), and overall terrible acting (except for krasinski).it was far too theatrical (in acting and presentation) to develop any sort of suspenseful moment in this film...which is surprising, because it's all about a bank robbery, which should be at least somewhat exciting.how does a film this bad get made, and then released, and then distributed?kind of reminds me of a c- film student's thesis project, probably not even that good though.

i found this movie to be okay.on paper, this movie has everything a person may want! romance, comedy, drama. a bank robbery, a unique cast, great music and storytelling!in reality, this movie ended up being mostly garbage, and i'll tell you why.a) this is my biggest problem: the editing. this movie has by far the worst editing i've ever seen short of local-car-dealership commercials. the editing could've been done better by a deaf parkinson's patient tapping away at imovie with a a dead cat. there are scenes where two characters are talking to each other and you can see their lips moving and the audio/video isn't in sync because its clearly dubbed. why was it dubbed? i don't know! its english dubbing english! the voices were done in a studio elsewhere in certain scenes! could they not find a boom-mic?! they're not expensive; jesus, even i own one! and i don't make films!b) andrew keegan's performance lacked. it really didn't seem like he wanted to be a part of this project, and his acting was the equivalent of a skit performed by d.a.r.e. for schoolchildren. at least john krasinksi showed some enthusiasm.yes, john krasinski is the only reason i rented this flick, and its the only real reason worth watching. he's did a good, witty performance and he was the most three-dimensional character. dean edwards' character was quite thin, as was whats-her-face.final word? if you're a fan of john krasinski, this is worth your time. if not, don't even bother. the editing

why do they keep making trash like this? because it makes money that's why. eraser is not so much a film but a string of action set pieces strung together. it's well filmed but predictable and it's all been done before, only better. this is basically a nineties version of 'commando'.

!!!! mild spoilers !!!!with the exception of the terminator and total recall i don`t think arnie`s action/adventure movies are up to much . they`re better than his comedies for sure but that`s hardly saying much . the problem i have with his all action blockbusters is that they`re overblown and lacking in any sort of morality morality ? i mentioned in my review of terminator 2 the scene where good guy terminator blows the kneecaps off the swat team . are we to think that because the hero maims people doing their job instead of killing them we will admire him in someway ? this is the problem with eraser , when james cann`s character is revealed as a traitor within the us marshal department arnie`s character john kruger goes on the run with a witness he`s protecting but in several later sequences kruger kills a fairly large amount of marshals working with the villain . are we take it they were all traitors too ? surely many of them were honest men who were trying to stop kruger because the bad guy told them kruger was the traitor ? it`s a rather uneasy thought that kruger killed several people who were trying to genuinely up hold the law despite costing one hundred million dollars the special effects aren`t all that impressive . look at the scene where kruger lets go of the jet wing and scrambles to put on a parachute . it`s obvious as the action intercuts that it`s a stuntman who`s doing the free fall sequence while arnie is in a studio in front of a blue screen . eraser is also a film that has unnecessary cgi featuring killer alligators , not only unnecessary cgi but unconvincing cgi too . there`s also a few plot holes like in the opening scene involving a couple of witness protection people that the mob has caught up with . kruger opens a car trunk and pulls out a couple of bodies and starts a fire thereby throwing the mob of the scent . kruger is next seen rearranging the dental records via computer of the couple he`s saved . it would be logical to do this but would all the couples dental records be kept on computer ? most importantly of all are we to believe the us marshal department keep a freezer full of bodies for such events ?so they`re you go , a typical arnie thriller long on unlikely set pieces and short on intelligence and it`s interesting to note that eraser didn`t make much of a profit at the box office as the production costs almost outweighed a potential audience figure . after eraser arnie didn`t do much more business at the box office save for terminator 3 : rise of the machines which was an event movie and it`ll be interesting to see if he`ll be remembered as a politician rather than a movie star

you get an hour and a half of braindead i have to save the world action all the way, one liners and a woman somewhere in the equation. this time he plays a guy who help people in the witness protection program. to quote the cover of the movie. he erases their past to save their future. woppi, this have to be cool :) i bet younger people will like it though but it is a little over the top for my taste. and the one liners are really something else, and i don't mean that in a good way. after killing a crocodile he manage to say. "you're luggage" if you are in the right mood you may enjoy the movie. and as far as braindead action go, this is not very bad. but almost before the movie starts you know exactly what is going to happen. but if you like these kind of movies, you will probably enjoy this one. i rate this movie 4

this movie is proof you can't just go to a redbox and read descriptions of films and pick one and give it a try.while i'll give 'em great credit for having produced a film with halfway-decent special effects on such a low budget, and at least a halfway decent script and story line... unfortunately, it was only just that: halfway decent.if you like movies where things aren't all neatly wrapped up, and don't mind low-budget effects, you might like this film. honestly, it wasn't really my cup of tea. i should've just gone to bed rather than spend my time watching.for a better science-fiction movie produced on an even lower budget (!) have a look at "primer."

i love how everyone treats this show like it was the next great american sitcom. i watched five episodes of this abomination, and the only person that came close to an actual teacher was the old guy that sort of loved and hated his job. the rest of them were just pretty people trying to read the lines written by people who never actually went inside of a real classroom. i loved how every episode consisted of the two idiots (one who got laid and the other who didn't) getting into some form of zany trouble that indirectly involved their students. the british girl who thought she found an likable quality in the main idiot, but in the end was somehow shocked that he turned out to be a jackass. the hot chick that was there for the particular purpose of being hot, and the principal and her lackey that served to somehow move the almost non-existent plot forward. i loved how almost all the teachers on this show were very young, but i ask you to think back to your high school days and remember the teachers that you had . . . did they look like that? or did you go to the high school that had middle-aged people teaching in it? that is the high school that everyone else went to. the show lacked any form of research into what goes on in schools. in public schools, principals do not have the power to higher and fire teachers, the school board does, but in every episode that i watched the principal made threats to fire her teachers. think back to your history class . . . . . or think of any history class, did you ever see an incredibly hot british chick teach an american history class? no. did you ever see a teacher's lounge that is so huge that you could actually play basketball in? no.teachers could have been a great show had it actually of based itself in some form of reality. what makes teaching funny is the stories that you get from interaction with students, and the teachers find it funny because they deal with the students day in and day out. the overemphasis on their lives outside of teaching just made it another four camera sitcom that had unrealistic people in an unrealistic environment saying unrealistic lines, and i'm sorry, i just didn't buy it. the show could have modeled itself after other currently successful sitcoms and used a single-camera format, and it should have centered more around the teacher's relationships with their students and not with each other.it gets a star for trying and a star for the hot chick (she was really hot).in the end, it was a failed sitcom that will go down in history as a hacks attempt to understand a profession. i only hope that if they make another sitcom based on teaching that they learn from their mistakes so that a monstrosity such as this never touches the television screen.

these writers are trying to re-create the characters they have on "scrubs" in a different occupation however the characters they are stuck with have no charisma or acting ability not to mention the writing seems poor and effortless. these guys are trying to create something that would be good if the writing wasn't so disgusting which is leaving the shows only lifeline to be two attractive teachers that that are barely keeping it alive. the humor in this show seems like it is trying to target an audience with an i.q. of 40 or below. another reason why this show is becoming a failure could be that the writing on the show "scrubs" is excellent and this show has to follow it up leaving the viewer in an odd position not knowing whether to cry or to just lose hope in new sitcoms all together. this is just my opinion but i think these guys should stop now before they humiliate themselves anymore than they have already.

tim taylor is an abusive acholoic drug addict. he's a coward and a child and has absolutely no redeeming qualities as an actor or a person. the only film with him in it that is enjoyable is "galaxy quest" and that just because his character - a boozed out washed up actor from a former hit tv show - was so close to real life for him. the rest of the cast is equally bad. i hate the mother and the actress that played her patricia richardson, she sucks! ever cliché is there, the stupid woman who is fat and likes opera and only cares about her children, while in real life she's proclaims family values and gets divorced after having twins. and the child actors were about as interesting as a root canal.

honestly i don't know why this show lasted as long as it did. ah well, humor is subjective eh? but yeah, this show is incredibly unfunny if you ask me. tim allen is annoying. jill is annoying. the boys are annoying. al is annoying. the neighbor is annoying. it's just more annoying then funny. the plots are all the same, tim makes jill mad and has to make things right again. and the latter seasons? less said about them the better, who the hell things cancer would be good for a damn sitcom? yeah, great idea jerks. so yeah, home improvement isn't a very good sitcom. i'd recommend you go watch news radio or seinfeld. if i had to give this show a rating i'd give it a 1/10 seeing as it never made me laugh once. ever. so yeah, it's still better then the nanny though.

this show disturbs me. it takes up slots on nick at nite that could be reserved for the fresh prince or george lopez. even full house and roseanne. they're all better than home improvement. first off, the mother jill annoys me so much. she is an oversensitive whiny baby and i really despise her. brad is a fat toad, and he is annoying too. and the youngest brother, i don't even know his name! i don't notice him at all! that's probably not the actor's fault though, it's probably the writers'. tim is just a stupid ass. although jill is definitely my least favorite, i don't like any of them. the only reason i gave this stupid show three stars is one star goes to randy. as the middle child, he is still a pesky little brother, but an older brother, and i like his fun character. the other star goes to al. as the chubby friend, his character is likable. other than randy and al, this show sucks.

ok look this show is the worst show on nick@ night. i love so many shows on nick@night and i love them. when this show came on to nick@night i was so annoyed. it's such a boring show and it is corny. out of all the times i've watched i found one episode slightly funny. this show has some of the most unfunny and stupid jokes ever. this show sums up to terrible. give props to fresh prince of bel-air and george lopez. this show is boring and not the least bit clever. this show should have been canceled much earlier. i don't think it deserves to be played on nick@night alongside some great classic shows. this show is lacking cleverness, good jokes, and style.

i enjoy watching robert forster. that was the main reason that i rented this movie. i also wanted to see a story take place out in the middle of nowhere where the characters could work off of each other really well with no distractions. unfortunitaly i found the movie to be dull. i couldn't get interested in the characters. i couldn't get interested in the story which seemed to meander nowhere. after watching this movie for an hour i turned it off. i will rate the movie 4 out of 10. this falls well below the mandatory 7 rating that makes a movie worthwhile to watch.

i think its safe to say that if you only really watch box office standard films or any premium production don't bother with this film as you will hate it. if you are an overly critical film buff don't bother either. if you love science fiction films and don't care what capacity you get a glimpse of the future in then you'll be mildly entertained. it is very obvious that the budget for this was super super low but what they have done with the money is worth a pat on the back. some of the burning fire scenes were pretty bad and the evacuation scenes were terrible but it is quite obvious that they had some good support from a computer perspective as the planet scenes and the alien images were quite inventive. the dialog is down right hilarious but acting not altogether poor. as for the story well, i'm not too sure what actually happened at all to tell you the truth.

i think that you can not imagine how these people really work...!! before i came to the studios to watch the guys work there, i actually thought quite the same as you do. but since i saw and did the work the guys on that tv-show have to do, i have to say that they really do deserve respect for what they are doing all day long. that really is no easy work. and also the actors, which in your eyes may be terribly bad, are really great people and a lot of them really can act! i don't think that the material given to them can really show that, as i think this material isn't very good. but they are truly good! so i don't think that you, before you haven't seen these guys doing there work, can judge over them! and i shouldn't have judged over them as well before i met them, but i did and am now terribly ashamed of it. so please, do not allow yourself to judge over these great people unless you haven't seen them doing there job.

i watched this movie only because i was under the impression that i was going to be treated to a cheesy horror flick. i mean, look at the tag line: "they're men turned inside out! and worse... they're still alive!" does that not scream cheesy horror movie to you? and the then there's the title itself-- "screamers." what a perfectly apt title for a horror movie, i thought! unfortunately, i wasn't aware that the real title was, properly translated, "the island of the fishmen."so, about an hour into watching this i realized that this was not a cheesy horror movie at all-- it was a cheesy "adventure" story about slimy fish-men from atlantis. "men turned inside out"? no. there was nothing of the sort. i was grossly disappointed.damn you, misleading taglines! i want those 81 minutes of my life back!

ok by the time you read this i might have stopped crying. this movie was so horrible as to be quite vexing. the creatures are kinda cute, but the only really good thing about the movie was the growing attachment among the prisoners and their guard after getting marooned on this daffy island. even seeing barbara bach with her hair all riffled was no payoff for buying this sterling bit of poop. she goes about with a whispery i've-never-used-my-voice-before breathiness that just don't wash when one is screaming bloody murder. (hey the leading man was cute too but i'm still not assuaged.) this is a cry-into-your-beer ripoff of the good ole island of dr. moreau. poor richard johnson, who was surely born for better things, is just unrelievedly bad as the bad guy. i mean, how bad can a bad guy be? (ask richard johnson). joseph cotten tries hard not to look embarrassed as he staggers through his cameo appearance. in the name of all that's holy, don't rent this darned bomb.

the `plot' of this film contains a few holes you could drive a massive truck through, but i reckon that isn't always top priority in horror. two elderly sisters in rural england keep their brother in the cellar since more than 30 years. now, he escaped and started a killing spree, focusing on militaries that are homed nearby. `we only did we thought was best for him' they keep on repeating and  strangely  all the army officers love these women and don't doubt their sincerity, even though 5 of their men died. i don't know whether to find the revelation near the end suspenseful  or tedious! in a way, this film reminded me about `arsenic and old lace'. in that black-comedy classic, two half-insane siblings mother their goofy younger brother as well, yet they do the killing there. the old ladies in `the beast in the cellar' are by no means less crazy, though. the `horror' in this early 70's film is very amateurish and cheap, but there are a few neat attempts to build up the tension. too many `old-ladies' talk about the good ol' days, though and that rarely is something you seek in a horror film with such an appealing title. flora robson, who may be recognized by classic film buffs, plays one of the sisters. she gave image to the queen of england is the legendary errol flynn swashbuckler film, the sea hawk.

yes, the video cover of this movie made me want to watch this film as a child. it was called "screamers" on this particular cover with the tagline "men turned inside out!". it even featured this warped looking skeleton on the cover as well that made all sorts of cool gory images run through my mind. perhaps some sort of movie about some strange virus that caused a person's flesh to burn off, maybe a movie about undead zombies that are more bloody looking than what you usually get, a science experiment gone incredibly wrong and now strange men with the flesh dripping off their bones go on the rampage. yes, all these thoughts ran through my mind, one that did not was fish guys on some island with virtually no gore and all bore. this movie is really more like the island of dr. moreau than anything else and quite frankly that movie bored me too, it is way to much scientist and not enough killing for my tastes. these films are to much figure stuff out and not enough blood for my tastes. yes i know, i have strange tastes, but i can not help it, i like my horror movies either really bloody or fast moving and exciting this movie is really neither.

i remember viewing this movie when i was a kid. i recall it terrified me immensely and it stayed with me all these years. i spent a couple of years trying to find it online...didn't remember the title, only the storyline. after searching and searching, i came across a vhs that was being sold on e-bay. i was excited and when it finally arrived, i jammed it into the vcr and couldn't help but feel a bit nostalgic. needless to say, i was slightly disappointed. this wasn't the movie i remember watching as a kid. it was boring at times and i found beryl reid's incessant whinning extremely annoying. both performances by reid and flora robson were good overall but the movie wasn't scary. i think any movie is worth viewing to form you're own opinion but sometimes, well......

crash is supposed to be a film about racism in los angeles. but in fact, it's just a bunch of coincidences between several characters that connect each other during one day in one of the biggest cities of the world. who the hell is going to believe that? there are unrealistic situations, one after the other. on the other hand, this film pretends to show racism between asians, iranians, latinos, blacks, and whites. but the big error relies on a pre-establish racism coming from the writer. mainly because the white characters in this movie are usually portrait as people with a better social-economical status than the rest of the other races. iranians are poor, just like the asians. and latinos, as always, are portrait as housekeepers, police officers, or with a very low profile job like a locksmith. jesus!!! don't you guys think it's about time to change these stereotypes? same with blacks, portrait as gang members, with the exception of a black tv director, who was the only fresh character for me. this movie sucks so hard, that makes me so disappointed about the kind of cinema coming out from hollywood these days. always with stereotype characters. no realism whatsoever. nothing to identify with. it's simply a big waste because this could have been a great opportunity to show latinos, koreans, iranians, and blacks, from a different perspective.

given this film's incredible reviews i was expecting something truly exceptional. it certainly starts well with witty and sharp dialogue, and a fine cast in place. a series of robert altman-style interwoven stories reel the viewer in with some compelling scenes. i found it gripping entertainment right through to the second half of the film when sadly, it collapses like a pack of cards. a series of ludicrous coincidences and right-on messages stack up until i'm left deeply disappointed and wondering what all the fuss is about. paul haggis has tackled the subject of race in la, and that alone seems to have elevated this movie to a new level of interest. given that most of the academy voters live in la and have experienced racism to some extent, this film is sure to have an impact on them. that means the oscar for best picture will go to the race movie or the gay movie. let's hope it is the latter, because brokeback mountain is a bona fide masterpiece that deserves recognition.

maniratnam, who in india, is often compared with prominent world film makers and is regarded a genius in film-making, has yet again proved that he can only make the frames look visually good, without offering much food for thought.forget about pure cinematic pleasure that can be derived from cinema as a very old form of art.while i would not like to claim and portray myself as someone who has seen all the beautiful movies made around the world, still any thoughtful and a bit educated film goer can identify that his films do not contain innovative ingenuous plots, does not contain lingering effects afterward and mostly contain ridiculous ending and a lot of melodrama, seen profusely in indian movies.overall, maniratnam has successfully confirmed my distaste for his films once again.sorry for those who on this board were claiming otherwise. my suggestion to you: watch some beautiful cinemas made around the globe.

it's exactly what the title tells you...an island inhabited by fishmen. shipwrecked doctor claudio cassinelli and crew land on the island, they're either picked off by the fishmen or roped into working for treasure hunting lunatic richard johnson. cassinelli discovers that johnson, who believes he's found the lost city of atlantis, has been keeping disgraced scientist joseph cotten and his daughter barbara bach hostage for 15 years so the fishmen can uncover a treasure trove beneath the sea. cotten, of course, is a complete madman. bach and cassinelli have great chemistry. this insanity was directed by sergio martino and is not, surprisingly, without merit. it's fast paced, reasonably well acted and the fishmen look pretty convincing (though it's unlikely anyone could prove that these things don't look like actual fishmen). there's an excellent music score by luciano michelini.

i saw this movie as part of a billy graham program. the church i attend was part of a community wide outreach to present god and christianity to our community (hartford, ct. usa). i was one of the counselors who helped attendees (who were invited to come forward and make whatever kind of religious profession they wanted...and to follow up on them after the movie. as such, it did what it was supposed to do, and i personally found it to be a medium to strengthen my faith in god.i also found it to be very helpful to those i counseled. i especially like the work of kim darby in this movie. and the parents (the wintons?) were , in a way, a little overdrawn....no one says to their child if they think that he or she may be the parent of an illegitimate child something like the wintons did "oh, no, no, not thaaat." that isn't exactly what they said, but the sympaathetic audience i saw had a laugh at whatever it was they did say, and also at the son's emphatic "no, mom, not me." don berghuis

this version is very painful to watch. all of the acting is very stilted but especially that of norma shearer who is still acting as though she were in a silent movie instead of a talkie. check out the 1937 version with joan crawford, robert montgomery and william powell which is much more entertaining.

i found this early talkie difficult to watch and i'm a norma shearer fan! it's not her fault, but the primitive production values of this film would cause any viewer to become bored. 90% of the movie is filmed with "medium shots," and it's very similar to watching a dull play.

why a film maker with a track record like wes craven would want to lend his name to a tedious collection of cliches like this is anyone's guess. and if he did stump up any money for it - all of £50 judging by the looks - he should have been banging on the director's door for a refund the minute the film was released. there are many "alien" rip-offs and this is one of the worst. even the reliable lance henriksen, saddled with a character dumb enough to allow his kids to wander around a dangerous government lab, can't save it. as a cure for insomnia, this rates a 10+. as a piece of quality film making - forget it.

spoiler!!!! mind ripper hmmmm.... i had just watched the nightmare on elm street movies and had just found out about giovanni ribisi. i thought giovanni ribisi hadnt done any horrors so i checked into it. i saw "the outpost" (mind ripper) i checked on my tivo for it. there was an air date on sci fi. so i was set. i got my pop corn ready came in and set on the couch and what the hell is this? a freakin bold guy in blue sweat pants running around yelling! nothing is scary about this movie at all! if anything its funny! funny how low the budget is, funny how predictable it is, funny how bad the acting is and funny how much money it didnt make. ok giovanni ribisi is a good actor but this movie is dumb. it is so stupid. they killed him at the end and then they go on this plane and the "monster" is on it. they shoot him in the head with a shotgun and it falls a long way to the ground. and-gasp- the killer ending, its still alive! woohhh! scary! woooohhhh! sucky fat sack of crap waste of 2 hours.bottom line: you have somewhere to go and you need to kill some time. mind ripper isnt the suggestion. i'd rather sit out naked in the snow than watch this movie a second time.overall grade: f- - - - - - - - - - (enternal)

i really loved the millenium series, starred by lance henriksen, which is why i bought the film. obviously at some level it was a mistake. mutant/monster films are usually very bad and this film is no exception.the basic idea itself is not totally judged to fail (well nevertheless this film would never have been a success, even with a good director & actors), but the way it turns out this is just a b-class movie. the scenes that are supposed to be scary seem more funny to me and the critter is not credible at all.however, watching this film with group of friends in restless mood makes this film shine as it is so unintentionally hilarious.

the only reason i saw this movie was because it had giovanni ribisi and it was supposed to be "horror". don't be fooled, this movie has to be the worst "horror" film i have seen. it's about these people who go to a secret location which has a "monster" in it. the monster is a man with a deformed face running around in blue sweat pants who has a craving for brains. some people die, some people don't. in the end they throw the monster off of a plane and then fly away happily. but oh no! the monster is still alive after falling out of a plane! go spend 2 hours some other way like watching paint dry on a wall, trust me, it's more entertaining than this crap.

a 'wes craven presents' movie from 1995, directed by joe clayton and starring lance henriksen. a group of scientists save a dying man they find by their desert stranded government outpost by injecting him with their experimental virus, of course, one of their colleagues goes overboard and the virus transforms the man into a near unstoppable monster with them trapped inside. lance henriksen plays the morally offended researcher who leaves the project before all this, but returns after receiving a call for help to save the man (pre-unstoppable death machine mutation).deciding to combine two trips in one he brings his family along with him (they're going on vacation afterwards) and proceeds to give them entry to the top secret government facility, thus putting them right in the middle of the chaos within. in case you can't tell, this one relies on the viewer to work with it a little and put aside some petty (see: major and blatant) details.overall though: watch-able with mild bits of enjoyment. note: the outpost is commonly known under the title 'mind ripper'

you'd hardly know that a year later mgm put norma shearer in the divorcee which glows with mgm technical know how. how far they came in one year. cheney is a very stagey early talkie. the camera hardly moves. shearer is her usual charming self and rathbone does well in a romantic leading role. they are all very careful to speak clearly and slowly into the microphone source which does mitigate against a naturally flowing dramatic scene, but the play is a sturdy and fun warhorse so one can enjoy oneself if one's expectations are not too high. oh, by the way, the plot involves a ring of upper class jewel thieves who infiltrate themselves into society to prey on their victims. there are some clever twists in the script and true love conquers all. an oscar nom for best screenplay adaptation.

i truly was disappointed by this film which i had high hopes for. it seems to have been rushed out to take advantage of the success of screwball comedies at the time (including mgm's own "libeled lady", which featured two of the same stars) and the success of william powell and myrna loy. three years into their pairing, they were still attractive to watch and filled with fire in their scenes together, but a weak screenplay and rushed premise destroys any chance of it being a great followup to the previous year's "libeled lady" and the two "thin man" movies they had done prior to this. "double wedding" tells the story of a clothing store manufacturer, myrna loy, who is intent on dominating the life of her sister (florence rice), future brother-in-law (john beal), and her own servants (which include sidney toler and mary gordon). when the independent spirited william powell comes into her life, having distracted rice and beal from loy's constant control, loy meets her match. sounds good so far, right? yeah, an interesting premise falls short, sad to say, because loy's character is so one dimensional it is hard to even like her let alone see powell fall in love with her, which we know will soon happen. it's another attempt to put a career minded woman in her place by changing her views on her what kind of life she has been leading, something hollywood did often during its golden age. when loy says she doesn't have time to both run her business and have a man in her life, its a groaner.fortunately, other than powell, there is free-spirited jessie ralph on board. a salty wealthy older woman who helped loy start her business, she has an acquaintance with powell and can see immediately through loy's cool claims that she loathes him. rice and beal are a boring couple, and the whole premise of powell getting between them is senseless. then, an ex-wife of powell's shows up, which really isn't necessary at that late point in the story, and the final wedding scene (where a crowd of people try to get into powell's tiny trailer) is a weak attempt to bring some farce. (it is funny though, that powell keeps getting hit by items meant by loy to hit edgar kennedy with; those chuckles are most welcome, since there are so few others.) powell and loy would do better in two later screwball comedies, "i love you again" and "love crazy", which are sophisticated, witty, and fun. this film attempts to be all three, but ends up a sophisticated bore.

a feminist tract in which if you the viewer believe that: i) wild animals are seldom tamed by singing but instead attack, kill and eat (the line that grizzlies never attack unless provoked was a hoot - unless "provoked" means that it sees flesh); ii) homosexuality is both immoral per se -- and its acceptance almost always associated throughout history with signs of a society's dissolution and decay iii) few women are bisexual (in this one, virtually every woman is presented as having no preference for men or women) iv) divorce is far worse than infidelity v) land is there for human beings to use, develop and enjoy vi) it is as incumbent upon a mother of an adult son to keep in touch as it is upon the son vii) a mother raising her son alone is an unfortunate and real tragedy for the child viii) the idolization of a parent for worthwhile ideals is a good and healthy thing ix) adults continue to bear a responsibility for their sexual behavior, no matter their age, and the duty to engage in this most intimate and giving of acts only within the most intimate and openly sacrificial of relationships: marriage -- believe me, you are not going to like this film! essentially it's a howard stern sort of fellow who is brought down by a jane fonda sort of woman (think the electric horseman). it's ugly stuff because the values, the ideals, of the screenplay are all so harmful.i share the other objections about the odd things in the writing: a) why would this man lose every girlfriend he has -- because he refuses to reveal that his mother's death and funeral caused him to be unable to keep dates with them? it's a mystery why he just keeps saying "it was personal" when faced with angry and disappointed women. huh? b) there's an enormous inconsistency (i.e., the screenwriter wants to have it both ways) by telling us that the protagonist's mother loved the father with everything she had - and then later we're told that there was only one great love in her life - her lesbian girlfriend.c) the underlying legal assumptions are nonsense. we're never told that the executor has any right to live at the property - merely that she shall determine the timing of the sole heir's title and right to occupy the property. yet somehow the film makes it appear that the executor is the rightful occupant - which is crazy. (try to think of any executor of any will who uses the decedent's property before the will's bequests are fulfilled - it doesn't happen).d) the assumption throughout this film is that women are equally drawn to men and women - it's just absurd. thus, we're told: i) that penelope ann miller's character is dating other men near the end of the film - after having been with the decedent for five years - and before that in a fulfilling relationship with the protagonist, ii) that the protagonist's housekeeper after being devoted throughout her adult life to her kind husband - is now dating another woman iii) that one girlfriend upset with the protagonist would now therefore "like to try a woman".iv) that a male transsexual is eager to date the protagonist v) that mary kay place's character naturally looked at other women in college ("and they looked back" she says with an idiotic triumphal flip of the head).this is all just ridiculous.i agree with others about the sound of the dvd (i had to keep it at maximum volume and repeatedly rewind to understand names, phrases).this is a film by someone who really despises traditional heroics by any man, hates the notion that a man is needed to raise a child, loathes the idea that there is any necessary connection between marriage and sex. the film is out to preach - and that kind of propaganda of false messages doesn't sit well.

subject matter: worthwhile acting: fair (some of it) plot: ridiculous details: sound goes from screechingly high to nearly inaudible; music is not altogether awful (but mostly is); dialog and characterization are laughable; the main character's process of discovery is blindingly obvious to everyone but himself (and the writer, apparently); animal scenes are just plain stupid (singing "moon river" in an off-key, forgotten-lyrics, silly duet to a "herd" of wild boars for hours, as one example). finally, the "wet t-shirt" contest is so over-the-top silly that it has to be seen to be disbelieved. (hint: the 'girl' who wins is not a ... well, i'm not giving that away.)

despite the solid performance of penelope ann miller, this movie was an awkward mess. the lead character's american accent was ridiculous and he never seemed comfortable as a result. there was no chemistry between the two actors and i'm still not sure what ann-margaret was doing there.

the sound in this movie is a nightmare. that is the best i can say for this movie. any chance of a good story is lost once this films starts. the premise of the film sounds good. a playboy who comes to terms with the people around him. the plot is predictable and very dull. the wet t-shirt contest may be the worst scene i've ever watched and is almost worth watching in a mystery science type of deal. the sound is at times hard to hear and the main actor seems to not know how to speak clearly. his accent makes him very hard to understand. the only bright sport is the acting of penelope ann miller. her role is underdeveloped but she plays it well. in short, do not waste your time.

mgm tried pairing up and coming young men with the divine one to give them exposure and try them out as leading men. gable and garbo had chemistry in susan lenox but it was a lousy film. here in inspiration there is no chemistry whatsoever between garbo and robert montgomery and the script is poor as well. what were they thinking? the modern, fast-talking, wise-crack-snapping montgomery and the long-suffering garbo? it is a tale like camille. young student falls for woman of the world and is repelled by learning of her past, rejects her, takes her back, rejects her.... you get the picture. garbo is completely believable as a top parisian artist's model and completely at home, although bored, with her life at the top of society amidst her artistic friends and their loose morals. suddenly she is fascinated by this innocent. she finally gives up her life for him and sinks into poverty, only to be rescued by him and set up in a house of her own. ironically, he intends to marry and keep her on the side - so much for his pure moral ethic of earlier.the scenes are incredibly dull and boring and nothing much happens. only marjorie rambeau as lulu is able to inject life into the proceedings with such lines as "unfortunately weak women have strong appetites" and "odette, where is thy sting?"only for garbo fans.

this movie is, in all likelihood, the worst film ever made. it is certainly the worst that i've ever seen, and i have seen a lot of bad movies.in this, nothing at all interesting happens throughout the movie. one could, literally, start the movie, take a short nap, and then wake up secure in the knowledge that nothing interesting has happened while you are sleeping. and i have seen this movie three times, staying awake throughout. i feel i should be congratulated.the movie goes as one might expect, according to a formula, with no variation. hunters capture baby bigfoot, get killed by parent, and the nearby town goes into a bigfoot killing frenzy. this is surprisingly boring for a troma release.so please do yourself a favor, and skip this movie. if you have to see it you will understand why.

the capture of bigfoot is one of the silliest and worst movies of all time. i love sasquatch and bigfoot movies but this one is just a sheer waste of one's time.terrible, terrible, terrible!i watched this movie last night, and it was all i could do to finish watching.i understood that this weird crazy man wanted to capture bigfoot,but that was the only thing that made sense in this movie.it did have some amusing parts though.there was this very cheesy and corny disco club with very bad disco dancing that seemed to go on for far too long in the movie.i think the director was trying to fill time.the worst thing was the way the bigfoot looked.the obvious man in a suit looked like a pink faux fur bigfoot.it was laughable.if you want to see a very bad bigfoot movie, then i suggest that you purchase this movie.personally, i wasted my time and my money on this one!

bill rebane's "the capture of bigfoot" is one of the most awful horror movies ever made.a greedy sawmill owner harvey olsen(richard kennedy)decides that he wants bigfoot captured at all costs.however local game ranger dave garrett(stafford morgan)learns that the bigfoot used to live in peace upset by a geological expedition,and sets out to protect the creature.there is nothing even remotely interesting in this piece of crap.the film is extremely dull and filled with horrible songs and cheap special effects.no gore,no suspense-just gigantic boredom.avoid this horrible junk like the plague.

its a sin how these things are made, but then again we wouldn't get to see the best "dummy scene" ever filmed. ahhh the beauty of low budget bigfoot flicks, you lean to see the beauty the more you watch them, thats if your brain doesn't melt first. as i said before, this has the best dummy scene ever! words cant express it, you have to see it for yourself. wonderful lines such as "smells like decain flesh", "thems human..."(you will know this one when you see it) the creature makes a blah, blah! sound and the scene where the baby gets shot will make you cry(with laughter) you will be rewinding it. has a car chase, snowmobile chase, a bigfoot folk song as well as a disco song. it dosn't end there, while watching the credits a friend noticed "wardrobe provided by k-mart". you ask, how could you even get as far as the credits and then watch them? i could only explain this as a sort of shock to the brain, you are so mentally exhausted you cant move and also i guess you have to know who was behind the mess. all that being said, this is a must see especially if you want to punish yourself mentally. its a keeper!

zero stars out of ****endless descent has absolutely no redeeming values, whether it's the ridiculously bad acting, the laughably awful special effects, the incompetent direction, the stupid script, or the gratingly annoying musical score. it's the kind of pitiful production that makes me wonder how a movie like this could even have the slightest consideration for being greenlighted by a studio in the first place.i don't think i'm going to delve into the plot other than to say it's about a bunch of people who are trapped under the water and have to kill a lot of fake-looking creatures.let me go more into detail as to what is so awful about this flick. first of all, the acting is simply horrendous. jack scalia is ten times worse than sylvester stallone, a feat that is hard enough to accomplish as it is. the supporting performances aren't really any better. and what is with actor luis lorenzo, the guy who plays the cook, francisco. he has a high-pitched voice and an accent that sounds appropriate for a comedy, not a sci-fi horror film.the special effects are even worse. the creatures range from weird-looking eels to giant starfish and "mostquitoes." the effects look like something you would see in a muppet movie, and i don't believe i need to delve further in this issue.director j.p. simon has slight cult status because of all the terrible films he's made. i'm sure some will enjoy endless descent in an ed wood type of way, but i don't even think it's that good. everything he does is shoddy, especially the camerawork. the man cannot direct a movie, that's all there is to it.this was the last of four films that took place underwater, and it sure does make leviathan and deep star six (both bad films in their own right) start to look masterful in comparison. either way, just stick with the abyss.

an awful b movie at best with video quality similar to dead alive. i challenge anyone who is a "aliens (james cameron 1986)" movie fan to count how many times either lines or almost entire sequences were ripped off from the first two alien movies to make this classic piece of garbage.cast members such as r. lee ermey and ray wise were the only two actors with any talent and the lead "jack scalia" was really absolutely horrible. i think they cast him for his massive cleft chin. i was also annoyed with the stereotyping of the only black male on the set john toles-bey who must look at this movie and just wonder. look him up sometime as he has done a lot of interesting movies.but on this movie: the script as i said earlier was a rip-off of aliens tweaked and turned into a submarine "thriller". it included such lines as "i got a bad feeling about this" and "kill me" as one crew member is infected by one of the mutants and his belly starts doing the "alien hop" just before it pops out of his stomach. there is also a rip-off of the classic "get some!" via bill paxton. we also have a bunch of navy grunts running through caves with creepy crawlies popping out of walls. even the explosions of the mutated creatures is very similar to the popping of aliens as they charge marines in the movie "aliens". and the kicker is that some of the mutants spit acid (as opposed to having acid for blood). there are many more major examples. so if you want to see this script done well watch the first two classics alien and aliens (with sigourney weaver). you'll have a more enjoyable time.the plot could have been interesting and done better if not for confusing sequences in the start of the movie and generally poor editing. camera shots were pretty dull and honestly it wasn't very hard to stop watching it and walk around the room to get a snack or check email. many of the interactions between characters made little or no sense and went nowhere more often than not. the whole command structure between crew and capt. was poorly done. i'm not even sure if there are captains in the military that have full control over nuclear subs. in general this just shows that there was little research done for background information to make the movie seem at least a little respectable and there are many other similar examples (like dive depth etc..).if you like horrible movies or are a big fan of alien and aliens and want something to just laugh and shake your head at then this movie may be for you. as for me this one is going back on the shelf...permanently.

it's difficult to find anything worth of praise with this movie. it's not the worst picture ever made, but that's not saying a whole lot. the plot is quite incoherent and unbelievable; it seems that the producers wanted to make a space movie, but decided to make it underwater to cash in at the success of the abyss. in some scenes it seems as if the story indeed was set to outer space initially; the sub has a landing gear, the technicians are worried of a rip in a rubber diving suit at the depths of several kilometers, where the pressure would crush the diver and the suit like an empty beer can. the movie starts out okay, with planning of a recovery of a lost naval sub. after that the movie takes a plunge along with the siren 2.effects are so-so. the navigational screens are all done on commodore 64 (remember, this is 1990, not 1983), the sub is controlled like no other sub ever; instead of control consoles, the officers have keyboards with which they enter long number sequences to control various functions of the ship. the interior of the ship isn't too convincing either.the final scenes leap from awkward to absurd. welcome to the fifties, you can check your suspension of disbelief at the door.i fail to see enjoyment factor here. the movie is neither good nor hilariously bad mst3k-style (until you get to the final scene), it's like eating a slightly bad apple.

if you like poor se, (some) bad acting and a total lack of credibility, this is a movie for you. so a really cheap looking movie, but i liked it anyway. why? because i like those kind of movies. i can't help but smile when i see these kind of movies....... what were the producers, actors, director and se people thinking when they made this film? don't expect an "abyss" or "alien", just a (very) low-budget horror/adventure movie.there is one nice "splatter"moment when a guy's head is shot off, but for the most, the horror is pretty tame. the final monster is pretty cool too.it's only 73 minutes long, so you can t go wrong there. maybe you can pick it up at your local videostore or watch it on tv. i'm sure you will have a good time watching it.but don't say you weren't warned.............

i love juan piquer-simón! he's my absolute favorite bad-movie director and, throughout his whole career, he incompetently tried to cash in on simply every successful contemporary trend in the horror and fantasy genres. after the big hit that was "superman", j.p made his own and hilarious "supersonic man", he picked in on the violent slasher-movie madness with the insane "pieces" and he really over-trumped himself with "the return of e.t.", the unofficial and downright laughable sequel to spielberg's sf-blockbuster. "the rift" is obviously inspired by the series of profitable underwater monster movies like "the abyss" and "deepstar six". from start to finish, you can amuse yourself by spotting all the stolen ideas and shameless rip-offs of these (and other) classics. when a completely new and fancy type of submarine vanishes near the deep dannekin rift, a second mission with u-boat designer wick hayes on board is sent out to investigate what really happened to siren one. in the dark depths of the ocean, the rescue mission discovers an underwater cavern where the government secretly experiments with mutant sea-creatures. the monsters are quite aggressive but there's also the danger of a government enemy among the crew members... "the rift" is a forgettable film, but it nevertheless has some ingenious  though very dodgy  monster models. fans of blood and gore won't complain, neither, as the beastly attacks are quite gruesome and merciless. the acting is very wooden although many of the cast names can definitely do better. it's advisable that you simply enjoy the clichés and gory effects in the "the rift" because, if you start contemplating about the screenplay, you'll find that it makes absolutely no sense.

the fact that this movie is bargain basement quality is a real shame, but back in the 1940s, that was about the only type of film made for theaters catering to black audiences due to segregation. so, while mgm, warner and all the other big studios were making extremely polished films, tiny studios with shoestring budgets were left to muddle by with what they had. and from seeing this movie, it's obvious that a lot of energy went into making the film, even if it is a pretty lousy film aesthetically speaking. some of the actors weren't particularly good (especially the french guy), the sets were minimal and the plot totally silly but the film also had some good music--of varying styles from classical to jazz to rhythm and blues. this is thanks to many talented but pretty much unrecognized black performers.now as for the plot, it was totally stupid and silly but still watchable in a kitschy way. i loved seeing tim moore ("kingfish" from the amos 'n andy tv show) in drag, as he made the absolute ugliest woman in cinema history (this includes the bride of frankenstein and many others)--this is probably due to the fact that when not in drag, he was a pretty ugly but funny guy. if the man pretending to be a woman actually looked remotely like a woman, i doubt this movie would have worked as well. seeing this ugly and rubber-faced man with a cheesy wig still being ardently sought after by three suitors was pretty funny.this isn't a great film but from a historical point of view, it's fascinating and excellent viewing for young adults to know what america was like for blacks in this era. a very interesting and funny time capsule.

there's potential in there with "tell no-one". a curious and intriguing plot, and a french take on a very american story. but for me, the opportunities were not exercised here.although i liked aspects of this film, there were three prominent failings which pulled it right down to four out of ten.firstly, it's a silly, clichéd murder mystery. a particularly contrived murder she wrote or bergerac. being french doesn't eliminate this problem - it's just silly and in french at the same time. it's full of implausible coincidences.secondly, the transition from the us to france seems to have failed chronically. this french doctor hanging out on "the streets" of a french city with his new "homies" and their blingin' suvs... and then there's the car chases...but thirdly and mostly, it's just too darn long. to me, a film needs a good reason to be significantly over 90 minutes, and over two hours takes some serious justification. this once didn't have it.

it's unfortunate that many of the other detractors of this film seem influenced by prior biases. (i.e. anger at the gay characters, thinking french thrillers are bad, etc.) i will admit that i'm unfamiliar with the novel, but as a film, after about 45 minutes, i was rolling my eyes. hopefully i can explain in writing my complaints eloquently enough before i get sick of spending anymore time on this film over the 2 hours of its running length.(2 hours that felt like 3) don't get me wrong, i can sit through hour and a half silent films, 3 hour epics, i don't have a short attention span, nor am i so jaded by the mtv generation that i cant appreciate a subtle and slowly building film. here goes, my grocery list of complaints. first off, the ending. yes, it had a scooby-doo-esquire, character explains everything at the end. now i actually think for this movie, this was necessary.. the film had so many plot-twists, emotional revelations, new facts surfacing and being discovered.. one reviewer said it well: "..yes, it is a very logical story, but without the very essential back story (their childhood stories, the relationship amongst the 3 parents, the relationship amongst the two lovebirds and the son of the big man), it just doesn't feel right. i felt cheated " i won't throw in too many spoilers here, i could name specific revelations that i thought were unnecessary, but according to the reviews on here, there's a lot of people who seem to really love this, so i don't want to give anything away. i personally, can't stand soap operas. the complexity, and twists and turns, for me, snuffed out any impact the final revelations could possibly deliver. by the end, i seriously didn't care! there weren't any gaping plot holes necessarily; this seems like it could make a great book, in writing it is perfectly logical, but if i'm supposed to believe this is reality, something doesn't sit right with the pieces that have been haphazardly inserted. too often i felt crucial characters we were never able to get to know were thrown in to further complicate the plot, increase the emotion, and develop the mystery. the acting i had no complaints about, the directing, eh, not bad, but the plot, and especially its development, severely lacking. sorry to those that felt this was a perfect thriller, but i couldn't get into it. i gave this a 3 simply because i don't want to seem completely unfair, and it did have moments of slight intrigue and excitement. *major spoiler* and i have to mention it.. but when the father is making his revelation to alexandre and just when you think the plot couldn't fit in another twist.. "your father didn't die in a hunting accident".. i almost died.. when was the father at all developed or even really mentioned much in the back story?!! are you serious!! like the already complex plot involving characters from all the families and their relationship to one another wasn't enough!!? does the protagonist need another emotional whallop more than he has already been fed?! sorry i had to throw in such a spoiler, but that just bothered me as much as i've ever been bothered in any film.

i thought choke had potential, but i thought it could have been a much better film. it had some interesting twists and turns, but some of them seemed kind of pointless. when showing background on the two main characters, some of that really seemed to go awry. most of it was sort of useless and didn't help the movie at all. this was also not dennis hopper's finest hour. however, the main saving grace of this movie for me was michael madsen. his performance was excellent. in this movie, he almost makes mr. blonde look like a nice guy. all in all, it was watchable. still, i was left thinking some things could have been done differently. these things would have made the movie much better, in my opinion.

a blind person could have shot this movie better...seriously! the director is clearly a novice. he must be dennis hopper's coke dealer or something to convince him to be in this movie. i felt so embarrassed for dennis.to john, the director...please retire from directing. your contribution is not needed nor wanted. the medium of film is stronger without you. you are terrible at directing. stick to bagging groceries or something.this movie should've bypassed "straight to video" and gone "striaght to the trashcan." i'm a dumber person for having seen this movie. do not see this movie if you respect yourself and respect the artform of film!

like most everyone who views this movie, i did it for the stars michael madsen and dennis hopper. the two are extremely underrated and sadly, because of that, have to headline a lot of crap. in this film, hopper plays a guy who accidentally kills a blackmailer and is offered help from the mysterious madsen.the film actually isn't as terrible as it could have been. i've seen both in much worse, both independently and working together (lapd, horrible film). the direction was pretty poor and the script needed a few re-writes, but both give the best performance possible with the material offered. also the ending is pretty strong, so you can tell the story had potential. but when a glowing review of a film is, "it could have been much worse", it doesn't say much for the film itself.all in all, this is one that can easily be skipped if neither of these actors draw you in. but if you're a fan of either or both, give it a watch. they both give strong performances that outshine the obvious flaws of the film. trust me, there are much worse options out there.

i'd like to start by saying i would not go see this movie again if they were giving out popcorn made of solid gold and the ticket granted me eternal life. this movie was terrible. i can't give this it a truly honest rating because there are no negative stars. the acting is absolutely terrible. this movie is a travesty, based on the classic, "the most dangerous game". if you really want to torture yourself for 90 minutes rent something like gigli. at least j-lo provides some better scenery, ben should pacify the ladies viewing it. i'm not upset about the $7 i paid to see the move, i'd just like the 90 minutes of my life back."can you give me my time back!?!" samuel l. jackson, changing lanes

at times when i watch this movie i start to think that the people who made this movie were on drugs.what's wrong with this film i'll tell you bad plot,bad jokes.bad acting and flat-out characters everything just bad.the movie is about pest vargas a two-bit scam hustler who is given the chance at $50,000 to survive for 24 hours by a german hunter who kills people for a living.so now pest must think of ways to out think this hunter before he gets killed.i know what your thinking "what the hell is this?" a another wannabe ace ventura trying to get money really this plot is just dull and confusing at times it changes the story plot and you get lost during the film.as for the funny scenes this film i had a straight face oh yeah i did smile a couple times but nothing laugh-out loud.besides the jokes are corny and seen before it's like watching ace ventura meets dumb and dumber but bad.as for character development it's dry and flat.you don't learn much about the main character pest all you know is he's a annoying scam hustler but that's it he doesn't change his image or be a little smart just corny.as for the german hunter all you is that he's crazy and wants to go back to germany.really you start to wonder why is this guy living on an island if has money to go to germany.the hunter's son himmel fares better but not much.he's really a coward and is snake-obsessed for reasons by the end he stands up to his father and sides with pest.as for the acting no only were there any memorable perforamces but just over the top.for example john legizomo is so over the top with performance and dosen't fit in his role he's out of place as for jeffery jones who plays the hunter same thing but gives a stereotypical performance as well.as for the rest either just no used enough or just over the top.overall bad comedy that you'll find for $2.00 at k-mart.

i actually joined this site simply to write in about this movie. i was sitting in my living room and this movie came on one of the local channels. i made it about an hour through before i simply had enough. curious to see what the general movie-opinionated public thought of this movie, i looked it up on this site. i was absolutely shocked to see that there were an overwhelming amount of people that thought it was great. i needed to have my say, and here it is: this movie is absolute garbage. it was a chore to sit through. the "jokes" were uninspired rehashes from other, better shows and movies, and leguizamo's manic portrayal of this obnoxious character should only appeal to age ten and below. that actually may be a stretch even for that age. i'm all for slapstick ridiculousness, but there isn't even the faintest hint of wit or cleverness. i have an idea, lets take bad uninspired obvious jokes and play them at twice the speed. now that's funny. ha. ha.movies that you should see that take silly humor and add comic timing and originality: the marx brothers' a night at the opera, monty python's the meaning of life, south park: bigger, longer, and uncut,...and the list goes on. don't lose an hour and a half of your life on unmemorable crap.by the way, i can only assume that the reason that david bar katz (the other writer) did very little in film after this movie is because he was instantly blacklisted. i'm actually impressed that leguizamo was able to recover after this mess.

obviously, the comments above that fawn over the movie were made by someone who's on the crew. i don't recall ever seeing a movie that's more insulting to the talented actors or the audience watching. in my 30 years of watching movies, this is the only one i have ever walked out of. bad humor, bad jokes, bad gags, bad editing, bad plot, etc. note to producer: it's never funny to hunt humans based on race. great that you tried to be politically correct by incorporating all races, but you're still hunting humans based on race, and that's sickening.

this was the worst movie i have ever seen. i have to admit i didn't watch it from beginning to end as cleaning the toilet was more entertaining.the 'star' was the most unpleasant character i've ever seen, neither funny nor attractive, in fact, creepy and obnoxious are far too complimentary.it is painful to watch, there is no acting, especially not from the star who behaves as a doped up mentally deficient take off on one of those loud mouthed black actors.as horrible as it is to watch one of those can't shut up black actors, watching a puerto rican one is even worse. the name of the movie is descriptive, he is the pest. this movie is a must miss.

this is a terrible movie, don't waste your money on it. don't even watch it for free. that's all i have to say.

john leguizamo must have been insane if he thinks this was a funny movie. i laughed more times watching remains of the day. pathetic plot, unbearable acting. horrible music -- michael sambello is a "maniac."

just to save you the $3, or whatever it costs to rent movies at your local video store, and the anguishing hour-and-however-long-this-movie-is here's a simple plan. go over to a friend's house, talk them into renting the pest for you, watch the first 30 seconds or so and then make up some excuse to leave. the opening sequence is really funny, definitely worth watching. unfortunately, the other 99% of the movie is horrible. without the shower scene at the beginning this is one of the worst movies of all time.

i was unfortunate enough to see this movie at a friends' house. what an utter waste of time. what an utter and complete piece of crap this movie is! absolutely nothing is funny in it, from the shower scene to the insulting and degrading portrayal of germans. there is no plot, the acting made me gag and at the end, i personally wanted to beat john leguizamo with a stick. i thought john woo movies were bad.....this movie is officially the worst movie that i have ever seen.

this movie is pathetic in every way possible. bad acting, horrible script (was there one?), terrible editing, lousy cinematography, cheap humor. just plain horrible.i had seen 'the wishmaster' a couple weeks before this movie and i thought it was a dead-ringer for worst movie of the year. then, i saw 'the pest' and suddenly 'the wishmaster' didn't seem so bad at all.bad bad bad. excruciatingly bad.

obviously, this one doesn't aim for the brain : the so-called "humour" is based on farting and every cliché about any ethnic genre you can imagine, gays included of course, as long as they are not wasp. and a latino cowrote this ? besides, john leguizamo does have talent and charisma, but in such a self-indulgent movie it is a definite waste. what the point in trying to out-jim carrey jim carrey himself ? "the pest" of the title could then be this movie, almost as funny as bergman's finest. prepare to be annoyed, not amused

the sole reason for someone wanting to see this film would be because of john leguizamo. i remember the previews, and it looked to be another second rate comedy. but the fact that mr. leguizamo starred, tried to redeem it. his name, how known it was at the time or not, tried to sell it.i was pretty disappointed with the performance of leguizamo. his days on "house of buggin'" (an "in living colour" clone), were his tip-top. there is a fine line between wackiness and idiocy, and we'll just say that leguizamo crossed it tenfold. he looked like he was trying to be too outrageous and crazy for the camera. as a matter of fact, i'll say that he tried too hard. madcap humor spilled over into stupidity, and the film was spoiled. i can't say i blamed him, if you were given this opportunity, you'd try as hard if you could, right? your eagerness cost you dearly though mr. leguizamo...the pest follows in the tradition of any comedy film, and plays the "race card", and more. no group is left out from being poked fun at. blacks, latinos, whites, jews, koreans, germans, homosexuals, and the blind are among those singled out. again here, things get too overboard, and too much tries to get spoofed in too little time. the resolution of the film takes all of five minutes to clear up and move back to normality.when you have a film, and you're going to bypass plot and reality for comedy's sake, just make sure it's funny, or all you have is 90 minutes of senseless film. which would sum up leguizamo's "pest" quite nicely...

i am almost tempted to demand my money back from the video store. this movie plumbs the depths of inanity and is almost completely unwatchable. i never bail out of a film early but this was painful to view. a thorough waste of celluloid. my vote 1/10 (it would have been zero).

what a turd! i like john leguizamo but man this is bad. i thought spawn was the worst movie he had been in, but i was wrong. i like all types of comedy from stuff like ace ventura 2 to american werewolf in london. this is a piece of trash.

ok, i'm normally pretty open minded about movies. i can normally see a good side to a film which has been totally pandered by others. this is an exception.i won't waste to much energy telling you what happens, but think along the lines of bill and ted meets the worst police academy movie out of all of them and you won't be far off.the thing that really got me about this film was the stupid purile racism that was evident throughout. the general theme of latino/black guys = cool, white guys = lame is slightly amusing for the first couple of jokes but when the same joke has been reiterated for the 500th time (not an exageration by the way) it gets both tiresome and offensive.i spent months waiting for the laws of karma to get back at john leguizamo for this film. i had almost given up hope when the 'my vh1 awards' were screened live in the uk. what followed was mr leguizamo performing the rare feat of a comedian bombing on stage. you'd have to be a complete sadist to laugh at him. ahem. ha! ha! ha!

a friend of mine who has a mysterious knack for finding and - horrors! - liking bad movies recommended i watch 'the pest.' at the time unaware of just how truly pathetic his taste in movies was, i decided to give it a try.bad mistake.the story, although clearly ripped straight out of any sixth grade english textbook as far as the "manhunter" theme goes, would be amusing under the right conditions - good actors, writer, director, wardrobe, and so on and so on to almost no end. clearly these factors are absent.'the pest' is supposed to be funny, i think. i say "think" because i let crack nothing more than a slight smile throughout the whole film. not a guffaw, not a laugh, not a chuckle, not even a grin. a smile, at best. and that happened so rarely while watching this film i even remember how often i did smile - maybe 3 or 4 times at best.so do yourself an immense favor. never watch this movie. avoid at all costs.

i can't believe that there are people out there who voted 10 for this garbage! have any of you gained access to a computer in the madhouse where you are undoubtably kept, or is there a special colony where especially crass people are secretly imprisoned that i don't know about?if i was to say what i really thought of this film, none of it would get published.to begin with its 'star' is a no talent idiot who acts like a bad impersonator of jim carrey who has hoovered enough angel dust up his nose to resurface the sahara desert. his name will be a total guarantee that i will not watch a future film with him in it - even if he plays a rock hidden by a crowd.as for the 'plot'. one more crime that we can chalk up to the nazis is that they were so awful that they can be considered fair game as 'baddies' in tripe like this; mere criminals and murderers would have the audience on their side in a trice.to the people who made this movie - give up making films and if not then confine yourself to making advertisements, where your efforts will at least have the virtue of being fleeting in duration.finally, a criticism of imdb - why don't you have the facility to vote 'zero' for a film? or perhaps not. to express my contempt for this tripe i would then have to vote double zero, or something.

there is a famous short story about a man who becomes the prey of a safari hunter who has lost interest in hunting anything except humans. its quite good, and its been done and redone in film and tv many many times. some are notable, but this urbanized version, that injects the tired old racism themes, just flat out stinks. leguizamo's slapstick is almost as weak as the unfunny script. chaplin, this guy isn't. there must be people who find a dwarf who cant stop dancing funny, i mean i suppose it is funny in a pathetic freakish way, but its just not enough to carry a movie. you have the usual nazi holdover or neo-nazi whatever the heck we are supposed to think, type villain, who's son of course is gay, german accents...get the picture?

...un-funny and un-entertaining, possibly the worst movie i have ever had the misfortune to watch. think 'ernest goes to..' humour done even worse. myself and my girlfriend sat through it just to see if it could be as consistently dire as it seems in the opening sequence... yes it is. avoid at all costs.

only watched this to see joe morton in an early role and honestly wished i hadn't bothered, he can and has since, done much better than this crap. cannot understand why anyone finds this kind of stupidity funny but each to his own; it is an absolute mess and not funny in the least. no wait, one line only was funny, where mr kent (joe) and his family are having dinner with this nut job as he's been invited for dinner (lord alone knows why). pest to mr kent: you know what it's like dog, you've been there mrs kent: not lately, joe's expression was funny but that's it one line does not make a great comedy and this tat is so far away from being funny it should be consigned to the nearest trash cart, it's only good enough for that. joe morton - glad to see you don't appear in rubbish like this anymore; you are far superior and a great great actor.

i was initially excited about this movie and fully expected it to be a combination of equilibruim and farenheit 451. unfortunately, i was continually disappointed in the lack of depth and interest of the plot and subplots. midway through the movie, i divulged into poking fun at the characters and sets to avoid having to turn it off. i did enjoy the premise of a future with merged cultures and separation of the have's and have nots. what could have been an artful and intelligent look at the future is morphed into a plodding, semantic scifi channel midnight flick with horrible acting, cheap sets and a final gratuitous shot of tim robbins vagina. maybe he should stick to his socialist political ranting - it has all been downhill since shawshank.

this movie was released in all major cinemas in australia. i watched the movie on the weekend of 7th aug and i thought is was absolute nonsense (and i am using that word extremely litely). how it got released to every major cinema no idea. the plot seemed simple enough about the world being divided into subclasses and people needed identity cards and the actor tim robbins playing an investigator who goes to shanghai to investigate a employee stealing id cards, which turns out to be the actress samantha morton.you think from that summary the rest of the story should intertyne but it doesn't it just confuses the audience even more with different storyline that don't relate.if you thinking of seeing this movie let me save u the trouble do not get this movie.

i found code 46 very disappointing. i thought the concept was good and therefore had great potential as a movie but found that it didn't deliver. code 46 lacked thought and structure and the storyline didn't flow well. i thought that tim robbins character wasn't well developed, for eg. i thought there should have been more info and thought put into his family life and not have it completely ignored as i felt it was. when they were first in violation of a code 46 it was suggested that they were not to know that they may have been genetically linked but all the technology was available to them, he took her fingerprint and therefore genetic details when he was investigating the fraud. i constantly found myself waiting for something to happen and the story line to develop and yet it never did. i felt that the film had great potential to be intellectually stimulating but turned out to be the opposite. code 46 tried to be too clever and in the end just ended up lacking imagination.i would not recommend this film to anybody, the only good thing about the film was that it was relatively short.

interesting concept that just doesn't make it. i watched the whole movie, but had to read imdb comments to find out what code 46 meant. if/when it was explained in the film, i must have been in a coma, or possibly brain-dead by then. i only watched it for tim robbins. the fact that i did not know any of the other actors should have been a tip-off. we all have to start somewhere, but this film should not be it. as to the 'anti empathy virus virus'-holy utility belt, batman! where were the joker, the riddler, etc? also, why are the women all so damned ugly? if i want to see less-than-plain stick-figures, i'll just walk down the street. the best part of the film was the car crash. it was totally believable, and not over-the-top like most movie crashes.

bad dialog, slow story, scenes that drag on and are absolutely pointless. i can't believe this much money was invested in such a poorly written film. the directing and acting couldn't save this bomb either.50% through the movie and you're still waiting for it to start. they lay the foundation with the opening preface and then spend the next 40 minutes setting up nothing. you watch 40 minutes of footage that is absolutely directionless in an attempt to do what, i have no idea.much of this film is like watching a really bad french movie where nothing ever happens and the characters are just sort of dull, lifeless and egocentrics living without purpose or care.avoid this film at all cost. anyone that recommends it is setting you up for disappointment and you will undoubtedly question their taste and depth.

code 46 is one of those scifi movies where the government controls who you are allowed to love, and in fact will punish you if you try to procreate with the wrong person. the haves and the have-nots live in completely separate territories, the powers that be can remove your memories, etc. we've seen this stuff before, but that's ok- no movie is 100% original. this kind of premise is always fun to contemplate. unfortunately, just imagining such a future is more interesting than actually watching code 46. the characters are boring and rarely say anything interesting. maybe that's commentary on a dehumanized future, but it's still dull to watch. it's sloooow.at times the imagery is nice, but usually (coupled with its "evocative" soundtrack) just looks like a glorified perfume commercial. code 46 also sometimes uses the kind of television camera-work that i find annoying. you know, two characters talk as the camera artlessly "floats" on one side. two seconds later it's floating on the other side of them in a vain attempt to keep your attention.my friends liked this movie. if they tried to get me to watch it again, i probably would not do so unless they agreed to pay me $50.

apparently i am swimming against the tide of the glowing comments on this film. i have not seen it since i was 4 or 5 years old but there is one thing i remember distinctly...the bunyip was terrifying!!! nightmare inducing terrifying. with the creepy music and the little girl and kangaroo running/hopping away for their lives...as a kid i also remember the animated hobbit... no worries. watership down? didn't blink an eye. dot and the kangaroo? it still haunts my dreams. and i have several friends the same age who also think it was massively creepy. maybe we can get a group rate on therapy.in short: one freaky film for its time.

well, shuck me sideways. i haven't seen a home movie this bad since the abysmal 13 seconds or half caste. someone should take away this guy's sony handycam! this movie proves that just because you can make a movie on your camcorder for $20, doesn't necessarily mean you should.i remember that one of the things that robert rodriguez wrote in his book, "rebel without a crew" was that when you set out to make a no budget feature, you have to use whatever assets you have at your disposal. rodriguez says that you should take an inventory of all the locations and props that you can beg, steal and borrow from your friends. robert rodriquez was friends with the mayor of some town in mexico, so the mayor let him shoot all over for free. what you got in el mariachi was a movie that looked like it cost much more than the actual budget.i'm sure that the director of this movie has a copy of that book, and he took that advice to heart. in this case, he was apparently friends with a guy who owned a cornfield where they put on a haunted house every year. seems like a pretty good location for a scary movie, but it's hard to keep a cornfield interesting for 90 minutes. not a single installment of the children of the corn series spent more than a few minutes in the cornfield. hitchcock only spent about ten minutes in one in north by northwest. take a hint, fella... cornfields don't make for riveting cinema. it would have been good if the director would have had more friends with more locations, because this thing gets pretty tedious after the first 15 minutes. this movie looks like it cost about $30. (or whatever it cost in admission to the cornfield maze).apparently he couldn't even find anyone to act in his movie, so he cast himself. big mistake. here's a thought, if you really want to make a movie, get an actor. so, as far as assets go, it seems like the cornfield maze is the only thing the poor guy had. maybe he thought that was enough. in fact, i'm going to go out on a limb and say that i know he thought that was enough because the movie, before it captured the coveted honor of being the sequel to dark harvest, was called simply the maize: the movie. maybe this he's already planning the maize: the musical or even the maize: the mini-series.our jack-of-all-trades (and yes, the master of nothing part of that saying is definitely appropriate here) plays a psychic dad who can tell when bad things are going to happen. think of the character from the dead zone, but not anywhere near as good an actor as christopher walken or even anthony michael hall. psychic dad has a premonition that his two daughters, who are at the corn maze with mom, are going to be killed. he rushes to save them. from that point on, the whole movie is spent watching pyschic dad run around in a cornfield, looking for his two daughters. he finds the two little girl ghosts from the shining, and he helps solve the mystery of their murder.shot on a $200 handycam. the director cast himself. edited on imovie. improvised story. if that's not enough to keep you away from this a-maize-ingly corny catastrophe, consider this as a final warning... the whole movie takes place in a cornfield, boils and ghouls. here's ghoulie guru's tip on how to save some money and still feel like you've seen this movie. next time you see a cornfield, stop the car. take a flashlight and go run around in there for like 90 minutes.

my spoiler is in my pants because thinking about this movie made me so angry i crapped myself.once you finish watching it, you stare at the tv set in confusion and horror. then, there's a soft tap on your shoulder and a voice hisses, "you will die in seven days." you turn around, and one of your best friends is standing there with a look of absolute hatred for the one that suggested this movie when you were in blockbuster.i won't lie: this is the worst movie on the face of the earth. i saw it with 5 of my friends all 18-year-old guys, and these were our reactions: -one person actually began crying and punching himself -one person screamed and passed out -one person stood up and staggered out the front door to reappear more than an hour later -one person simply blacked out (this one was me) -one person started babbling incoherently, as if he had both cerebral palsy and touretts' syndrome -one person went into a sort of catatonic trance and did not respond to our voices for more than twenty minutesthe movie really is that bad. there's one part where the retarded cameraman actually trips (while holding the camera), but the producers decided to leave it in. seriously, you can hear him grunt and swear when he hits the ground. there's only one special effect, and it's special in the same way that a retarded kid trying to solve a rubix cube is special: the camera rotates so that the on-screen action (action, n. some dumbass lost in a corn field for 80 freaking minutes) does a barrel roll.under no circumstances should it be watched, and the movie itself even warns you of this fact. do you know what the tagline on the back is? "some warnings should not be ignored." i honestly think that the release of this movie to the public is a sick practical joke on the producers' part. that's not to say, however, that you should pass it by if you see it at the movie store - it would then sit on the shelf for some other poor sucker to see. rather, buy every copy of it you can get your hands on and mail them to people that you hate.

this is by far the worst ever 'horror' movie, no, make that any movie, i have ever watched. shame on block buster for even carrying this type of crap. i never ask for a refund on any movie, but i think this will be a first.the movie is so bad that i had to stop after just 15 minutes of watching it.i had more fun watching any of the fuzzy youtube movies than watching this piece of dropping.the marketing dude for this movie must have some type of silver tongue to move this thing into an establishment as blockbuster.

this movie was so bad i don't know where to begin, apparently neither did the filmmakers. it starts off with a guy in his mid thirties to late forties watching tv. the news tells of a corn maze that's open for halloween. he has a "vision" of god knows what and rushes off the save his kids who are walking into a cornfield maze and are somehow linked to this "vision" how you ask? i don't know, and as i said before neither do the filmmakers. they're simply visions of people's feet. how did he get these "visions"? it's never explained, we're just supposed to go along with it. he enters the maze to find his two daughters who are lost inside, and twice the girls he's looking for walk right past him, one time they actually run into him. what does he do? does he chase after them? no. he stands there like an idiot calling for them when they just ran past. do the girls stop? no. they run off then ask "was that dad?" then someone dressed as demon jumps on the "star" (the dad character) he beats him up in a pathetic fight only to find out he's a worker at the haunted maze. the police are called and after finding the "star" (which is a really bad term to use) they cuff him. they cuff his hands in front of him, so that he can find something to pick the lock with, which he does. first off, anybody who's ever been arrested knows that cops cuff your hands behind your back, and secondly why does this "average guy" seem to know how to pick the lock on handcuffs? well he eventually gets away from the cops who give up and leave after a the "star's" wife sets off the siren in the police car as a distraction. by the way, it's now night time and all the workers running the maze have seem to have left once the sun went down. leaving a man who attacked one of their workers and two missing children in the maze. considering it was a slow night that these are their only customers, why not. besides the cops apparently have better things to do as well. by the way, the "star" who goes by the name of "walker", we figure out it's his last name, a name in which his wife even calls him by. somehow he knows there is something buried in the middle of this cornfield maze and starts digging. i say 'somehow' because i couldn't figure out why he started digging in the first place. he finds a locket, what does it mean? nothing to anyone who watches this, but to him it's some sort of clue to a crime. somebody killed their kids in his "vision" and i guess that's what he's going on, real detective work. and by now he knows there's a killer loose in the corn maze, one he somehow knew was there from the start of the film, which is why he's looking for his girls. every time we see the killer, or rather the killer's feet, we hear a weird robotic sound, like a sci-fi reject toy that changes a persons voice to sound mechanical. why do we hear this sound? is it in anyway related to...anything? again, who knows? certainly not the filmmakers. the peak of all the bad acting and bad dialog was when "walker" yells out "hey you, mr. bad man...i'm gonna get you." another time his wife is attacked by the "bad man" at the entrance to the corn maze, which like i mentioned before is oddly empty of any employees or policemen. the "bad man" calls "walker" on his cell phone to tell him that he plans on killing his wife and kids and him as well. "walker" can only reply with "hey. hey!" before dropping his phone and running off. with no one on the other end to talk to, the killer drops his phone too, he drags the wife a few feet then leaves her alone for the rest of the film, losing the first opportunity to hold true to his treats. if this script wasn't written by a child i'd be surprised. opps it wasn't. it was written, directed, and produced by the same guy. and not only that, he also did so much of the crappy camera work as well, where we get random shots of feet walking through the muddy maze and meaningless shots of the cornfield, that waste 90% of the film time. in the end "walker" uses the cuffs to cuff the "bad man", who also seems to know how to pick locks with the same metal object that "walker" had picked it with. apparently there are lots of small metal objects just laying around this cornfield. but after the killer insists he's still going to kill the kids "walker" kills the "bad man", and everything is right with the world again. now in reality this makes "walker" a murderer, he's killed a man who "supposedly" murdered his own daughters and was trying to kill his. he knows this, not because of proof, but because of his visions. he never found a body, nobody else knows this guy was even in the maze. and the locket? he gives it back to the ghosts of the two dead girls. no proof. so he kills a man without any tangible reason. i can't imagine what the filmmakers were thinking with this one. it must have been a way to cover up a misappropriation of funds for the production company. i would rather watch the blair witch project five times than see this film again. the actors should be ashamed. the director/producer/writer/cameraman should also be ashamed. in fact the entire production company should be ashamed. if there is anyone associated with this film, please reply. what were you thinking?

only adding to the chorus of people who deemed this to be 'unredeemable' i will state the following without repeating the obvious flaws plainly stated by some of the other commentators: the "film" is shot on video (what type of camera i don't know) but the cameraman had it on autofocus(!) all the time, so that any slight movement makes it go in and out of focus. in many of the scenes the actors themselves go out of focus for their scenes. this alone screams "amateur".i also noticed that out in the 'middle of the cornfield', you can hear the sound of the gasoline generator that is powering the lights ... loudly.also what is with that single lighting source that follows (and many times 'leads' the actors) when they walk around. it looks like a newscaster with that 'on camera light' that follows the people around like a spotlight. there was no 'credit' for lighting design/dp and i know why. the 'filmmakers' saw no need to have someone who actually knew what they were doing lighting this picture (note i didn't say "film"). so be prepared for a single glaring spotlight as the sole source of 'cinematic lighting' for most of the movie. ughhh!!!this is probably the most technically inept production i've ever seen commercially released. i "bought" this title because i like bad cinema. usually it's so bad that you can laugh at it. this is just so bad that it's unwatchable. plan nine from outer space is "citizen kane" in comparison to this title.

this is the worst movie i have ever seen, as well as, the worst that i will probably ever see. i see no need to rehash what all the others have said previously, just be forewarned...this is not one of those bad movies you think you want to watch because you want to be able to make fun of it, its just plain bad bad bad bad bad.this movie is the equivalent to having a "pet rock" as your friend. you wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait for something to happen. unfortunately, it never does. at least with a pet rock you knew what you were getting into. lion's gate completely deceives on this bombshell... no...this is a disaster. after watching this film, you would swear george w. bush had his hands all over the making of this film... yes its that idiotic.stay away, unless of course you just want to watch the worst movie of all time. its probably how lion's gate figured it would make some money off this piece of tripe.

anyone can make a movie these days. budget, production value, or experienced crew don't have to stop the self described "director" from "realizing their dream" these days.respect for the craft of film-making, or even just respect for any film aesthetic are no longer prerequisites for actually executing a film.director bill cowell must have thought he struck gold when lion's gate decided to market his original film as a sequel to a film he had nothing to do with.i personally find lion's gate far, far more in error than cowell in regard to dark harvest 2 being made available to the public. lion's gate's deceptive marketing of this film should be investigated by the state attorney general's office and lion's gate's officers should be pickled in sulfuric acid and kerosene for their utter disregard for film, film-making, and good sense.as for the film itself, it's not even worth commenting on.

completely agree with other review.i watched this movie for about 5 minutes. i looked up the one review on another site and found that it wasn't even a real sequel. this was after i slowly backed away from the tv with remote in hand, jaw dropping lower and lower. the quality of the filming is beyond low budget. it doesn't even look like a freaking movie. if i were watching 'home video' footage from a documentary i would expect it.in summary: avoid, avoid avoid. boooo lion's gate!completely ashamed of myself for watching 5 minutes and i hope that i've saved others from renting or owning it.

besides the comments on the technical merits of the production, or lack thereof, the acting is absolutely horrible. what is really scary about this movie is that i actually own a copy of it, of course, it was in a bargain bin and had been renamed as "dark harvest 2", and after having seen it, i can understand why it was in the bargain bin - they should have paid me for taking it out of their inventory.the majority of the movie, if you want to call it that, is spent by a frantic father running around a corn field maze looking for his daughters because he has a premonition that something is going to happen to them. i suspect that the camera that the girls were playing with at the beginning of the film was probably one of the production cameras for this fiasco. in the maze, he runs into the ghost of some children, which are poorly done, and the movie goes horribly south from there.i can see why they renamed this movie, otherwise, they would never have gotten rid of them. absolutely one of the worst movies i have ever had to sit through, and it wasn't worth the $2 i spent on it.

a guy, with the unlikely name of shy walker, looks for his two daughters in a cornfield for an hour and a half. that's the entire plot...with across-the-board bad acting, of course. walker wanders around a corn maze (maize? i get it! hahaha...not funny) and yells "girls? where are you?!?" about 1000 times. for some reason whenever he runs by a pumpkin, a chipmunk-sounding voice laughs (as if the pumpkin is laughing at him, yeah ok...). his daughters scream for most of the movie...even when there is no reason to scream (maybe because they are still stuck in this awful movie?). twin girls straight out of 'the shining' show up every now and then. most of the corn maze looks the same so walker's search gets very old very quickly. the filmmakers realize there is nothing going for this movie (even the music is repetitive) so they try to make things interesting by spinning the camera around really fast, filming upside down, inserting smaller pictures of the same shot at different angles, using red lights to make the corn look scary, and rotating the camera 360 degrees (at least i'm assuming these were done intentionally but it's likely just examples of incompetent film-making). more often than not, when walker is wandering through the maze, you can't see his face. i guess the kid holding the camera can't look up that high... this movie gives you a new appreciation for the original 'dark harvest' (which doesn't have anything to do with this movie except for the fact it also features a cornfield). don't be fooled by the r rating. walker says the f word three times and now we have "an r-rated horror movie", ugh. the scarecrow on the cover doesn't even show up in this movie...and when you are wishing that those cheesy scarecrows from the first movie would come back, you know things are bad! instead we get a guy in yellow boots chasing our hero around (unfortunately he is dressed similar to mr. walker so i didn't even realize he was being followed for a while). i figured out the identity of the guy in the yellow boots long before walker did (the movie is almost over by the time he puts 2 and 2 together, natch). the end of the movie drags on and on...and just in case it isn't slow enough, there's some slow-motion! the last sound you hear (besides your own laughter) is very poor sound-dubbing. in case you can't tell, this is the worst movie i've ever seen. at least they didn't end with the promise of another sequel!

this is absolutely the most stupidest movie ever produced in front of a camera. i cant believe i was gullable enough to rent this piece of junk. i have seen some bad movies in my time, but this takes the cake....ice cream ,,,, and chips too. omg, i still cant get over how bad this thing was. the acting was a joke.... the plot was non exsistant..and the camera work had to be done by a 3 year old child. i have never seen a movie take so long to go nowhere. i mean the whole movie could have been shot is less than 30 minutes. i guess this guy had some extra time on his hands.... ( like 3 hours. ) and an extra 60 bucks in his wallet, and decided one night...( hey ..lets go make the stupidest movie ever made. ) and they did just that. give me a break.i'm heading back to the video store right now to get demand my money back.anyone else who has watched this piece of trash, should do the same.

i rented dark harvest (the first one) because it looked like a cheesy monster-on -the-box type of thrill ride. scarecrows also freak me out. the movie had an effective title sequence, but what followed was pretty lame (flat, bad lighting, acting, editing, direction...). recently, i noticed that dh 2: the maize had a pretty extensive ad campaign. i thought maybe the first one was marginally successful, so they upped the ante on this one a bit, possibly delivering some bigger budget scares and fx from the killer scarecrows. well, there are no scarecrows in the video... not a problem. the problems start in dh 2 with a title sequence that looks like an unfinished concept, with strange shapes and bars wiping away titles and whatnot. as far as the actual photography... every time the sun shines in a shot, you'd have all these blown out whites, confirming that you're watching some ultra-low budget mini-dv project that some midwesterner filmed at his uncles farm. the acting was not acting at all. the cheap rip-off of the shining twin girls was below freshman film student standards. the editing was extremely amateur and lazy. the sound was jarring and choppy. (e.g.- every time the editor would cut to a new shot, you'd here the sound change perspective with it). it's as if someone gathered their friends and family (actors), took a video camera out in a cornfield for three days, put a light on top of it for the night sequences (no joke - that's what they actually did), burned through some tape, stuck the footage in their computer, cut a (very) rough version, tossed in some music, bypassed any imaginative sound work or mixing, burned it directly to dvd, and threw it on the video store shelf. any horror fan should be insulted by this type of direct to video work that is void of any skill or style. just because a person owns a video camera and is able to get somewhat of an image on tape, doesn't mean it should be released to the public. if i could give this a rating lower than a one, i would.

no. just no. that's all that needs to be said.summary: a random guy is in a cornfield. for some reason, i'm not sure, but it's his duty to run around inside. the next great thriller?a five year old could make a better movie just filming an anthill, or even just grass growing. seriously.....you can't say it has bad acting, because there is no acting. you can't say it has bad writing, because it has no writing. you can't say it has bad cinematography, because there is no cinematography. you can't say it's a bad movie, because there is no movie! if you don't believe me, go watch it. just don't say i never warned you.....

i couldn't even...i mean...look....okay...wow.not even a bunch of my drunk friends trying to make fun of the movie could enjoy themselves in the least bit.i can only think...how. how do independent film makers everywhere go years without getting noticed (or even their lives) and con-artists like the guy who made this get a dvd on a shelf? it seriously looks as if some guy with a home movie camera went out with some guys he met at subway and made the worst thing he could think of."hey guys, give me some ideas. start with a corn-field and work backwards." "well, you've gotta have actors straight out of high school, and some broken corn stalks with shreds of clothing attached. and boobs." thanks, guy, i'm sure that you and windows movie maker will be side by side on your next anxiously awaited project.

this is definitely one of the best kung fu movies in the history of cinema. the screenplay is really well done (which is not often the case for this type of movies) and you can see that chuck (in one of his first role)is a great actor. the final fight with the sherif deputy in the bullring is a masterpiece!

this is a very very boring and uninteresting action film, and without chuck norris it would have been unbearable!, plus the low budget shows big time!. some of the fights were good, but the story is laughable, and there no menacing villains at all.the dialog was laughable i had some trouble finishing this film, but chuck norris, made it somewhat bearable. i really have nothing more to say, since i was only paying half attention,because it was so incredibly boring however it did pick up a tiny bit towards the end. the direction is terrible. don hulette, does a terrible job here, with lousy photography, an awful pace, and overall the film looked dull!. there is no gore. the acting was terrible. chuck norris is very good here, he kicks that ass, and he made the film almost bearable(chuck rules!). george murdock, is terrible as the main villain, and very unconvincing. terry o'connor, is decent here, and had okay chemistry with chuck. michael augenstein, is decent as chuck's brother. overall it's quite simple avoid! * out of 5 (chuck saves it from the bomb rating).

i bought this chuck norris dvd knowing that it was one of his earliest films, and it shows. we all know that he will never win an oscar for his acting, but that's not what we watch him for. although there have been a few earthquakes in california since this movie was made, there never was any desert or hills between hwy.99 and i 5. billy was supposedly crossing over from 99 to 5 along 120, a distance of less that 15 miles. i wish that the writers, producers and directors of these movies would, at least, look at a map. as a truck driver who spends a lot of time in california, i could tell right from the start that the geography was wrong. however, there are worse ways to spend an hour and a half. so grab your doritos and an adult beverage and enjoy a trip back in time.

i work in an office on weekends, and there is a tv that only gets one channel. so, i don't have the option of turning to something better. i keep it on, though, because it provides a little background noise. sometimes, i get a decent movie/show. not today. today, i got "breaker breaker." the city looks like a third rate set (which, of course, it is). all the actors and bad guys look like they just graduated from stuntman school. i have seen better dramatic enactments at a carnival. the special effects (flames at end of movie are more fake then michael jacksons masculinity). even the horse at the end of the movie was a terrible actor... a badly acted, badly shot, badly written movie.

ever want to see a movie where chuck norris takes the bad guys aside and calmly discusses with them the errors of their ways until they see the light and, with tears in their eyes, they shake hands, right the wrongs of the world together in peace and harmony and forever end the reign of evil in the world?well, forget it, jocko. "breaker! breaker!" instead goes right for the drop-kick as our truck-drivin' man chuck steers his big rig into the small backwoods town where his little brother is being held by a corrupt judge and his even-more corrupt law-men. chuck karate kicks, chops, slices, juliennes and crinkle-cuts every baddie in sight until not an evil-doer dares raise his head. a lot of fights are in slow-motion, for excitement purposes, but just help pad out the movie to fill 86 minutes.and there's a lot of fights here, which leave just about 15 minutes for plot development...and that's about all the plot you get. but what did you expect: calm discussion?one star for "breaker! breaker!"; and that's a small 10-4, good buddy.

ok with this film there are a number of ingredients at work:first put in loads of hillbilly truckers--good ole boys who have secret desire to take law into own hands. second put in evil hillbilly cops controlled by a texas bred outlaw. third put in karate fighting trucker played by chuck norris. fourth put in a chump teenager as norris's nephew captured by evil hillbilly cops. fifth show chuck norris fighting in slow motion.now mix all together and what have you got?you guessed it...one very mediocre movie!

i caught this movie a few years ago one night, and it was one of the funniest movies i have ever seen. however, since it is supposed to be an action movie, i cannot give it more stars since the humor was unintentional.chuck norris plays a truck driver who comes home from the road to see his family, and within the first five minutes the conflict arises which leads chuck to seek vengeance for the rest of the film. good thing too, 'cuz the sub-par acting by everyone involved was starting to get old very fast. actually, the judge was pretty good, but i can't really describe what makes him work, you'll have to check it out for yourself.and the custom van chuck norris drives is hideously classic!

in terms of quality movies, this isn't one of them. it's actually the first chuck norris movie i've seen and i was left pretty underwhelmed. the fight scenes are slow and don't have a lot of variety. norris just uses a lot of roundhouse kicks on all the bad guys coming after him which makes the fights pretty boring. the movie also is quite short, but for some reason the movie doesn't even seem finished when it ends. it's a pretty anti-climatic ending. all the same though, i've watched a lot of bad movies, and this isn't one of the worst that i've seen. it's worth a watch, i'm guessing especially for norris fans. there's also nothing like seeing a group of rigs hurtling down the desert which in my opinion was the highlight of the movie.

saw this used dvd cheap, and got it for a chuckle. i had recently also found "the octagon" on dvd and bought that one to reminisce, having seen it in the theatre as a pre-teen, and loving it at the time. the problem now with "going back" to these american karate films, is that i've since then seen so many hong kong and thai action films, in which the fight scenes are long, fast and jaw-dropping. i'm thinking particularly of fights like jackie and benny "the jet" at the end of "dragons forever", or tony jaa's circular-stairwell fight from "the protector". the hollywood kung-fu offerings are just not "filmed right", and even make someone of certified skill, such as chuck, look awkward at times. and what's worse than a fight going into slow motion? then you know it looked crappy at normal speed, so they slowed it down for effect. it really highlights how ridiculous an opponent looks as they stand and just wait to get kicked in the chest.poor chuck, he just has no intensity in this film, nor does he project any righteous menace. compare that to his former co-star bruce lee, who had charm and attitude to burn. when bruce would square off against some opponent(s) you could nearly see the air around him crackling with what was about to happen. in "breaker, breaker" chuck seemed to accidentally be kicking people, with complete nonchalance. when the judge comes to see him in jail, and sentence him to death, chuck is staring off with a sad look, and i thought "ok...he's doing that 'third eye' focus thing and is going to grab the judge by the throat and get out of this", but he does nothing except look up with a doe-eyed stare. terrible. and while the dvd case gives you hope, listing a run time of 1 hour, 5 minutes, it's actually 1 hour, 25 minutes, so there's 20 more minutes of viewing pain. for great fight action, go watch jackie chan in the first "police story"....the fight in the shopping mall at the end is pure gold......

save some very early norris, "breaker, breaker" has nothing to offer which can't be found ten fold better on any broadcast channel. a pathetic attempt at film making, this is one of the worst films i have ever seen. in spite of that, i did watch it, thumbing the fast forward button, because the acting was so awful it was comical. of course, the film is supposed to be an action/drama but turned out as a treatise on how not to make a movie. everything which could be wrong with film is on screen in this "dog". if you happen across it, give it a peek. it's so bad, it's funny.

i've always been a fan of chuck norris for what he's accomplished and his movies. for while i had been meaning to watch this film, but for whatever reason didn't have chance. apparently i didn't miss much. this has to be one of chuck's worst films. so this trucker, billy dawes (augenstein) is given the chance to make his delivery, but on the way he is detoured and forced into a jerkwater town where a foolish local corrupt judge trimmings (murdock) who runs the whole town, has him arrested and phony charges brought up on him. he denies the charges and makes a run for it. the local hick cops beat him and he disappears. but now his brother jd john dawes (norris) another trucker goes looking for him. he soon finds that the town is run buy the loser judge and that his brother is nowhere to be found. not long after he begins to beat off just about everyone in town. in the meantime the female of the film calls on local truckers on a cb radio, and they all come rushing into town demolishing it. lol with there big rigs. eventually norris finds his brother and beats off more thugs.this movie was pretty bad. it actually starts off ok and you feel great when norris starts to smash some of these local corrupt cops, because there such losers. but there is virtually no story, the acting is bad, and the ending ..well it doesn't really have one. the judge has his house rammed into by a big rig and you never know what happens. does he live? norris never even gets to trash him. in the meantime norris takes on some thug cop at the end. who cares? norris also manages to take on everyone in town, gets his hand broken and shot in the side and goes on to keep fighting. come on! this movie was apparently made to cash in on the cb craze of the time, why there was one is beyond me. they barley even use the cb's in the movie. adding to this, the movie near the end seems to drag on and you wonder why it's not over yet. this movie is bad, but if you're bored and need something to watch it will pass the time. as far as norris he went on to make much better films than this. 3 out of 10.

breaker! breaker! has chuck norris as a truck driver and a karate master, talk about juggling two disparate careers. he gives a load he can't deliver to his younger brother michael augenstein and then when the young man doesn't show up, chuck goes looking for him.what young augenstein has got himself into is a speed-trap run by judge george murdock who comes from the roy bean school of jurisprudence. of course norris deals with matters in the usual chuck norris way and when he gets in trouble, the call goes out over the cb for all the truckers to come and help their good buddy. this speed-trap known as texas city has a bad reputation and the drivers are only too happy to help a pal.chuck's of course quite a bit younger and with no facial hair in this one. he's got the tight lipped look of a man who realizes the academy won't be looking at this gobbler. george murdock is overacting outrageously as the judge roy bean wannabe.this one is strictly for the fans of chuck norris.

summary: not worth the filmas an avid gone with the wind fan, i was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they had left out many important characters. luckily, the film on its own was a wonderful piece. when the book scarlett came out, i read it in hopes of following two of my favorite literary characters farther on their journey together. while the book lacks any true quality, it remains a good story, and, as long as i was able to separate it from the original, was and still is enjoyable. however, i consider the six hours i spent watching the "scarlett" miniseries to be some of the worst-spent hours of my life. discrediting any of the original character traits so well-formed in margaret mitchell's book, this series also turned the story of the sequel into one of rape, mistrust, murder, and misformed relationships that even the book scarlett stayed away from. the casting for many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so well-formed in both the original novel and film, and even carried through in the second book, and again leaves out at least one incredibly crucial character. in the novel, scarlett o'hara butler follows her estranged husband rhett butler to charleston under the guise of visiting extended family. after coming to an "arrangement" with rhett, she agrees to leave, and proceeds to reconnect with her o'hara relatives in savannah. eventually, she accompanies her cousin colum, a passionate leader of the fenian brotherhood, to ireland, to further explore her family's "roots that go deep," and is eventually named "the o'hara," the head of the family. while her duties as the o'hara keep her engaged in her town of ballyhara, scarlett ventures out into the world of the english landowners, and instantly becomes a sought-after guest at many of their parties. she, having been scorned by rhett time and time again, eventually agrees to marry luke, the earl of fenton, until rhett comes along in a clichéd "night-on-white-horse" - type of a rescue. the "scarlett" miniseries fails even to do this justice. raped by her fiancé and scorned by her family, the series shows scarlett thrown in jail after she is blamed for a murder her cousin committed.i heartily advise anyone considering spending their day watching this to rethink this decision.

this movie was nothing like the book. i think the writer of the screenplay must have wanted the job of writing the sequel to gone with the wind and been turned down. this was his or her way of getting their ideas in anyway. the only similarity between this movie and the story it was portraying was the names of the principle characters and the location of the main action. none of the events that are shown in the movie happened that way in the book. for a gone with the wind fan (of both the book and the movie) this was deeply disappointing. if you loved the book scarlett, don't watch this movie hoping to see it played out on the screen. they only share the title in common.

margaret mitchell spins in her grave every time somebody watches this mess! fine costuming and sets can't even begin to overwhelm lackluster performances by joanne whalley (as the title character) and the ever-bland timothy dalton (as rhett). even worse than the acting--and perhaps partially explaining it--is the script, which is astoundingly cliched and predictable. add to that hellishly bad script a score that'll have you cringing, and you've got a disaster i wouldn't wish on any viewer. scarlett is just amazingly lousy, and i can't imagine how it ever got made, much less made it to video.

alexandra ripley wrote a horrible sequel to margaret mitchell's masterpiece book published in the 1930's. margaret mitchell's heirs sold out their rights and for big bucks allowed alexandra ripley to write a piece of junk book even worse than barbara cortland romance novels. i was a huge fan of margaret mitchells book and the fake sequel by alexandra ripley was written just to cash in for money.although i always admired the acting talent of joanne kilmer and timothy dalton, this is a really terrible film. the script is horrible and full of clichés. ann margarets cameo as belle watling is so awful i wanted to slap her.the only worthwhile thing in the movie is sean bean who gives a masterful bravura performance as the sexy, feral villain - lord fenton. sean bean's performance is along the lines of "the man you love to hate" and portrays an unsafe sex symbol.but sean bean is only in the first half of the movie so you then have to be tormented with watching an incredibly long 6 hour movie with an insufferably boring script.don't waste your money on this film, unless you are a hard core sean bean fan and just watch it for his wonderful performance.

the main character, pharaon, has suffered a loss of his wife and child in the pre-film past. he deals with with by just shutting down emotionally. too long a movie, too much time spent on pharaon's inexpressive face, too much "road time" (one of the banes of tv: filling time with moving cars, trains, etc.) long scenes of him doing trivial - sometimes totally inexplicable, nonsensically trivial - actions with neither reason or emotion. his best friends joseph and domino are not much more, their relationship based on sex (this film perhaps gives new meaning to the phrase "gratuitous sex"); domino and pharaon's mother are the two characters who display some emotion, but not much. it is hard to tell with all the characters in this movie: is it indifferent acting, indifferent writing, or simply indifferent characters portrayed by good writing and good acting. characters in this film talk very little to anyone; it's little wonder their emotionally isolated, which is all the more bizarre because it's clear they live in a neighborhood where the people are friendly and know each other.

a trio sit at a restaurant table and stare wordlessly into space. later, they lean on a rail and stare across the channel at england. a man works a hoe repetitively in his garden, only his head and upper torso visible on the screen. a man and a woman watch another man peeing against a stone wall. each of these silent shots lasts for roughly one full minute. absolutely no information is imparted that could not be given to us in about one quarter of the time. the editor must have been half asleep. i know i was.the movie open with a startling shot of the raw vagina of an obviously dead body. one's gorge rises. but then the policeman (schotte) exchanges a few words with a neighboring couple and begins to tag along after them and the case is forgotten for the next half hour while schotte and his friends trade unfunny insults with each other and with strangers. eventually the thread of the case is picked up again but proceeds slowly, almost aimlessly, following the stylistic pattern already established.sometimes in movies like this, the location shooting provides a kind of atmosphere that compensates for the dullness of the story, but not here. the houses of the french village are attached to one another in long rows. the house fronts abut the pavement directly, with no steps. the fronts show virtually no decoration and are pretty much indistinguishable. the flat farmlands are featureless. what might have been one of the more interesting episodes -- a visit to a stone fort on the coast -- bores the trio until they begin behaving like snots and are asked to leave.the acting is minimal. nobody seems particularly anxious to say anything. no jokes are made. nothing amusing happens. the policeman has a face almost as interesting as randy quaid's. the babe, a tall hefty blonde, looks like the kind of shot putter on steroids that the east germans used to field at the olympic games.i sat through more than an hour of it before giving it up. maybe i'll take a crack at it some other time. unless i've missed something or unless it turns into some deranged monty python routine towards the end, i don't think you'll get much out of renting it.

i saw this film at the edinburgh film festival, and would not recommend it. it is two and a half hours long, during which nothing much happens at a wading-through-porridge pace.the main characters are gormless and totally lacking in charisma or personality. no-one smiles at all during the film (neither would i if i had their lives), and although domino seems to have a healthy sexual appetite she doesn't seem to enjoy sex at all.the whole experience is depressing and ponderous, the director lingering over each scene in a way that drove me crazy rather than striking me with the beauty of his technique.too many questions were left in my mind: why does he sniff the algerian man's head? why does he levitate? what is he looking at over the allotment fence? why does he kiss joseph? why did we go and see this rubbish rather than ordering another bottle of wine in bouzy rouge?

to call this film a disaster will be an understatement. i don't even know where to begin! i have questions though, and lots of them. i would like to know who conceived of this script? who gave them money to make this film? who was in charge of casting and costuming? they should all be sued! i saw this film in my local library's catalog and i thought "hey! great!" i had just seen the two fog movies that hollywood had produced and then realised that bollywood had a version. unbeknowst to me, that it would turn out to be a total and utter crap-fest! dhund - the fog, is a film about four friends (actually just one of them but you should know that there are four friends), one of them is a beauty queen (played by india's 1st mrs. world, aditi govitrikar) and the director spares no expense at letting you know this. the script even claims that she (the character's name is simran) has aishwarya rai eyes, kareena kapoor lips and rani mukherjee hair. feel free to barf if you want to, at least at this point you haven't seen the film, unlike poor me. :*(anyway, simran receives a death threat one day from one of the contestants' uncle, who tells her to drop out of the contest so that his niece would have a better chance of winning, but simran's boyfriend doesn't allow her to do this and thus she participates in the pageant and wins. this causes the crack-cocaine-sniffing uncle of her former college classmate tanya to come after her. but with the help of her cousin kajal, simran drowns the culprit and they enlist both their boyfriends in the task of getting rid of the body. it's tough but they eventually get around to doing it.in a scene that borrows from hollywood's film diabolique, the pool where the dead body is hidden is drained only to reveal that the body is missing and this begins a conundrum of whodunit and where-is-it? by the time the film is over, the film successful steals scenes from 'i know what you did last summer, i still know, scream 1, scream 2, scream 3, murder she wrote episodes and not to mention, columbo and scooby doo'! shameless, i tell ya!inconsistencies and problems within the film include but are not limited to: 1. a scantily clad simran answers phone-calls three times from her would-be-killer, the camera shows her drop the phone off the hook yet the phone is able to ring again each time and she picks it up to answer. 2. tanya tries to kill herself because she doesn't win the beauty contest? wtf? even aishwarya rai who is ten time more beautiful did not attempt suicide when she didn't win miss india!3. in the pool scene, the kids who come to retrieve the ball that has fallen into the pool conveniently disappear as soon as the police arrive. and the ball disappears too. 4. the cliché blue contacts lenses of the killer change from blue to brown in the drowning scene, yet when his corpse surfaces again, his eyes are blue. 5. nobody who dies in the film is mourned (strange, especially for indian society).6. when vikram jumps into the dirty murky pool, an underwater camera shows us his actions and miraculously the pool is transformed to olympic size and is clean and clear as day. 7. sexy belly-dancer performs a pseudo-orgasm drenched song and dance number about coming of age. that would have been cool for some bachelor party, but they were celebrating simran's pageant win! hello!!!! 8. kunal, sameer, simran and kajal can neither dance nor lip synch properly. but don't blame them, just accept that there was no choreographer for the dance numbers.9. nothing within the film was choreographed, it was like they just told the actors to show up and do whatever the want. 10. the film played out like there was no script. either that or the director was high and drunk when filming this junk!11. when simran's picture was published without her consent in a magazine, she flew to the police headquarters to have the photographers arrested, yet she receives death threats and never bothers to alert the police.just to mention a few of course. this film was a painful experience for me and i advise everyone to skip it by all means necessary and possible. bollywood should be terribly ashamed of this kind of film-making.

just to save you money and time i will go ahead and tell you that this movie is absolutely not worth the match and gas it would take to burn it. don't waste your time. as a matter-of-fact you would be better off forgetting you ever thought about watching it. i have seriously seen better b movies in a language that i can't understand. who ever gave permission for this to be made needs to be sewed. the only positive thing i can say for this movie is that with a new script and the right director and actors it could be a great story. let me break it down; a virgin gets pregnant by a demon, the baby while inside her womb wants to feed on people. they try to make up for the fact that this is possibly the worst movie ever made with cursing and pointless nudity. all in all totally not worth the dollar it took me to rent it.

i just watched that movie, and was pretty disappointed. i didn't expect much to begin with as the premise of the movie doesn't suggest greatness anyway. sadly, it doesn't even manage to deliver just as stupid entertainment. the main problem is probably the acting. while i've seen far worse actors in far worse movies, the story would require some people to act out as violent maniacs, some others as people caught a in really stressing predicament, and they fail to deliver that. although i watched the german release i watched with the original audio, so it's definitely not just bad voice-overs or anything like that. added to that, the german dvd release seems to be cut, the killings are all pretty much left out, meaning that except for a few semi-gory scenes closer to the end the german release doesn't deliver as a movie for "gore-hounds", either. can't comment on that for other releases of course. the plot has some stupid moments thrown in here and there and the beginning is just hilarious (ever heard of a demon visiting a psychiatrist?). too bad the movie takes itself far too seriously, if it was filmed as a horror-comedy and changed a bit here and there accordingly it might have worked better. the ending is just a huge disappointment.if you've got really nothing better to do and just can't stand the boredom anymore you might (and it's really a weak "might") consider this movie. if there's anything else available to watch or do: pick that alternative.

a man comes to the office of the psychiatric dr. sammael (joan severance) claiming to be the demon asmodeus (kane hodder), the torturer of the 13th level of the hell, and he would like to tell weird things. he tells that he had made a deal with lucifer to become human again. he should knock-up his virgin sister mary elizabeth (alison brie) on the day that their mother died and she should kill six people and deliver the anti-christ, and then he would escape from the pit and reborn. when mary elizabeth gets pregnant, her stressed and abusive sister catherine (denise crosby) does not believe that she is virgin, but their father and former obstetrician albert martino (james callahan) examines his daughter and sees her intact hymen. meanwhile the church discovers the truth about mary elizabeth's pregnancy and sends the priest and former military father anthony (eddie velez) to spy mary elizabeth. she is dominated by the fetus and forced to kill a truck driver, lars (jorg sirtl), who is the lover of her tenant and friend jennifer (azalea davila), and jennifer herself and eat their hearts and drink their bloods, but she believes that she has nightmares. however during the ultrasound, she realizes that she is carrying a monster and she asks her father to stop her pregnancy. but it is too late.the awful "born" is a b-movie (actually a z-movie) that believes that is a great movie. the result is a pretentious and disappointing production, with an incoherent and absurd story without humor and terrible acting and direction. the plot is a complete mess: there is a priest that is a hit-man and former soldier; a demon in existential crisis going to a psychiatric; a father that examines the virginity of his daughter; two female-demons (succubus?) that stand naked like a statue with both hands covering their sexes; a character that is a slut, and only exists to expose her beautiful body. there are many scenes with free and cheap nudity. but the worst is the acting: the unknown lead actress alison brie is histrionic, with ridiculous voices and grimaces. sorry, ms. alison brie, but i hated your annoying performance. i have not recognized joan severance, who has a good performance, since i still had the image of her youth. denise crosby performs a hateful character and like everybody, she got older but she is still a good actress. i believe that if the writer and the director had included some dark humor and assumed that this movie is a b-movie, the story might have worked better and better. my vote is three.title (brazil): "o anti-cristo" ("the anti-christ")

this must rank as one of cinema's greatest debacles. i was wandering europe at the time and had the misfortune to stumble upon the crew making this movie in what was, even then, one of the world's idyllic, unspoiled settings. i was enlisted as an extra, and what followed was an exhibition of modern day debauchery. forget all the accusations you've ever heard of peter mayall's intrusions on this rare piece of french life- geoff reeve and his cohorts embarked on a level of revelry at the restaurant at les beaux that left the maitre'd slack-jawed in disbelief. they were, quite simply, awful, uncultured and undeserving of french hospitality.

it's weird, this film; you get the impression that the makers of this snooze-fest spent more time in the local bars than on set. in fact, it's a surprise not to see harry alan towers' name on the credits; it certainly has the flavour of one of his tax-shelter productions but here the motivation behind the project seems to be for all involved to enjoy a prolonged stay in provence. despite the fact that the film is supposed to take place all over the region, les baux and the area around it stands in for almost everything.david birney makes for a spectacularly colourless hero - as michael lonsdale says at one point "you're a walking cliché". what lonsdale is doing in this is anyone's guess. for some reason, the most interesting character, played by rampling, is sidelined, whereas, regardless of the book, she should have been the central figure because she clearly has the skill to carry the movie (which would have been dull anyway, but at least we'd have got more of something pretty to look at).all in all a pointless affair that is only worth watching to see how action-less an action movie can be.

a lot of alistair maclean's books have made it onto the big screen. some of them (the guns of navarone, fear is the key, where eagles dare) have been translated rather well; some (breakheart pass, ice station zebra, the secret ways) have been passable enough; a few (river of death, bear island, the way to dusty death) have been pretty rotten. caravan to vaccares is another movie based on one of maclean's perennially popular bestsellers, but alas this is yet another that deserves adding to the "rotten" list. peopled by uninteresting characters who get into uninteresting situations and escapades, caravan to vaccares is an absolute failure, both as a thriller and an entertainment. its only semi-redeeming qualities are: a) that it is filmed on very attractive provence locations, and: b) charlotte rampling looks utterly ravishing (with fully nude scenes to boot) as the main female character.disillusioned american drifter neil bowman (david birney) is travelling aimlessly through france when he meets british photographer lila (charlotte rampling). they decide to accompany each other, and during their wanderings make the acquaintance of mysterious nobleman duc de croyter (michel lonsdale). the duc persuades the pair to aid him in protecting and escorting hungarian scientist zuger (michael bryant), who is sought by various shady parties because of some information that he is carrying in his head. kept secret from bowman and lila is the fact that zuger has discovered a secret formula for using solar power as cheap, economical energy. the hungarian needs desperately to get his formula to new york, but hired guns have been put on his trail to capture him  presumably so that he can be taken back to some ruthless criminal lord and tortured into revealing his priceless secret, which they can then sell on to the highest bidder. bowman and lila find themselves and their terrified fugitive on the run in the french countryside from their deadly adversaries.the film seems terribly cheap and amateurish, almost like an ultra low-budget independent film made by a non-professional cast and crew. yet a fair sum of money was actually thrown at the film, and all those involved have, at various points in their careers, done much better work. therefore, one has to assume that the film is bad simply because it has been written, acted and directed with a distinct lack of care and interest. the pacing is deadly slow, and the plot points become so laborious that the viewer has to put in too much unrewarded effort to keep up with the story. birney's performance is uninvolving, and rampling only creates a stir due to her nude scenes  the character itself is an absolute bore, and the actress looks rightly bored by it. for those who manage to stick with the film right to the very end, there is an unusual scene featuring some deadly rodeo clowns and a fierce bull (!) which, while not particularly exciting or well executed, is at least different to the norm. caravan to vaccares is a very disappointing film in most respects, and once more a strong novel by the prolific author has suffered during its transition onto the screen.

the ending made my heart jump up into my throat. i proceeded to leave the movie theater a little jittery. after all, it was nearly midnight. the movie was better than i expected. i don't know why it didn't last very long in the theaters or make as much money as anticipated. definitely would recommend 

this is a treat for fans of z-grade movies. here you will find writing and acting bad enough to rival anything ed wood ever produced. veteran bad movie actor cameron mitchell is a former makeup man from "paragon studios" who, after a nasty acid-in-the-face incident at a social gathering, becomes an embittered mad scientist (tm) with a rubber scar on his face who takes revenge by kidnapping paragon actors and turning them into living statues in his secret laboratory (tm) handily located in the local wax museum. or are they zombies who do his bidding? he's not sure. happily, many of your favourite movie clichés are here. check out the villain's lab! are those mysterious steaming vats of liquid? test tubes of coloured water with no explained purpose? yay! and what ho, do we see spare arms and legs arranged kinda casual-like on a wooden rack? you betcha! marvel at the bumbling detectives acting with straight out of plan nine! now, enjoy a stupidly tame car chase, and hear more dizzy bimbo screaming than you could possibly want. raise an eyebrow at the screwy plot line, made even more opaque by the totally meaningless ending that seems to have no connection to the rest of the movie. cheesy trash and much fun for the bad movie connoisseur.

definitely not a good film but nowhere as bad as some would paint it to be. nightmare in wax tells the story of a man, having had his face disfigured in a typical flashback scene, wreak his vengeance on those directly responsible and those indirectly for the losses in his life - most notably the love and companionship of a beautiful young actress. cameron mitchell plays the artist with his typical flair, albeit limited flair. actually, i thought he gave one of his better performances. what exactly does that mean? mitchell wears an eye patch, endlessly smokes cigarettes, wears a motley tunic, and talks to his creations in wax. they are not your ordinary wax dummies, but rather people still alive controlled by some serum that makes them lose control of all neurological function. they become zombies in effect. i thought the premise here was inventive if nothing else. it has some ludicrous explanation, but does serve the plot. this is a film of the 60s to be sure with some psychedelic camera-work by bud townsend and company. the acting is mediocre but mitchell, scott brady, and barry kroeger give interesting turns. the wax figures of hollywood's bygone era are done very effectively and most of the location shooting was very credible. the end of the film dissipates into something not quite real - either another example of 60s cultural cinema or the end of the scriptwriter's creativity. i'm banking on the latter. despite its many flaws, i enjoyed the film. the opening scene showing an actor being needled was effectively done as was a police chase on the waterfront.

along with his turn in the super-sleazy 'classic' the toolbox murders (1978), this is considered the ultimate bad cameron mitchell horror effort. it's a little too slow-moving for my tastes, has zero likable characters in it and not much action until the very end, but mitchell's dedicated central psycho performance as vengeance-minded whack-job vincent rinard is fun. not anthony perkins good, mind you, but definitely fun enough. as a spoof of the shallow conceit that is hollywood, it's only so-so; as a horror movie it's also only fair. and even as just a simple vintage exploitation picture, it's just ok. i'm a big fan of the unnecessary gratuitous dance sequence, so i was also thankful for the appearance of the gazzarri dancers, who just rule. five of them do a crazy hair-thrashin', floor-slidin', hip-shaking' go-go dance routine to "don't cry, look for the rainbow" by the t-bones. watching these ladies bounce around with huge smiles on their faces in their fringe-covered bikini top and parachute pants ensemble is a defining reason why i give this a slightly higher rating that usual.former movie make-up man vincent rinard ("the best since lon chaney!") goes after people at paragon studios. a flashback shows how max black (berry kroeger), a jealous and drunk studio executive, flung wine in vinnie's face right when he was about to light a smoke. he's engulfed in flames and dives into a pool, but not before scarring up one side of his face and losing an eyeball (not to mention his sanity). now employed by the "world-famous" movieland wax museum in buena park, california, vincent uses a special serum (described as a mixture of truth serum, nerve medicine and special "vitamins and minerals"... watch out centrum!) to paralyze victims. they disappear and the dense detectives on the case (headed by scott brady) act baffled as new 'statues' are put on display in the museum. vince talks to himself ("i'm a terribly nice man!"), chain-smokes, mumbles, hisses and describes how he gets "excited" by the sound of a woman's scream.he also has to deal with a bunch of back-stabbing scumbags and self-absorbed witches, most of whom will deserve what's coming to them. there is also nick (hollis morrison), a boozy, inept museum tour guide who sees a 'statue' blink, but doesn't go to the cops. aside from max (a real grade-a jerk... who doesn't even die!) and the stupid cops, the other two lead roles are women and both are pretty atrocious. marie morgan (anne helm) is not your typical innocent heroine; this tramp has been engaged to no less that five different characters in this movie (!), including vince, max and two of the wax dummies/missing male stars (i guess she never had time to make a go at the one missing girl). for some reason, she also begs and pleads in her irritating baby-voice for vince to give her a 'replica' of the head he's designing of the newest missing actor (and fiancé number 5) tony deen (phillip baird). she doesn't know that vince has already jabbed a syringe in the back of his neck, but i love it when mitchell dryly agrees with her demands "so you can completely retreat for reality." he also wants her to 'pose' for him, which means she's eventually held prisoner in a box. unfortunately, the box has a hole where her head sticks through so we have to continue getting aurally assaulted by her high-pitched whines.the other "woman" is theresa (victoria carroll), one of the aforementioned go-go girls. she's first seen proving she is thoroughly rhythm-deficient by jiggling on stage in a lime-green fringe bikini. theresa is tolerable before she talks, but when you realize her grating presence combines the abrasiveness of lorraine bracco with the airhead mentality of the landers sisters, you wish vincent would inject her with the serum as soon as possible. unfortunately, we're first subjected to a scene of her making endless demands to the studio head honcho and running around in the museum trying to avoid mitchell. she and the rest of the characters are completely unsympathetic, but function as a way to poke fun at the hollywood system in general, i guess. and i'm probably giving this movie more credit than it actually deserves. the pluses are few and far between, but include (other than mitchell and the dance routine), colorful, slightly stylized lighting and a bizarre ending that seems to suggest that rinard will be severely punished for his crimes by spending the rest of his life in his own personal hell... married to marie!... yikes, now that is scary.also in the cast are director john "bud" cardos (also the production manager) as a police sergeant, james forrest as a film director, virgil frye as a statue, rini martin and kent osborne as a bartender. many of the people who worked on this one (including executive producer and script-writer rex carlton) also worked on the al adamson movie blood of dracula's castle and other atrocities.my score: 4 out of 10

the word "boring" gets thrown around way too often when referring to exactly how bad a low-budget horror movie might, or might not be. i've seen many a b-movie. many horrible, terribly inept b-movies. some with a production value of a few hundred bucks. does ineptness, lousy acting, worse continuity, and embarrassing budgets really make a movie unwatchable? some would no doubt way yes. most of which are probably huge fans of the matrix. well, i hate big-budget movies, so i say no. bad can sometimes be funny (blood freak), sometimes even mind-blowing (troll 2), but boring will always be unwatchable... hey, kinda like bloodthirsty butchers, which reminds me, i'm writing a review for this pile of garbage... uh, yeah, anyway. this is one of late british director andy milligan's many alternatives to sleeping pills. this one is based on sweeney todd... great. milligan takes a boring story, and still manages to "butcher" it. hey, that's pretty funny, i said bu... sorry, i keep getting distracted. this isn't exactly easy. on second thought, i'll make it easy. no gore, no scares, no entertainment, just unlikeable, annoying people having incoherent conversations. that's bloodthirsty butchers. oh yeah, and something about a barber killing people, and something or other about meat pies. i don't know, it's not important.for something a little more rewarding from andy milligan, there's always the only other one i've seen, the rats are coming, the werewolves are here. yeah, you heard me. but hows about we forget about this milligan guy all together, and pick up something sweet like sick girl or teenape goes to camp. whatever you decide, just know, bloodthirsty butchers sucks, possibly even more than any other version of this already lackluster tale. and that, b-movie fans, is really saying something. 2/10

when i bought this film, i expected to get a fun, 1970's exploitation film. instead, i got this bore fest by amateur auteur andy milligan. ah, andy milligan. with his tight editing, breakneck pacing , and wonderfully well known actors, you'd almost think you're watching...one of his home movies! seriously, i couldn't even stay awake the first time i tried to watch it. the scenes of boring people dragged on an on, and whenever someone got killed, the film would slow down. sometimes it would speed up too, making the characters voices sound like chipmunks, which was probably the best thing about this film. the script actually seemed a bit better than the film, and seems more well suited to be in a soap opera than in a grainy 70's sleeping pill where the actors constantly stumble over it's lines. the cover said "their prime cuts were curiously erotic...but thoroughly brutal!" trust me, there is nothing "erotic" about this film. oh, we do get to see characters that resemble extra lumpy cottage cheese making out, but that's about it. and as far as "brutal", well, the viewer is brutalized the most with this here film. and another thing...

you know the story of "sweeney todd" now, most likely thanks to tim burton's recent movie. you probably don't know it though, from this take on the old tale from andy milligan-that notorious sleaze merchant that gave al adamson and ted v. mikels a run for their money.it had to happen eventually. in my years of watching horror and exploitation from the 60's to the 80's, i'm finally reviewing an andy milligan movie. you see, from 1964 to 1990, andy gave us many an exploitation and horror movie-none of which was any good, and barely watchable. "the bloodthirsty butchers" is no exception.there is dialog and well, there is talk, and that's one of the things you will find here-lots and lots of talk. the movie reaches almost "manos the hands of fate" levels at times, as you wait tirelessly for something to happen. while i love cheap looking gore effects, the violence is too few and far between, and in spite of it's reputation, the "breast" scene isn't that shocking. i love cheap and sleazy exploitation as much as the next trash cinema devotee, but "bloodthirsty butchers" is the kind of bad that mst3k would tear apart mercilessly. sadly, milligan would die of aids in 1991, and if there is any movie of his i'd say i sort of like, it would be the delirious "the ghastly ones." this is no "ghastly ones" though-it's just bad.

this film was a mexican made horror film from the late 60s. it's not that good, but really not so bad either. there is plenty of schlock and it is padded pretty heavily with nudity and violence, but it had a plot and at least tried to keep to it (even if the plot was the same damn frankenstein inspired "don't tamper in god's domain" b-movie fare). there was some padding mixed in with the female wrestling, but it was made in mexico and wrestling does seem to be popular in mexico.the plot is that a doctor wants to save his son, who is dying from leukemia. the other doctors have given no hope for the poor guy, but dad has the idea of transplanting a gorilla's heart for his son's to save his life (i don't know, i'm a lawyer not a doctor). the transplant works, but sonny-boy ends up becoming a man-ape who terrorizes nude women and kills anyone who gets in his path. there's also a subplot involving a cop and his girlfriend who is a wrestler (this really didn't add too much, but if they wanted to throw in some masked female wrestlers here's a good reason to do so).the film was kind of cheap, but not too bad for a b-movie of the day. the plot was basically just recycled and there were a few things that weren't tied in that well. however, this film is kind of fun in its own way (i don't know why, maybe because it's a mexican horror film and sticks out in my normal bad movie diet). i guess it may be because it's a mix and mash of some very weird things.watch it if you like cheesy foreign films, nudity, and female wrestlers.

the following "review" is one from the wrong side of the tracks, meaning two things: you will hear nothing but praises coming from me and don't be fooled by my rating. i also could tell you that this review contains no spoilers, but technically... that's a lie.well,... screw the review. i'm just going to ramble a bit. it has been a while since i had so much fun with such a bad film. and if you cannot enjoy this piece of utter drivel, then you simply have no sense of humor. first off, this movie was meant to be taken seriously, and that's the main aspect were the fun is coming from. the story? a doctor's son is terminally ill. daddy-doctor decides that a hart-transplant must be the only way of saving his son. so, in true mad-doctor-style, he decides that the heart of a gorilla will do the trick. of course, the gorilla-heart is "much too potent for a human", so sonny-boy transforms into this hideous ape-man that immediately breaks free and goes on a killing and raping spree (because that's simply what any horny beast would do, isn't it?). the make-up of our ape-man is hilarious. there's simply no other way of putting it: the guys' face looks like a turd! i'm talking human excrement here, the solid brown kind! beautiful! the gore in this flick is wonderful too: aside from real footage of an open-heart surgery, we also have incredibly fake (but quite nasty) looking blood & gore effects: a decapitation, an eye-gouging, a throat-ripping, the scalping of someone's skull,... it's hilarious, and indeed it's quite incomprehensible why night of the bloody apes ever made it to the notorious uk video-nasties list, because all of the nasty things portrayed in this film are simply too ridiculous to be taken seriously. oh, and there's only one bloody ape running around in it too, by the way. so, needless to say that la horripilante bestia humana is a much more accurate title for this terrifying and convincing tale of science gone horribly wrong.when not trying to shock with poorly staged acts of bloody violence or random portrayals of female nudity, this movie manages to be highly entertaining with ingredients like nonsensical dialogues, cheap cardboard sets, plot stupidity and incredibly bad acting. just a few random examples, maybe? about the sets: one can clearly see that the set-designers just used the same walls, doors, windows (etc.) over and over again to be build various different interior sets (e.g.: one side of the hospital room - the window side - where the unconscious wrestling girl lies, looks suspiciously similar like the window side of the basement-laboratory from where ape-man escapes; the set-designers also took one of the side-windows from the laboratory, made it a bit larger and just placed it in the conference-room of the hospital; all the walls in any building are the same grey-ones;...). then there's the setting of the park. clearly shot in a studio, you can see (on several occasions) that the grass is loose. whenever there's some struggling/fighting/raping going on, the grass just shifts and shuffles and you can see the grey concrete from the studio-floor beneath it.just a few random lines that come out the actors' mouths: -- in the conference-room where all the doctors are debating the disappearance of unconscious wrestling girl (a disappearance that would of course mean bad publicity for the hospital), daddy-doctor intelligently utters "we find ourselves in a situation that is difficult".-- during that same debate a colleague-doctor cleverly remarks "a sleepwalker! any sleepwalker gets up.", hereby providing a solid excuse for the disappearance of unconscious wrestling girl.-- after our investigating detective, through the amazing process of his own logical deduction, concludes and tells his superior that the murderer must be a half man/half beast, his superior answers that it's absurd, adding the line "it's more probable that of late, more and more, you're watching on your television many of those pictures of terror"... truly one of the best lines of the movie.other sources of laughter: -- the two scenes were daddy-doctor and his igor-like assistant kidnap the gorilla from the zoo and unconscious wrestling girl from the hospital - these well thought-out acts of abduction are like taking candy from a baby.-- daddy-doctor speaks to god a lot, doesn't he?-- sonny-boy calling daddy-doctor "papa" on more than one occasion.-- an old lady screaming "aaargh!!! a dead man! a dead man! a dead man!! a dead man!!!".-- the plot periodically stops to wallow in scenes of women wrestling, only to go on again and do nothing with that concept. sure, daddy-doctor replaces sonny-boy's gorilla-heart a second time with that of unconscious wrestling girl, but do you think something spectacular happens after that? like ape-turd-man growing breasts or something, trying to rape men this time? our leading living wrestling beauty (norma lazareno) doesn't even go into a climactic wrestling contest with ape-turd-man near the movie's finale... but ape-turd-man does start to show some motherly love near the end... almost (and i say "almost") in true king kong-style (i.e. the top of a building and people on the ground pointing and screaming).okay, i think that's enough now. i chipped in more than my two cents here. vomitron's rational rating for this sleazy piece of hilarious dreck: 2/10. vomitron's rating from the wrong side of the tracks: 8/10. go see this film, people. it is well worth it!

this is another notorious mexican horror film: however, while the original spanish-language version is quite tame, all sorts of gore and nudity were inserted for the english-dubbed variant (prepared by jerald intrator - who did similar duties on the curious dr. humpp [1967/71] - and, like the u.s. version of that film, had previously been available on dvd through something weird/image)! i watched the original first and, while no great shakes, it was fairly engaging - especially with a plot as familiar as this one was: a doctor goes beyond the call of duty in attempting to save the life of his terminally ill son; he even has a hulking, game-legged assistant (played by carlos lopez moctezuma, who had essayed a strikingly similar role - though in a more sinister vein - in the curse of the crying woman [1961]). i know that several mexican films mingled horror with the "lucha libre" (wrestling) genre but i had never watched one myself; this element is present here - in fact, the heroine is a wrestler - but the two styles are, perhaps thankfully, kept apart (that said, the wrestling sequences are competently done, with some of the moves proving highly amusing).the doctor's son is transformed into a monster (looking like the incredible hulk with mud splashed over his face!) after having had an ape's heart transplanted into him - but, then, when this is replaced with that of a comatose female wrestler, he stays this way and grows a pair of fangs to boot (shouldn't he realistically have turned into a transsexual...though i guess that wouldn't have been very interesting)!! the climactic rooftop sequence in which the monster kidnaps a child and meets his demise at the hands of the police is reminiscent of the ghost of frankenstein (1942). my favorite unintentionally funny moments in the film, however, occur when the doctor, trying to comfort his son, tells him that he'll soon be cured - only to turn his back soon after on the verge of tears - and also the impatient look he gives his crippled assistant (as the latter staggers slowly into the car) when they're about to chase the monster who has escaped from the lab.the alternate nude scenes work for the film (these were actually done by cardona himself for a racier mexican version entitled horror y sexo) but its reputation is largely based on the added material showing over-the-top violence, such as an eyeball being gouged out of its socket, a scalping and even a person's head being torn off. there are also several graphic operation inserts which, however, give rise to a goof: while it's made clear that only two people are involved in the operation, we see a third pair of hands constantly holding an oxygen mask to the patient's face! the film is also said to be a loose remake of cardona's own black-and-white horror film doctor of doom (1962) but, since i haven't watched that one, i can't say how much of it was actually pilfered for night of the bloody apes...

oh, how i laughed during those first couple of scenes. this silly little film about an 11 year-old who carries a gun, steals cars, robs stores, burglars houses, extorts money from other kids, burns houses, shoots rats, buys drugs, distributes drugs to his mother and his friends, and then kills a guy. what a great comedy! but it wasn't intended to be a comedy. it was intended as a social drama. how can this be? the events in this film are absurd and ridiculous. the characters are all stereotypes right out of a 4 year-old's comic-strip-induced immature imagination. the dialog is laughable; people talk like morons. it's a very dumb film.the first scenes are indeed very funny, for all the wrong reasons. but the unintentional hilarity of the idiotic premise runs out after a short while, and after that the laughs come only rarely; by that time the viewer can't believe what he is seeing and is alternately amazed and bored by what follows (if he has at least half a brain cell).a short film, but feels like an eternity. the film actually is a seriously-intended attempt to show the world of a young degenerate, while imitating movies vastly superior to it, like "fun". there is just such an air of phoniness about everything; the kids, the adults, everyone lacks credibility both in their actions and dialog. the kid in the lead mugs his way through the film as though he had seen all the jimmy cagney movies at least a hundred times. and, typically enough, the kid isn't portrayed as a reservoir of evil, but, instead, as a misunderstood little artistic talent. but of course. every young hooligan is misunderstood - society made him bad. poor child.the film is embarrassing; a collection of stale, occasionally hilarious clichés put together to make a movie that lacks intelligence and meaning. the intellectual level of the film is zero.

this is not the true story. it is the darkest possible fiction derived from the events. it endorses suicide, morose obsession with death, a totally gratuitous sideswipe at organized religion in general (and the anglican church, in particular) and generally provides a nihilistic, pointless world view from which filmgoers, i suppose, are intended to walk away, richer in their poverty and more hopeful in their hopelessness.utter trash, though attractively performed by a capable cast. that anyone would suggest this is a true rendering, however, is very much false advertising. you want the real story? rent 'fairy tale'. that's the real story. see if you can find any correspondence between the facts presented in either case. i only found one: the girls who made the original photographs were pre-pubescent.

against my own better judgment i went to see this film today, and god i wish i hadn't. awful. the first avp film looks like a classic compared to this, it's that bad. these guys actually make paul ws anderson look like a master storyteller. in fact, this is what i'd expect an alien and/or predator film to look like if it was made by uwe boll! this movie actually offended me, and lord only knows what would transpire if ridley scott or hr giger were ever forced to watch this piece of crap. i can't understand how any fan of either franchise could like this film.truly i don't know where to begin. i mean, the first avp was poop, but it at least a semi-interesting story and setting, and occasionally some genuine tension. it didn't take itself overly seriously and it could at least be semi enjoyed on a purely "leave your brain at home" basis. but this one, it felt to me as though the people behind it thought they were making the next horror masterpiece. one after the other was a contrived 'suspenseful' scene in a dark room or corridor with creepy music playing, essentially bashing you over the head saying "be scared now". as james cameron once said, you can't be told to be scared, you can only have your own senses heightened. the guys that made this film obviously weren't paying attention because they tried everything in the book to force you to be scared rather than letting you come to that level yourself. it's a cliché for internet nerds to say "god, i was so bored from this movie and felt like leaving", well this is exactly how i felt, even in the middle of the action scenes. they took this film totally seriously, which removed any possibility of enjoyment. even the gag about how governments don't lie to their people was played without a hint of irony.as for the characters, i knew going in that the human characters were going to be completely pointless to this film but seriously if they're going to be on-screen at least have them doing something that is relevant to the story. i don't care about this guy being beaten up by his dreamgirl's boyfriend, i don't care about the mother who's "own daughter doesn't even know her, boo-hoo!" (a pair of night-vision goggles for a present? give me a break!) or the released criminal just trying to make a decent living and set an example for his brother, what a guy. hell, even the obligatory hot-chick-in-panties moment was more contrived than usual. i get the feeling they expected the audience to be so shocked at the ending, as well as seeing chestbursters come out of kids, expectant mothers being raped and the like, that that would make up for everything. i don't think so.then we move onto the stars of the film, and again very little to write home about. were the aliens well-designed? i wouldn't have a clue because you can never see the damn things. all you see is one of a mouth, a head, a tail or a really dodgy cg outline climbing a wall, and barely enough to actually process that it is in fact an alien before mr "i cut marilyn manson and nin music videos, think i'll do the same thing here" editor goes at it with the slice tool. also, notice how hack action directors always set their films at night and in the rain? hmmmm. the predator could've been fighting giant sea monkeys for all we knew! yes, the predator was more impressive this time around, and i did think some of the new weaponry was cool, but that was about it. also, since when does a predator sound like a dinosaur from the lost world? there were a couple of things that i kinda liked though. one was the use of sound effects and music from the original films (i also giggled a little bit at "get to the chopper!"), although other references were stupid (the main character's name being dallas, give me a break). i also liked the visual fx for the predator's vision, as well as how the hybrid alien looked (certainly beat the one from resurrection). but really, those are the only positive things.overall i found this movie inane, pointless, insulting and above all else offensive to the vision of the original creators of both creatures. that they've left the door open for another one leaves me almost depressed.if they had any decency they'd remove dan o'bannon, ron schusett and hr giger from the credits of this film. they've done nothing to deserve this.

the movie starts off promisingly enough, the use of imagery and simple short clips convey the bigger story, which would normally need a considerably higher budget than the one here. however it did start to worry me as it continued, combined with another overly husky max payne type voice over the movie was starting to look not so good. i hoped it was just the introduction to the story.the story is what really caught me and took me to this movie. the idea that a research scientist has created a virus that actually protects the cells it infects from other infection was an interesting scientific idea. then that subjects who had the most bizarre disorders sought out the scientist and offered to be his human experiments made me think this could be one very good small movie. yet the introduction hadn't gone well.there did seem to be a change of pace as the movie turned to recorded interviews with the four main characters in the movie, the test subjects. although the acting wasn't superb, there seemed to be a lot of scope for character development throughout the movie, and the recordings were done quite well with a varied mix of characters. however these faded through the movie. they weren't used again after a few brief clips and i did feel that there was a missed opportunity to provide some great character development by reflecting back to them, however it wasn't to be.the imagery becomes increasingly disconnected from the story, often repeating to represent something that is still happening. this disconnection and repetition is reflected in the annoying and distracting commentary. it began reciting words one after the other. short, meaningless sentences and reciting none too relevant or interesting scientific ramblings. if there was something to be described, four or five words would be used, it was too long, repetitive, circular, looping,...you're getting the idea.now this could have been to reflect the confusion and of the character, slowly becoming caught up in his own thoughts, rambling due to lack of food and water. what it actually did was to cause me to totally switch off to the voice and by the closing stages of the movie i found that i hadn't been listening to some of the ramblings.a number of times that an event occurs the camera shows all the characters one after the other for their reaction, which seems to be somewhere between confused and thoughtful. there are repeated fades from the same scene to the same scene, for instance a character sleeping fades to black, then fades back in on the character sleeping again. look, we know the character is asleep, we know time has passed, please move on. overall there are just too many atmospheric cuts and long, hanging shots to fill time.the acting was not bad, and the characters were okay, but not exploited and developed. when they were interacting there were some truly cringeworthy moments. for example when one of them asks if they are hungry the camera looks to each of them and returns to a group shot, they pause, look to each other, turn back to camera and say slowly "no". it raised a snigger or two. their dialogue was slow, glossy and either it was missing altogether or totally unnecessary, there seemed to be no middle ground where the dialogue hit spot on.however, there were some good scenes, but they were really hard to find unless you viewed them in isolation, and this is what it almost looks like has happened with this movie. the film has been looked at as a series of scenes and not as a complete story.nowhere is this seen more than in the main storyline. the characters are infected with the virus that has been killing the animals, the one that was being engineered for them. we're told that it develops in stages to something dramatic, and so that is what we expect. what we get are the characters eating loads together, all throwing up once together, water pouring from their mouths in unconvincing streams, then they all fall asleep, these are the phases which all happen really early in the movie. then, they all say "good" together when asked how they are, and that's it. that's the virus done, nothing else happens.there could have been so much more done with this movie, so much more developed with the virus and it protecting them from all manner of harm. it could have explored a serious change of these characters as it infected and took over them, it could have developed these characters, shown them making decisions and doing things that connect back to their character shown in flashbacks to the interviews.the ending isn't even confusing, intriguing or thought provoking. it just shows something that happens and that's it, although in the long, drawn out style with the irritating voice over above it. i really struggled with this movie and watched a number of press members walk out (including one famous tv critic leaving within the first twenty minutes), i stayed, but regretted the lost time.

first off i want to say that i lean liberal on the political scale and i found the movie offensive. i managed to watch the whole doggone disgrace of a film . this movie brings a low to original ideas. yes it was original thus my 2 stars instead of 1. are our film writers that uncreative that they can only come up with this?? acting was horrible , and the characters were unlikeable for the most part. the lead lady in the story had no good qualities at all. they made her bf into some sort of a bad guy and i did not see that at all. maybe i missed something , i do not know.he was the most down to earth, relevant character in the movie. i did not shell out any money for this garbage. i almost wish peta would come to the rescue of this awful, offensive movie and form a protest. disgusting thats all i have to say anymore !

"inuyasha " was awful . this show was incredibly over -hyped but this is nothing but a tedious bunch of anime clichés. the characters are annoying and lifeless ,the story line is boring and endless .i think that it could have be something interesting if it have a better writing, but it seems that the writers of the show have more intentions in show inuyasha and his stupid friends fighting with some monsters and then crying for his tragic love triangle with kikyou and kagome and a lot of circles around the same thing again and again . the script is cheesy and dumb and the animation is poor .the character design it 's very ugly ,i don't know why everyone love it ,all have the same face ! : big eyes , tiny noses , a line as the mouth and the typical anime haircuts . i find "inuyasha " incredibly boring and dumb . this have to be one of the most over -rated animated shows ever made .

don't kill me fans but i have something to say about this.pros: well, the most mildly interesting season that i've watched out of all the seasons that are out there of inuyasha just has tobe the shichinintai arc. unlike the rest of the seasons, i personally think that this one has more of a real plot line and those mercenaries; good god they're such likable characters. shame they were killed off. of course, i would write a 15 page essay one why i like the shichinintai so much but that would be boring for some of you. so this series actually does have some likable characters. i'll miss bankotsu... poor, poor psycho little boy.cons: outside of shichinintai arc, the series was overall boring, repetitive and some of the characters are extremely irritating. kagome for example: she overreacts too much to my taste; she acts like yuka from elfen lied. inuyasha: he's a loud mouth dog demon with a huge sword. what's so unique about him? he has adorable dog ears! tch. sesshomaru is all talk, no action and very cocky. naraku has just got to be the wimpiest villain that ever existed in the anime world. miroku and sango... they have some color but they just seem to stand on the sidelines too much. but what bugs me the most if the fact that they have absolutely no common sense at all. rumiko takahashi has done a lot better then this. i've seen it before.if you like series with a lot of action, no annoying love triangle, no over repetitiveness, this is not for you then.

to be entirely frank, the popularity of this show saddens me. inuyasha is certainly not terrible - it has a few good moments, the occasional flash of clever humour, and, unlike so many animes, dignity. however, it is utterly lacking in the essential elements of a worthwhile story. from the start, its premise dooms it to be stereotypical. the main plot centers around collecting the pieces of a shattered jewel before they can be possessed by evil, and is, as one would suspect, a totally generic epic fantasy affair. the story follows a familiar pattern of fighting off various enemies for pieces of the jewel, and is thus quite predictable, lacking in complexity, and easy to lose interest in. but as so many animes have shown, a poor premise can be rescued by deep, realistic characters. sadly, no one rescues the story of inuyasha. kagome, the main character, is the stereotypical anime heroine (and far too reminiscent of akane, the main character of the original comic author's previous work ranma 1/2); she is kind to other females, but treats many males, especially her love interest, with unfair, unabashed, unjustifiable brutality. inuyasha is a tough-on-the-outside-but-sweet-on-the-inside type, and miroku is the lamentable stock character of "the pervert".the flaws continue with what happens to this plot and these characters - namely, nothing. despite constant action, the story does not progress. despite regular romantic moments, neither does the main relationship. despite ample time, the characters never really change. and to add a cherry to the sundae of mediocrity, all this stagnation is stretched into approximately 150 episodes.my final criticism of this anime is the animation. while certainly not ugly, it displays almost disrespectful laziness on the part of the creators. the animators seem to take joy in long scenes of inuyasha jumping through the air with wind whistling in which they have little to do but move a background.in short, with all the beautiful animations of the world at one's keyboard-perched fingertips, there is absolutely no reason to watch inuyasha.

may or may not contain spoilers. inuyasha is not a good anime. it's actually very overrated. why? there's absolutely no story line, no plot, and the show just drags on... and on... and on... that's because there are more side stories and fillers than episodes that make the plot progress. and the fillers are just the same stories being repeated over and over again. the same episodes seem to go with the same plot: kagome sensing a jewel shard, a worm/slime/tentacle demon thing pops up, inuyasha says "wind-scar", "iron reaver soul stealer", etc. and kills the demon, they get the jewel shard, and then we just repeat this scene 160 or more times.besides the repeating of episodes, there's the repeating of comedic devices, and they're not funny anymore. wait, they never were. sexual harassment is not funny. viz rated the series older teens, 16+. i have no idea why they rated it that. there's nothing bad about it except for the so-called funny sexual harassment, which is kind of suggestive, and that could get you arrested these days.now, this is how we know inuyasha is overrated. the videogames. they all sucked. especially the mask game. i played that at my friend's house. it wasn't anything interesting. the game was slow, boring, and it had nintendo 64 like graphics. in a magazine, it got a rating of 4/10, saying "...this role-playing game is slower than milkshake moving up a cocktail straw." then, there's all these stupid inuyasha toys, action figures, trading cards, stickers, and coloring books. coloring books! we thought inuyasha was 16+! maybe not... but after being a member of inuyasha groups on msn, about half the people on there were 10 to 13. i guess inuyasha is a little kid anime after all. (i think that just a small bit of editing done to this show, it could be shown on toonami.) there are over 40 manga volumes. i can only help but wonder how many miles of forest that have been cut down to make them. sad...then there's the music. the music is so annoying. we hear the same 5 songs every episode. after 10 episodes, the music gets really annoying. in other anime, they have music to fit the mood and we don't hear some songs very often. there are about 15 different inuyasha soundtracks. don't waste your money on that garbage!and how do you think i know all this? because i used to be a fan of inuyasha. i feel ashamed of myself. i'd rather watch kim possible or pokemon instead. sadly, those two shows have more romance between the two main protagonists than inuyasha will ever have...

rossini once described rival composer wagner's work as having "some wonderful moments...and some awful quarter-hours". inuyasha, it seems, can also be described this way. it has many great episodes, but in between them are countless filler episodes. the entire series consists of about 175 episodes, of which i'd say at least 125 are filler or some sort of subplot (i didn't bother to count and i wouldn't be surprised if that number were in fact higher, though).some of these filler episodes are actually quite enjoyable, though many are quite silly or dull. nonetheless, the constant digressions start to wear thin after the first few seasons as the plot ends up progressing at a labored crawl for most of the series. character development, too, slows down greatly and by the later seasons, the cast has become quite unchanging, resulting in increasingly stale jokes (particularly those concerning the monk, who's ironic traits start out as mildly humorous but grow tiresome when the jokes associated with them appear repeatedly).however, all of that isn't to say that inuyasha is a bad series. it just isn't a great series the way neon genesis evangelion, for example, is generally considered to be. as something to watch at the end of a hard day, it is nice, but it could never be confused with high art.

let me state this right from the start. i do not hate this show. i actually quite like some aspects of it. in fact, when i first started to watch it, i quickly became hooked. i was just starting to come out of the whole "anime is for kids" stereotype, and the mature elements of the show had me intrigued.unfortunately, after seeing the whole series through and a few of the films, i can say that my overall disposition has changed, and it falls into almost all of the pitfalls that plague "bad" anime. seven or eight friends and myself started watching this series on tv. by the end, only one friend and i were still watching and neither of us liked it.allow me to explain the plot for you. you can skip this paragraph if you don't want to know. kagome is an average high school student, who one day falls into a magical well near her family run shrine. when kagome comes out of the well again, she has been transported back in time to the feudal era of japan. she meets up with many other characters and they form a group of five or so companions who set off on a journey of revenge/justice/groping in one characters case =). overall, they are trying to recover the pieces of the sacred jewel shard which enhances the power of demons who use it.while there are many, many side stories and story arcs, there is no were near enough material to occupy 167 episodes. the only story arc that is interesting enough to watch is still sort of dull (the band of seven). after the half way mark in the series or maybe even before, it becomes painfully obvious that the plot is frozen in place and whoever made the series decided instead to put in dozens and dozens of filler episodes. these episodes have little to no impact on the story, and rarely even on the characters. in some cases, some characters who had an important role in the story will disappear for dozens of episodes at a time. many episodes follow the exact same cookie cutter patterns as the stories before it. inuyasha shoots wind-scar at enemy. windscar deflects. characters gasp in horror. enemy turns out to have barrier. characters spent three episodes trying to kill enemy before kagome finally fires sacred arrow at him and he turns to dust. also **major spoiler: the conclusion will be revealed** the lack of any conclusion makes it seem like you have waisted 83 hours. **major spoiler over**the animation itself is above average, and in some cases excellent. even so, reused animation cells plague most action scenes, and it is very hard to ignore them when it is clear that the exact same boulder has flown past a character five or six times in a row.on the brighter side however, all of the characters are very well developed and the romances between some of the characters were truly captivating. also, the character designs (appearences) were brilliant and at times among the best i have seen, particularly with the band of seven. there is definitely no shortage of cosplay opportunities here. even so, i found myself hoping that a character would die just so there would be some sort of movement in the plot. and some of the humour in the show between characters is used again and again. one particular joke (sit boy) is found within the first five episodes, and you can literally expect it to be used again and again for the remaining 162 episodes.although there are some good aspects of the show and it is easy to see why it has a huge following, the series seems to be dominated by obsessed fan girls who drool over sesshomiru and inuyasha.bottom line: definitely worth checking out, but not worth watching the whole series. the first 30 episodes are very clever, original and enjoyable for anybody. but after that, it simply becomes dull and tedious. watching a tv show should never feel like a chore, but somehow this series accomplishes just that. don't expect much from "inuyasha", because you will only feel let down.

oh man! this series has to be the worst possible anime i've ever seen in a while.it started out new, exciting and fresh. and i really liked it then. kagome was a good female role model for the show. and inu-yasha was funny and hot-headed.then, it just kept falling more and more downhill as the series progressed... and i'll tell y'all the reasons why. (warning: spoiler alert!!)okay, they basically destroy inu-yasha's relationship with kagome early on, by reviving his 50 year old dead girlfriend, who's drippy, sappy, and a total waste of time.they introduce a pervert named miroku, who's supposed to be a sort of religious figure for the show. (which really bugged me,'cause it was out of place and stupid.) then, they introduce a demon slayer named sango, whose only purpose in life is to try (and fail) to save her brainwashed brother.the big bad of the show, naraku, while starting out as a really good bad guy, lost his touch after a while. (he got pretty old pretty fast. and it bothered me that he was the only baddie in the show who did anything.)the characters all became wooden, and unemotional. and then, the ending of this terrible series was a disappointment to any anime fan out there. nothing happened. naraku never got killed or defeated. kagome and inu-yasha never fully fell in love ('cause he was still all in love with his 50 year old dead chick.) plot holes were left open. the animation got worse and worse as the series progressed. and nothing changed in the plot. (i mean,they dragged it out to over 150 episodes, and nothing changed in the plot... at all.) and they expected me (as well as other fans of the show) to be satisfied?? i was disenchanted, disgusted, and annoyed as crap. i at least had high hopes that there'd be a good ending to the series. instead, all i got was a dragged out commercial for the manga.seriously, if you wanna see a good anime about swords and stuff like that, i strongly recommend "rurouni kenshin". that show progresses and goes somewhere, plus it has really good animation too.but stay far away from this bland excuse for anime, as best as you can.

will there be please coming an end to hyping movies that are dealing about social conflicts or other human disasters? okay "care" is about childabuse, "care" is about perverts misusing boys in a school and how disgusting it might be, if it's a movie with a poor script and made with bad playing actors then it stays a bad movie. "care" is a movie that could have been, but is it because it was a tvmovie i don't know but everything seemed so limited that it comes over as some cheap movie that will be seen by some housewifes and fathers who decide not to go to bed. there are so many unanswered things in this movie...the relation with his mother for instance or the death of some abused boy from which we know nothing more. "care" should have been much much better.

the film is nothing else than an exposition of nudity. has anyone noticed that all three main female characters appear naked? it looks like the only winning bet for portuguese filmmakers is to include some (if not a lot) of nudity of the local stars, together with slang which otherwise, in the nowadays portuguese society, is repulsed with horror. if you watch advertising for portuguese films at portuguese tvs, they all have included a "hot" scene from the movie. i'm not saying, by any means, that portuguese society is alienated; just that the movie industry does not seem capable of finding others ways of success. going back to the movie... there is nothing left from the spirit of the book, which is a masterpiece. the film could have been a good one, had there been emphasized the real idea of the book (of actuality at any time) and not the strictly erotic part. it had almost all the ingredients... but the "chef" was awful...

as you might not know eça de queiroz is one of portugal's most rightfully celebrated writers. he was witty, he spared no one in his critics and must now be rolling in his tomb. and that's not due to this movie being bad, which it is, but as a result of the treatment dispensed to one of his masterworks "o crime do padre amaro". it's treated like cheap, throwaway trash.when it was publicized that this was to be a "modern and urban" take on the book i feared for the worst, normally modern in these contexts means taking the liberty to take the p**** when doing an adaptation, to half arse it in the shoddiest possible way. and so the moral and social dilemma of a priest having a secret,forbidden affair are substituted by extra-long passages of people dealing drugs and singing hip-hop for no particular or pertinent reason to the plot. it's just there like it might very well not have been.oh and there's lots of sex so you can at least be counting on that when you put this on. remember how every movie in the 80's, no matter the genre or the tone always found a way to sneak in some nudity? if it was a thriller and they had no need for it they simply found a way that when they were capturing a felon he "happened" to be in bed with a woman that would prance around screaming (naked of course) when the cops barged in. ahem, gratuitous is the word i think. not that there's anything wrong with nude scenes but here they make the creators of this movie look desperate simply because there's nothing else to the movie, it's totally devoid of what do you call it dramatic content.

i was not making big assumptions on the fact that this for sure was a very, very free adaptation from the work of eça de queiroz, and i must say that this free adaptation form the book as a lot of possible good ideas and characters. the problem is the way that is done, without any care, without any taste, just a rumble of bad taste clichés everywhere. the script is so fake and the characters so unreal that's makes petty seeing nice actors as unas, bryner, morgado, lagarto and others, lost themselves in a net of whatever except cinema or storytelling. for my surprise the newcomers jorge corrula and soraia chaves bravely stick in their performances, but you can see them lost like a drifted boat without any direction. and talking about direction, this seems to be something totally missing on this moviewhere's the director? everything is bad taste; the frames are whatever, and whenever, the use of hand camera without any justified reason, the light design that should build environments doesn't exist (and no excuses that the all point is a dark real story). the problem overall in this "trying to be" film is that as no taste, or very, very bad taste. it's sad to see jorge and soraia melting away in such fake and gratuity sex scenes, painted here and there trough out the movie like closing narratives holes or used as fakes transition motives. maybe carlos coelho da silva should see the 2002 carlos carrera adaptation of the same book of eça and get the felling of how to build a true movie.

i saw this film yesterday on tv. i had just finished reading the book in which the movie was supposedly based. in the opening credits it said "this is a free adaptation of eça de queirós' novel". i should have turned off my tv at that moment.vera sacramento's idea of "free adaptation" is turning a story about church's influence over people and the hypocrisy of people claiming morality at the end of the 19th century into a story about sex. in fact, the only thing she adopted from the novel was the sex part, which was only mildly referred in eça de queirós' novel. and, of course, the name of some characters.as of the characters, in the novel, amélia and joão eduardo were victims of church's influence. amélia was seduced by father amaro and all the time she was controlled by him. joão eduardo, her fiancé, was excommungated by the priests, because he dared to criticize them. in this movie, amélia seduces every one she meets and father amaro is just another victim. joão eduardo is a dealer of drugs and illegal weapons.vera sacramento has turned a novel which criticized moral costumes of an epoch and turned it into just another movie with lots of (bad) sex. even worse, her story was completely empty of ideas. two wasted hours! eça de queirós surely did not deserve this.

i turned this off within the first five minutes. it's very sick and disturbing, the moment i turned this off was when the beautiful white horse was let into the slaughterhouse and it's skull was punctured by a small tubed instrument. this creature was lying on the floor in a state of shock before it died. the narrator said the animal dies instantaneously, it didn't. i don't agree with graphic realism towards animals, insects or any living creature. i was very disappointed as i had just watched 'eyes without a face' which was a brilliant movie and this short film was attached, which spoilt my night - as i couldn't hurt a fly, never mind watching this savage documentary.reading other reviews on this page, i had noticed they used words such as aesthetic - this is not art or beauty. i can imagine that the documentary would be very articulate and profound but not aesthetic.

well its ten year's on since this film was released and the sands of time have not improved it one bit, again like the other comments made the aussie film makers should have a little more drama rather than middle class aussies riding around beautiful places on there bikes with not much in the was of dialog. middle class is not funny nor is rich. there is also a mish mash of cast. why is a young woman going to marry a man old enough to be her father, it escapes me. it's such a shame about this film, looks like a wonderful place to holiday thou. anyway its an hour and thirty mins of my life i will never be able to get back. lifes to short to watch this movie.

this appalling piece of tripe was (conveniently) loosely based on a true story that involved two family members of mine (played by jack thompson and jacqueline mackenzie).this film is offensive; besides the fact that it wasn't a particular good film anyway, it does not in any way capture what it was like to lose such a close family member and completely omits those who were really affected by the true-life tragedy.as for the director; he managed to cash in on a family's misfortune for the price of a porsche.if i could have given this a zero i would have.avoid this film at all costs.

the brief existence of the sex pistols and the making of this film after the controversial, groundbreaking english punk band's break-up both happened before i was born. however, i started listening to their only album, "never mind the b*&%@#&s, here's the sex pistols", in 2003, when i was a teenager, and quickly became a big fan. i didn't see "the great rock 'n' roll swindle" until 2006, but saw it a couple times that year, and thought it was pretty good (certainly not great, but pretty good), even if i could only remember bits of it, and didn't see how it all connected. seeing it a third time, nearly three years after the second, i didn't care much for it at all. i'm not even sure what i found so good about most of it in the first place (can't remember now).this film is a mockumentary, in which sex pistols manager malcolm mclaren tells his side of the story of the band and its members; guitarist steve jones, credited here as "the crook"; drummer paul cook, credited as "the tea-maker"; bassist sid vicious, credited as "the gimmick"; and john lydon (a.k.a. johnny rotten) credited as "the collaborator." mclaren claims that he created the band (and even the genre of punk rock) as a scam to make money. he tells much of the story to helen wellington-lloyd (a.k.a. helen of troy), in various places where they go together. it's basically a hodgepodge of mclaren talking, pistols songs, live footage of the band, fictional scenes (often silly, strange ones), several cartoon sequences, etc., all put together in one film, to tell the pistols manager's side of the story in a bizarre way!it has been well proved that mclaren is a liar, i know many have already pointed this out, including band members themselves. he was not the driving force of the band, he didn't create them (nor did he invent punk rock, and the sex pistols weren't even the first punk band, though they were unique). the band members were the ones who made the band what it was. "the filth and the fury", a much more believable film about the band from julien temple, who made this film, is told from the point of view of the band members, who contradict mclaren's claims. however, the dishonesty of "the great rock 'n' roll swindle" is not my biggest problem with it. if it were actually entertaining (which i used to think it was to a certain extent), i would be able to overlook that, like i obviously used to be able to do. during my third viewing, apart from sex pistols songs, some live footage, and at least one mildly amusing cartoon sequence, it was pretty dull! i found the "who killed bambi" song mildly amusing at first, but it got tiring very quickly.is this mockumentary worth watching for sex pistols fans? it seems a good number of fans would say it is, not to learn about the true story of the short-lived but groundbreaking 70's punk band, but for entertainment. that was once my opinion on "the great rock 'n' roll swindle". after the first time i watched it, i couldn't remember a thing mclaren said, and by the time i saw it the second time, i was aware of what the pistols manager was using this film to imply, but could still barely remember anything i heard him say! obviously, other aspects of the film were what i found impressive. now, after my third viewing, i can definitely remember some of the things mclaren says, but it still wasn't 100% clear. like most of the film, i guess his words are not that memorable, probably because of the way they're presented. if you're a pistols fan, i guess it wouldn't hurt to give "swindle" a try, but to me, for the most part, it's just an incoherent, boring mess that tries to be funny but fails.

from the epicenter of the cultural globe, four working class teenagers attempted to change the world through music and fashion. it was the final attempt to do so last century, and they failed. before the dust had cleared, band manager and sex shop proprietor malcolm mclaren spent the money the sex pistols had earned to make a "mockumentary" about his own role in their success. the film was called the great rock 'n roll swindle (take the hint) and consists of very little footage of the sex pistols actually playing music, and quite a lot of footage of mclaren effectively calling the audience idiots.cod-surrealist nonsense in which guitarist steve jones is a detective on mclaren's tail, soon dissolves so he and drummer paul cook can jet off to rio and spend time with "great train robber" ronnie biggs. ready yourself for the spectacle of three very unappealing men dancing naked to a hideous irony-free version of "belsen was a gas" (a song about killing jews for gold in bergen-belsen concentration camp), and another song sung in ronnie's tone deaf whine which includes the lyrics "god save myra hindley, god save ian brady" (lyrics that johnny rotten would have considered distasteful). the sid vicious scenes are few and idiotic. jumping out of bed in a thong with a swastika over the testicles to sing some bad boy biker song from the '50s. playing into to the "punk's a joke" theme of the movie, in an attempt to turn sid into james dean. i'm surprised mclaren doesn't take credit for siddy's death too. the redeeming scenes are those of sid in paris and the infamous performance of my way. the punk rock zeitgeist right there. mocking an adoring audience before shooting them all. no need for an entire film, just watch that clip on youtube.from julien temple's far superior (and more enjoyable) 2001 documentary followup, the filth and the fury, we were given a more balanced/honest view of what transpired in '78. but there were also a number of scenes that i would have liked to have seen in swindle (as fury was basically a reediting of the same material). one was an animated sid complete with sid's voice acting; "you f*cken betta wat'ch out, alright, or i'll slice you open" - a still of which appeared on the cover of the something else 7 inch - a snippet was shown in fury, but i don't know what context that originally appeared. was it in original prints, but removed after sid's death? was there more? fury also shed light on the film who killed bambi, which would have been the mock hard day's night movie mclaren was originally intending to make. it starred sting(!) as a member of a gay new romantics group, and looked a damn sight more entertaining than swindle.sod swindle, t'is a swindle. if you must, rent the filth and the fury and revel in music's failure as a world changing polemic.

not only is the great rock n roll swindle thoroughly inaccurate, but when it comes down to it, not much about it is interesting or even entertaining. malcolm mclaren apparently squandered the majority of the sex pistols earnings on this waste of film, which makes it that much more obnoxious. the intention, from the beginning, was to create a monument to the "genius" of mclaren, who to this day takes full credit for creating punk music, creating the sex pistols, and at times even writing all the songs. viewers follow mclaren to various settings, where he tells his story to his sidekick, a female dwarf, and simply takes credit for one thing after another. one particularly irritating scene has mclaren in an abandoned airplane hangar, waiting for a plane, being hounded by reporters and giving them their "big story". the most entertaining elements of the film are the animated short pieces, however, even these reek of mclaren's overbearing self-importance.even as a farce, this film doesn't work. little about it is entertaining, except for steve jones, who is surprisingly decent as a pseudo-detective type person. 20 years later, julien temple, who wrote and directed this film, also directed the sex pistols documentary "the filth and the fury". while that movie is much better and more interesting than "swindle", it still is full of temple's "artistic flourishes" that just don't work, like interviewing band members in shadow, as if they are some kind of crime witness trying to hide their identity. an interesting bit of trivia: film critic roger ebert was one of the original scriptwriters for the movie "who killed bambi?", which eventually became "swindle".

to this day, malcolm mclaren is telling anyone daft enough to believe him that the sex pistols were his idea and that the band members were his puppets to be used to make him money. there is a good reason for him doing this, namely that he is a liar.here are some real facts.* mclaren was actually approached by the band to be manager, not the other way round.* the pistols were a proper, organic band and not created by mclaren or anyone else. jones and cook were childhood friends. rotten and vicious went back a long way too. this is something that has led to unfair criticism of the pistols down the years as they have been likened to manufactured boy bands.* the band and no one else wrote the songs, recorded them, played live, created the publicity and gave the interviews.* mclaren did not instigate the bill grundy incident. the pistols only appeared on the programme because queen had pulled out. according to the band, mclaren was cowering in the back in case arrests were about to be made.* johnny rotten walked out of the band. he was not sacked.* far from outwitting the sex pistols, john lydon (rotten) actually successfully sued him in the 1980s for control and a considerable sum of money. some of the evidence used by lydon's lawyers was from mclaren's boasting in 'the great rock & roll swindle'. this would suggest that mclaren is none too bright despite his affectations.* the sackings and subsequent pay offs from a & m and emi were, again, not engineered, it was merely the way things panned out.* mclaren boasts about the money he made from the band. if he had been competent, he could have made a great deal more. it seems he coudn't even organise gigs properly.* mclaren's claim at the start of the film that he invented punk rock can be disproved in about ten seconds. the pistols were not the first punk band, merely the most high profile.this is a terrible film. the only parts worth watching are the genuine footage of the band, later put to much better use in 'the filth and the fury'.

i will not spoil your surprise by mentioning any of the hideous plot lines, i'll just say that this movie suffers from poor animation, over acting, obvious tag lines these are some of it's good qualities. if you are deserted on an isolated island and the only link to civilization you got is this movie throw it to the fish. i can't tell you how much i'm sorry i saw this horrifying ghastly movie. speaking of which, this movie supposedly a horror movie cannot be classified as such for the simple fact that the only horror in the movie is the playing capabilities of some of the actors.take care.

there is only way to describe this movie.so bad its hilarious.the acting is so bad i laughed my ass off throughout. the male lead in this movie trying to use a gun is so ridiculous you would think he was trying to copy a toy action figure, i know this sounds ridiculous but when you see it for yourself you can't help but agree.the monster looks like a cgi guy trying to recreate the clay monsters you get in old sinbad movies.in short this movie is good for only one thing a really large laugh at how bad movies can get.if you want to see bad acting bad script and special effects gone wrongthis is the movie for you

the acting was flat (at least none of the actors sounded like they'd just got the script that morning) and the film and sound quality made me think of the 70s movie of the week bombs. the only thing that told me that it was indeed not a 70s movie of the week was the reference to dna testing. but for me, being eastern orthodox, the most egregious thing about this....film.....was the total romishness of the religion. romania is 88% orthodox but you'd never know that from this movie: father soren is irish. and i'd have known this even if i hadn't seen the actor play the irish pub keep, michael sullivan in star trek: voyager's "fairhaven" episodes. the bishop was wearing roman vestments (and for the record not even orthodox bishops wear their vestments unless they're saying the liturgy, especially if they live in a monastery). about the only non-romish paraphernalia i saw was the 3-bar cross on the door of the church, and even then i had to squint to see it. the first reviewer said the producers had done their research. well, if that's true they messed up on the religious aspect of the film.

this movie is like porn with all of the good parts removed. it's like all of the porn stars that didn't want to fulfill their obligations banded together around this awful, trite, useless piece of gargoyle abstinence.this is a helpful movie if you're in the mood to torture a loved (or no longer loved) one. it's important that, if you choose to use this movie as a method of torture, that you put in earplugs and put on a blindfold to keep yourself from going insane.if i had a choice between this movie and the 700 club...i'd choose girls gone wild.overall, better if you've been drinking. but only because it becomes a drinking game of epic proportions.

gargoyle starts late one night in 'romania 1532' as a peasant girl (daniela nane) travels along in her horse & cart minding her own business when from the moonlit clouds above a living gargoyle swoops down & attacks her, she manages to escape the gargoyle & happens upon a castle of some description where an angry mob of local villagers & a priest are able to put an end to the gargoyle, or so they think... cut to present day bucharest where two cia agents ty griffin (michael pare) & jennifer wells (sandra hess) are about to negotiate the safe return of the son of a rich american ambassador from his kidnappers. in pursuit of one of the kidnappers griffin loses him on the roof of a building but finds a large pool of blood & no visible signs of what happened to him. meanwhile dr. christina durant (kate orsini) & her colleague richard barrier (jason rohrer) are renovating a church when the church labourer gregor (mihai bisericanu) informs richard that he has found some ancient relic, the two investigate & find a cave with lots of slimy cocoons & one very angry & very much alive gargoyle who wastes no time in killing them both. griffin & wells are on the case when they are reported missing & soon realise that local legends of monstrous gargoyles are true with a local priest named father soren (fintan mckeown) planning to flood the world with them...co-written, co-produced & directed by jim wynorski under his usual pseudonym jay andrews gargoyles is yet another masterpiece wynorski can add to his credits, not. the script by wynorski, ion ionescu, a.g. lawrence & bill munroe is crap, is unexciting, dull & is as simplistic as you can get. for a start i would like to know if there was only one gargoyle left who laid all those eggs because i'm pretty sure it couldn't have made itself pregnant. how did it survive in that hole for 500 years? what did it eat? how did the priest know it was there? why has no one else ever figured it out? why did the priest want to flood the world with them? to rule it? the gargoyles are hardly going to take over the world & then let some priest just rule it like a king & if they did what would be left to rule? much like the guys who wrote gargoyle i don't think he thought it through that well did he? whichever way i look at it, whichever way i approach it, from whichever angle i try to figure it out from, no matter how many times i try to square the circle gargoyles just doesn't make any sense & they story has huge plot holes, lapses in logic & isn't that great to start with anyway. the character's are dull & clichéd, the action repetitive & unexciting while the film as a whole is a real bore to sit through. people do illogical things & everything that happens is far to convenient like when the priest is try to convince griffin that gargoyle's exist & one just suddenly shows up & attacks them. the cave full of cocoons is such a rip-off of aliens (1986) it's embarrassing & the ending was lame. the bit on the large ferris wheel at the fair was funny though when the guy mocked the boys fear of heights & forced him to get on it.director wynorski cuts costs & steals footage from other films, in fact the best scene from gargoyle is a car chase through bucharest but it was taken from the jean-claude van damme action film maximum risk (1996). there are no shocks, scares or atmosphere. the special effects are terrible, the cgi gargoyle looks like it belongs in a computer game & has little interaction with any living cast members, there are lots of scenes of people looking up to the sky & trying to appear scarred. there isn't even any worthwhile gore to make the thing watchable, there is one awful decapitation & that's it.technically the special effects are awful but otherwise it's passable, the romanian locations look suitably romanian. gargoyle went straight-to-video & it shows with a pretty cheap look & feel to it. the acting isn't up to much, personality bypass victim michael pare makes for the dullest of dull heroes.gargoyle is a crap film, it fails at everything a decent creature feature should strive to achieve. a total waste of 90 minutes as far as i'm concerned, one to avoid.

you know that mouthwash commercial where the guy has a mouth full of listerine or whatever it is and he's trying really hard to keep from spitting it up into the sink? that's a great metaphor for this movie. i kept watching, even though it was really difficult. but keeping mouthwash in your mouth will leave you with a minty fresh feeling. this movie left me with a bad taste in my mouth. i should have spit it out when i had the chance.the premise is corny enough to be fun. for the first time in like a thousand years, gargoyles have returned to romania, and all of the priests who knew how to fight and kill these things are long dead. it's up to michael pare and some other secret agents to get to the bottom of things before the gargoyles run amok. unfortunately, the premise is completely lost in bad dialog and less than enthusiastic acting on the part of the human leads. the best acting is done by the cg gargoyles.in the end, this movie feels like a poor man's van helsing. if you check your brain at the door, this might get you through a dreary monday night. i gave it 3 out of 10 stars.

this is just one of the hundred million movies where the directors try to shove too much drama into a movie that's not dramatic at all. like in the beginning, the part where the monk dude shoved the arrow into his own hand, then shot that same arrow into the gargoyle five minutes later--no sense whatsoever.the only thing worse than the plot line is the cgi, which would be greatly rivaled by a homemade flash movie. the actors look like they're doing their hardest to portray a bunch of 70's robots; the dialogue makes so little sense it's not funny.many things just happen with no explanation as to how or why, such as a lady suddenly wandering around a zoo that had shut down hours ago. and when she sees this thing flying towards her, her first reaction is to take a picture, rather than what she does a full ten minutes later---power-walking (not even running) like her life depended on it--which, obviously, it doesn't.overall, not recommended. makes me wish they still did new episodes of mst3k.

i don't think i'm spoiling anyone's experience of this film by telling you not to see it if you have anything better to do, like clean under the stove. it gets dirty under there and you've gotta clean it sometime. i think the movie suffers from a lack of sex and violence, though there is one car chase stunt that looks so dangerous it could only have been filmed in a country where life is cheaper than beer. "gargoyle"'s heart is in the right place, but its aspirations are conservative. it is at least not pretentious. but i had a great time acting in it, playing the perennial idiot in the horror movie who says "what's down this hole?" and dies for his hubris. plus i got to meet michael pare. every film junkie should work with a b-movie staple at least once before death. and romanians are the loveliest people i've met. literally the loveliest. walk down the street in bucarest: if 7 of every 10 women aren't absolutely beautiful, you're walking down a street i didn't come across; and be consoled by the fact that at least 5 of the 10 are available for drinks.part of the film was shot in casa radio, an abandoned, unfinished classic communist bloc-cum-georgian nightmare edifice originally intended to house kgb propaganda ministries, i.e. radio not-so-free europe. the building's five stories tall and takes up a city block; best of all, while its facade radiates big brotheresque state solidity, it resides near the city center like a post-apocalyptic ruin in a jungle of burdock and hemp peopled by dozens of gypsies and scores of wild dogs. construction on casa radio was suspended when caucescu and his wife were executed on tv in 1989, and still there are gaping holes that drop from the sun-baked top floor (offering surreal vistas of a modern quarter-mile stretch of concrete roof, decorated with jutting rebar and old car parts, overlooking a crumbling ancient city) all the way down to the damp, creepy sub-basement (which doubles in the film for the gargoyle lair.) no american-style guardrails or warning signs for bucarest. since the demise of the soviet union, casa radio has hosted several non-union film shoots, including "highlander iii". it is attractive to producers because it's a cheap location, massive in terms of scale and available space, bizarre looking, and free of insurance headaches as it's still state property. plus no one complains if you don't clean up after your production: anything left onsite is interpolated into the resident gypsies' construction of their shanty town in this actual urban jungle. an assistant director was bitten bloody by a wild dog during the shoot of "gargoyle". the apples provided by catering were pressed into service by cast and crew as projectiles in order to keep the prowling dogs at bay. i too was bitten by wild dogs in bucarest, once in a bar (!) and once in a city park. i also survived two car wrecks in two weeks, both in taxis and neither of which was seen by the drivers involved as grounds for stopping the cars.geek note: the sci-fi network or channel or whatever was one of the backers of this film (the smaller the budget, the more producers on set), so it's a little weird that nobody had a problem with the original title, "gargoyles", until it was almost time to show it on the network, even though sci-fi already had an unrelated series of that name. the title was changed sometime relatively close to release, as i have a color-corrected copy labeled with the former title.

going into teaching mrs tingle, all i wanted was a fun, enjoyable teen comedy that would entertain me for it's running time. despite a rather good first half hour, the film quickly subsides into a dull, clichéd mess that's about as entertaining as pulling out your eyelashes with pliers. rusty pliers, at that. 'scream' writer kevin williamson wrote and directed this movie, and proved that scream may well have been a fluke. most of the elements of this movie have been seen a million times already in other films; and while it was ok for him to steal elements from other movies in scream, due to the fact that it's meant as a slasher tribute; here, it just looks like he's completely ran out of ideas. the plot follows the cleverest girl in school, played by katie holmes. after being caught cheating along with two of her friends; the three decide to take the teacher that caught them hostage in her own home. however, this isn't just any teacher; it's mrs tingle, the meanest bitch in school. she isn't taking being tied to the bed lying down either, as she begins to play mind games to turn her captors against each other.the plot is very similar to the 1997 flick 'suicide kings', and a whole host of earlier films. it's actually not a bad idea for a movie, and if williamson could have populated the film with interesting characters; it could have worked really well. the character of mrs tingle is the most interesting in the movie, but she's massively one dimensional, and like all the other characters in the film; is merely a caricature. the acting is largely diabolical, with the exception of helen mirren in the title role. she's suitably evil in the role, and while she doesn't have a lot to get her teeth into; she clearly enjoys herself playing the central figure. the teenage cast isn't worth mentioning, with only katie holmes standing out; and that's only really because of her star profile, not her acting talents. williamson has draped nearly every scene in dull soft rock music, which would be really annoying if the film wasn't absolutely terrible anyway. honestly, this movie does have a few moments that are rather good; but basically, if you want to see a good example of the teen comedy - this isn't the movie that you want to see.

ridiculous thriller in which a group of students kidnapped their bad and neurotic teacher (mirren) just to prevent her action against them. interesting premise could render a good movie but this one is just lame and far fetched. boring with an ending embarassing, just to say the least. mrs. mirren tries to give some dignity to this misfire but even she - a good actress, no doubt about it - could save this garbage. i give this a 4 (four).

i though that it was hard, if not impossible, to watch, and not because of the horrors it depicts but by the way they were depicted. imagine what costa gavras could have done with this true horror story. what i object to is the idea the need to denounce, which i subscribe to, is enough. what about showing it to us with the power of powerful cinema. i feel that the eagerness of the filmmaker, maybe even the justifiable anger, didn't allow him to see it clearly from a cinematic point of view. or, if this was a cinematic point of view, i mean, a choice, then, i didn't like it at all. i was more disturbed by the way the movie was shot than by the movie itself. well intentioned i'm sure, but, unfortunately, that's not nearly enough.

i had watched this on italian tv as a kid and recall being fond of it – in view of its mixing live-action with animation; however, it was universally panned at the time…and, catching up with it again after all these years, i have to admit that the critics were right! what must have seemed wondrous to a child's eyes is actually very poorly done, not to mention boring for a fantasy-adventure; fatally, both star (ex-'angry young man' richard harris) and director (action expert hunt) are ill-suited to the material! at least, michel legrand's score (with lyrics provided by scriptwriter don black) is serviceable – if not exactly inspired. by the way, a number of well-known personalities are featured among the voice artists on this british-belgian co-production (julian glover, bessie love, murray melvin, robert rietty, vladek sheybal, graham stark and, this being his last film work, michael bates).while the essential plot points of jonathan swift's classic novel ('giant' gulliver becomes the pawn in a war between the little people of two neighboring countries and, on escaping, ends up in a land of real giants) do emerge here, it's done on a strictly kiddie level (with stereotyped characters though, thankfully, little intrusion of the comic/romantic variety) – which renders the whole venture somewhat pointless, outside of its intrinsically experimental nature, since max and dave fleischer had already done a splendid feature-length cartoon version of the book way back in 1939!

the 1977 animated-live action hybrid version of gulliver's travels (or rather 'travel,' since he only gets as far as lilliput) didn't get much of a release, and it's not too difficult to see why. michel legrand comes up with some catchy tunes, but they merely inspire lyricist don black to the likes of "one simple fact remains/no-one here suffers from growing pains.' richard harris once again over-indulges in his passion for excessive makeup, toning down the eyeliner for far too much foundation this time in an effort to hide the fact he's at least 25 years too old for the role, but at least he (perhaps inappropriately) reduces his larger-than-life tendencies for a performance made up mainly of patronising whispering. the belgian animation looks only slightly better than early morning french children's tv, but peter hunt's film is not nearly as bad as it sounds  the use of real model sets for the animated characters harks back to max and dave fleischer's 1939 version while a couple of moments of swiftian satire do remain - although it's definitely aimed at the youngest of children.

a terminally dull mystery-thriller, which may sound pretty sound theoretically but plays out very poorly. the ludicrous script is full of (minor spoiler) people dying and then coming back to life when the plot requires them to, and the director doesn't seem able to work up any energy and suspense. the gooey sequence that kind of "explains" the film's title is the only halfway memorable one in this tiresome film. (*1/2)

so many great actors, so little worth watching. but with a script that misses so much of what made the book special, i don't hold it against anyone on screen. though flawed, the book was one of grisham's only that i truly liked, especially how it captured the flavor of a deep south small town, a slightly different world to a coastal urbanite such as myself. i also loved the matter-of-factness, naturalness of what occurs in the book. in the movie characters are given a "nobility" of personality that seemed so stilted. the villains and foils are flat and 1 dimensional. but as with so much of joel schumacher's work, genuineness and authenticity are conspicuously absent, and every point must be delivered via sledgehammer to the midsection. so preachy, stilted, and superficial about so horrendous a tragedy, i wish someone would do a remake and get the story a little more right.

regardless of whether the predominant social message of this film - that vigilante justice is acceptable - is justifiable, i was more insulted by mcconaughey's closing statement. in a courtroom drama, the closing statement of the defence attorney is pretty much the crux of the film, and when the issue is as difficult to resolve as this one, the statement is really being delivered to the audience as well as the jury. this basically implies that the audience consider the rape of a white girl to be a more horrific crime than the rape of a black girl. i for one find this very insulting. as for the rest, i found the acting reasonable, with the exception of sandra bullock, who seems to be playing her usual bubbly self (doesn't really work in a courtroom drama), but what's the point when the film's message is as poor as this one. it tells you that vigilante justice is fine, and accuses you of racism if you disagree.

this movie endorses self-justice! it grants freedom to a black man who killed the men who raped his daughter and in the end he gets of scat-free! despicable enough as this may be, there is also adultery in this film. the connaughey character has the hots for the bullock character and the film has some of those stereotypes of trial films (like the important news brought to the court in the nick of time)that make every aesthetically demanding film-goer such as me sick! i really cannot believe that someone liked this junk. it is a film so bad and holding up false ideals that i am unable to put my critic in an eloquently pleasing way. when will the american people wake up and find out that they are being manipulated 24/7 by films like these that turn reality into some bs where there is justice for all if only they take it into their hands. this cowboy attitude just makes me sick and in my eyes it represents everything that is wrong with america!

i have not read "a time to kill" by john grisham, and perhaps that would have helped understand the film better. but perhaps not. i hear this is the most faithful grisham adaption yet, and if that is true, i can see why so many publishers turned down the novel when grisham introduced it as his first work."a time to kill" is one of those films that is seriously confused and wants to do too many things at once. it wants to be a suspenseful crowd-pleasing thriller and, at the same time, a film dedicated to exploring certain social and moral questions. let's face it, those two types of films do not go together in hollywood, which is why "dead man walking" had to be made independently.the story involves a young lawyer named jake (matthew mcconaughy) out to defend a black man named carl (samuel l. jackson) from murdering two hillbillies that brutally raped his young daughter. the day before the rapists' trial, carl hid in a closet in the courthouse and when the rapists were brought through the building, he charged out and shot both of them dead. to help out with the defense, jack accepts the help of a former law student (sandra bullock), who proves that her role in this film was totally unnecessary, and put in the film only for marketing purposes.meanwhile, one of the rapist's kid brother (kiefer sutherland) was angered that a black man killed his brother and decided to act out a revenge. all of this leads to a shooting in front of the courthouse, a kidnapping, a brutal beating, and race riot. i'll admit that all of this held my attention greatly throughout the film, in addition to the courtroom scenes. what i later objected to was the film's handling of ethical questions and its use of formulas in the plot.the main question that the film constantly asks, over and over again, is whether a black man gets a fair trial from a white jury. sure they can, but that doesn't mean that the man has to be acquitted in order for the trial to be fair. this film, however, doesn't seem to think so. besides that, there several gaping holes in the plot used for conveniences. for example, there is an unknown character called mickey mouse, who is a member of the klan, and, for reasons unknown, is helping the members of the defense team escape from serious dangers of the other members of the klan. after bullock is kidnapped by sutherland and company, and left for dead in the wilderness, this unknown person comes and saves her---and we never find out who he is and why he is helping out the people he should be terrorizing.and speaking of the sutherland character's reign of terror, it's amazing how witless the police and the bullock character are in stopping him throughout the film. there's a scene when sutherland becomes a sniper from a building across the street from the courthouse and tries to shoot jake as he comes out, shooting one of the guards instead. now you'd think since there are dozens of police around, it would be easy to surround and capture the sniper. no such luck. from what we could see, no one seemed to even care that a sniper was still on the loose. even after bullock, was rescued by mickey mouse, she never, ever mentioned who her kidnapper was, nor was it even questioned. why was this? simple. the sutherland character was needed throughout the film to add continual suspense, although logically, he should have been out of the picture.besides bullock's character, there another thankless character. he is jake's assistant played by oliver platt. there seems to be one reason for his character to be in the movie--to supply a number of one-liners for the audience. in my opinion, one-liners show a major weakness in "serious" films when used. it demonstrates that the filmmakers are not confident that the story and dialogue alone are enough to keep the audience's attention, and so use them to make the audience laugh to reassure everyone that they are watching an entertaining film.but enough of the film's many minor problems. what about the film's message here? it is clear that carl is indeed guilty of murder. we saw how he planned for hours to murder the men who raped his daughter. the lawyers argue that it was temporary insanity, etc that caused him to kill. in desperation, jake asks the jury to close their eyes as he recounts the rape in detail as part of his closing arguement. after describing everything that took place, he adds on one final line..."the girl is white". we then see members of the jury with tears in their eyes.in the very next scene, a girl comes out yelling "he's free! he's free!". wait a minute! do juries base their verdicts on their emotions or on the facts? most of all, why weren't there any scenes that showed the jury deliberating and what they were really thinking after their emotions worn off. i'll tell you why. they couldn't show the delibertion because no jury could acquit a man of such a crime, no matter how much the defense's closing arguements touched their hearts. what is the message? that someone is justified in killing if it is a form of revenge for a previous crime done to them?this film should have had the courage to say that murder is not ok in this situation, because in reality, there would not be an acquittal. but since dollars were at stake, the filmmakers were more concerned about sparing the audiences' feelings than they were about presenting a responsible message. if people start killing as a form of revenge, the makers of this film should be held responsible. what a socially irresponsible film this is!

first things first - though i believe joel schumacher is at best a mediocre director and more often (as here) downright bad, the lion's share of the blame for this ugly travesty of a film must go to john grisham whose novel this is based on.set at an undetermined point in time (the 50s? the 70s? now?), the film opens with the rape and murder of a child by rednecks so caricatured that their purpose seems to be to reassure racists that "at least we're not that bad" cut to the bad guys arriving at the courthouse when the girls father, samuel l jackson, fearful they will get off on some technicality, guns them down in cold blood before the trial. the setting is a 'deep south' that probably never existed - the few black characters live in shacks and seem to pick cotton, the dyed-in-the-wool racists (kiefer sutherland is a cartoon version of a klansman) are laughable in their villainy. the set-piece is the trial: for the defence, are the "good guys" - a milquetoast lawyer played by matthew mcconaughey as though in a coma, his assistant played by sandra bullock's breasts (she doesn't seem to serve any other narrative purpose) and donald sutherland as the requisite drunk-lawyer-who-sobers-up-to-fight-the-good-fight. for the prosecution, kevin spacey goes through the motions of being demon spawn, while in the town at large, crosses are burned, witness are intimidated and the local citizens don't seem to care some of the reviews here claim the film immoral, since surely samuel jackson is a killer and should trust to the forces of the law rather than get off on a feeble heart-tugging piece of oratory by matthew mcconaughey. to be honest, objectionable though the underlying message "vigilante justice is good" might be, everything about the movie stinks: the characterizations are pitiful, the acting leaden, the direction plodding, the screenplay and the dialogue almost verging on parody. peter menzies lush, 50s technicolor cinematography is pretty but derivative. and it goes on for nearly two and a half hours!! what's left to say? this is a waste of 141 minutes of anyone's life, it is tedious, vacuous and hammy, and, almost as an afterthought, it is morally repugnant.

there are other reviews here expressing similar views, but i still feel impelled to add my comments. the film is generally well-made from a technical point of view, apart from possibly being too long. the acting is mostly very good, although kevin spacey isn't given much space to explain his character's motivation (apparently ambition rather than racism), and sandra bullock's only function seems to be as eye candy, which she admittedly manages very well.at a fundamental level the film's heart is in the right place in being opposed to racism, and i get the impression that it tried to set out to be some kind of definitive treatment of racism, perhaps why so many famous names agreed to be in it. however, it seems the writers bit off far more than they could chew (i haven't read the book, so i don't know how much of that is down to grisham). the biggest problem, as many others have said, is that it ends up advocating vigilante justice. aside from the fact that i don't agree with that position, i don't think that such a view actually helps the anti-racist cause at all - it's more likely to be applied to acquit white defendants who kill black victims. at the end the prosecutor invites the jury (and the audience) to imagine that the raped girl was white - but follow that through and imagine the defendant to be a white man who murdered black rapists ... in the end the message seems to be that it's ok to kill someone as long as you hate them enough. it's also convenient that the man killed was presented as totally evil and his guilt was in no doubt, which removes any of the moral ambiguity likely in a real case.samuel l jackson gives an excellent performance, but unfortunately this also undermines the plot - he comes across as someone with considerable integrity, but it's hard to believe that he would be willing to hide behind an insanity plea (and indeed he doesn't, when push comes to shove). we're presumably supposed to think that it's because he faces the death penalty, but in fact at one point he's offered a plea of manslaughter, although if you blink you might miss it. why not take it, given that he must know his chances of acquittal are slim? or if he wants to make a stand in court, why plead insanity?there are less serious flaws too. the medical experts, on whose testimony the case supposedly rests, are jokes - both are discredited for highly implausible reasons, and neither of them offers any real psychiatric diagnosis. the message seems to be that expert witnesses will say whatever they're asked to say, and shouldn't be believed. the fact that the injured policeman supports jackson is moderately plausible, but still a bit convenient (and what if he had died?) i find it hard to believe that the kkk would march down the street in broad daylight. other apparently serious crimes (riot, arson, kidnapping, attempted murder) go by without any visible attempt to detect or prosecute them. and the scene where the dog comes bounding back is ludicrous.my final reaction is to be left feeling rather dirty - as though i must be a racist because i disagree with the resolution. it may be that the film intended to explore different viewpoints and leave the audience to decide, but if so they seem to have forgotten it by the time they got to the end. the film did make me think about my views, read what other people thought here and add my own opinion, so at some level maybe it succeeded - but i worry that it may have re-inforced highly illiberal views in some people, which i hope is the opposite of what it intended.final thought - try watching law and order, it covers issues like this with much more depth in about 38 minutes of screen time!

a time to kill is based on john grisham's first novel, the one he wrote before he was famous, and the one that didn't skyrocket him to fame. (that would be accomplished by "the firm"). that's why this movie didn't get made until much later, after grisham was off churning out meaningless books with the movie dollar signs fresh in his head. unlike most of those, this book was actually about something. it had meat, it had weight, and it had heart.but it also had a fatal flaw, and this fatal flaw gets translated into the movie. namely, "a time to kill" sets you up.here we have a black man (jackson), on trial for the murder of two white men who brutally raped and tortured his 10-year-old daughter. we have an underdog lawyer (mcconaughey) battling the big bad system to save his client. and oh, by the way, the whole thing is set against the backdrop of racism in mississippi, complete with hooded kkk men burning crosses.in other words, we're supposed to sympathize with carl lee hailey. we're supposed to believe that a father who loves his daughter is justified in killing the men who raped her. we're supposed to feel the injustice of a system where a racist all-white jury could judge a black man who was just trying to avenge a brutal crime. we're supposed feel like we're standing alongside the people chanting "free carl lee".but the racism issue is a smokescreen, and the whole thing is contrived. carl lee hailey was a vigilante. yes, there were mitigating circumstances for what he did, but the fact remains that he wasn't innocent. this would have been true no matter what his skin colour, or the skin colour of the assailants of his daughter, the judge, the jury, or anyone else.and what's so heavy-handed about this film is that it paints anyone who believes carl lee should have been convicted is a racist. the message seems to be that if you believe that the law shouldn't be taken into people's own hands, then you might as well be burning crosses on a lawn somewhere wearing a hood.this isn't the first time a heavy dose of sentimentalism is inserted into a story like this, and it won't be the last. as a movie, a time to kill stays pretty faithful to the book, and the acting isn't half bad. but it played the hand it had been dealt, really. even a good cast can't elevate bad source material.

this is the worst kind of film.the plot is ludicrous, the characters are unrealistic stereotypes who never look like they believe it themselves. are white people such monsters that they will continue to call two white child rapists in their 20s "good boys" and need to be persuaded that this might be grounds for provocation? are black people universally inspiring? do the ku klux klan really stand outside court rooms shooting at lawyers with nobody intervening? do judges really think that a fair trial can be conducted when the jury can hear a mob outside shouting "kill him"? do black people really stand shoulder to shoulder with the klan waiting to hear the verdict? do wives really take several months to realise that their husband might be defending a man from unfair hanging because he knew might have done the same thing? do juries really acquit people of murder because they feel sorry for them? do lawyers really use a defense of sanity in order to persuade people that their client was temporarily insane? worst of all, any high-minded principles of this film were lost to the completely exploitative and gratuitous use of sexual crime to titillate the audience. was the subject of rape, let alone child gang rape, really in competent hands here? is it really a subject that belongs in hollywood hands? and if so, why the completely gratuitous kidnap and stripping of sandra bullock? and the completely pointless statutory rape charge against one of the witnesses? seems like the director didn't feel that strongly about sex crime after all.this was taking the excellent plot of to kill a mockingbird and making a crass, shallow, tasteless money-spinner from it. shame on them.

normally i would applaud a movie that tries to do something different or original in a genre. it is obvious that this movie is some sort of parody on ninja movies. and i really did my best to enjoy the movie. but i just couldn't. the jokes aren't funny enough! (i've seen my share of japanese movies. and most of the times i like and understand the humor used in those movies. "red shadow" is just silly!)the characters that are portrayed in this movie know that this isn't a serious movie and show that all is about the fun. look at the characters from parodies like "hot shots" or "scary movie". everything they do on the screen is done with a straight face and never fall out of character! and because of this, certain scenes become funny and hilarious. in "red shadow" the actors never achieve that. the shadow ninja's supposed to be very skilled and deadly. sadly the actors don't do their best in convincing us of their talents. they don't do things with a straight face. the jokes would have worked better if they did! the bad choreography of the action scenes also damaged the viewing experience for me. i like humor in martial arts movies as long as the action is good. "red shadow" just fails in that department. so what is left to be enjoyed. well,the music (techno) was uplifting. it had to be as the action it self never is exciting. and there are some short dramatic scenes that are good but simple. the use of humor,lack of story and depth make me think that this movie is meant for children. but i do wonder if children actually would like this movie. waste of time!

what can you say after watching this movie? that is, if you had the interest and concentration to see it to the end. i was left speechless, due to the amazingly dull story, annoying situations where one american equals that of a fifty or more iraqis, and boring dialogue. i think that if this movie has something to teach, it probably goes like "don't screw with us, or we'll come and kick your butts". plus, this film truly encourages and votes for killing masses of foreigners, in the name of war. i got the image of tackling chess pieces out of the playing board. except, now it's fast and there's not so much thinking. and on top of that.. no character there has any spirit; then, how can you care at all what happens to any of them. excluding war movie fans with no taste, i wouldn't recommend this to anyone. there should always be something more interesting to do.

bad sequels.....this one's a real one! when the first movie was very very bad, you have to be fool to make a sequel.....worse actors, worse scenario,worse special effects,worse movie!!! this is history! bad history! i give it 0 and a half (for laughs) out of *****.

can anyone give me a reason why only one american dies in this movie, and when he does, it is supposed to be a very emotional scene, yet when the operation delta force team kills hundreds of russians, in slow-motion action scenes, or thousands of arabs, also in slow-motion action scenes, you are supposed to cheer and say "take that, you non-american monsters!". i know i used "slow-motion action scenes" a lot, but that is because every action scene in this movie is in, you guessed it, slow-motion. every last one of them... and this squad should be called "invincible slow-motion bullet-dodging force", since they seem to have supernatural powers that help them to dodge bullets. and if this supernatural power fails, they have some kind of regeneration superpower, which is all they need to kill the complete non-american army that stands between them and victory. by this point, nobody cares since they have been put to sleep by another laughable slow-motion action scene... that is if they are not laughing out loud at the bad acting, cheesy dialogues and incredibly poor story. which is what i did... the cast is made of unknown actors, which will probably remain unknown since they don't even play characters. they are just playing guys with guns(and, lets not forget, superpowers)... the only quality is that the special effects are surprisingly not that bad(although they are in slow-motion) for a tv movie... but it still sucks... and at the same time is so bad it's good... ok, maybe at the end it gets a little too repetitive...25%

let me first off say that i am a believer of ghosts, and i do indeed know they exist. i have had enough experiences with them to know they are there.what i hate is the people who bring the bible and religion into all of this. people forget there is more than one "bible", thousands of religions and beliefs, and different ways to interpret what is said in the bible. not everyone believes in god, and not everyone believes in stereo-typical religion. religion does not make everything fact, one of the things i should mention in the bible that many do not know is that even the most rampant bible thumper is breaking the very rules written within....you are supposed to never wear more than one fabric at one time, slavery is ok, and you may murder your neighbor under certain circumstances. none of this, "oh that was the old testament, and now we have the new testament." if the bible is the word of god, and cannot be changed..there should be no changes, or versions. religion is full of misinterpretations, mixed facts, and people who so blindly follow it that there, "is no other way." the excuses these said blind followers use are either pathetic, or they themselves cannot explain the discrepancies properly, and instead use excuses handed down to them from either their pastor or teacher. but anyhow, onto the review. i am a decent fan of "ghost hunters" and when i heard this show was coming soon, i was pretty excited and thought it had some potential. as much as i like watching "ghost hunters", i do not like some of their members, and i do not like the way they can dismiss a place as being haunted, yet cannot explain anything that is going on. just because your investigation equipment does not pick it up, does not mean the camera filming the show did not. i am glad they are skeptical, but it's like they do not understand that just because you did not get anything on your recorder and film does not make the place haunted or not. if ghosts were that easy to capture, it would be known as a fact, not a belief. it's more of a "right place at the right time" kind of thing, as well as if there is something there, what makes you think it's going to "perform" for you? this show is kind of silly. it's usually boring, and there is lots of talk, lots of psychics, yet hardly anything happens. the main guy's filtered narration is usually either boring to listen to, or is basically not needed.also, the reliance on psychics is too abundant, as i believe very few of them are actually gifted. silvia brown is one i definitely believe in, but most are sometimes hard to believe.i really wanted to like this show, but of the few i have seen i have yet to be terribly impressed.

this show was rushed, and relied heavily on surprise cuts to commercials (when it came back from commercial, the noise or "surprise" was something simple like a mouse) this is a pure rip-off of ghost hunters and it attempts to go "beyond" them, and fails miserably. also, what is with the directors log thing? is this star trek? it just ruins the novelty of this show, which wore off quick. the only reason it's been watched is that people want to laugh at the pure anti-climatic nature of it. they never find anything, and most likely never will. funnily enough, they always point out something that is the thing they are "hunting" and guess what?! it's the local radio station's tower light that is blinking red!

i give this nonsense a 2 instead of a 1 because there is a worse show called haunted homes. but this kid and his buddies conduct their investigations like total idiots. they assume that there are ghosts from the get go and if they ever find rational explanations behind the experiences they have to be drug kicking and screaming into admitting it. but beyond that, the show's whole format is incredibly annoying. even though a lot of it seems scripted, the college educated kids who make up the the cast can barely speak english but still insist on trying to use "big" words they obviously don't understand. and head investigator ryan's ridiculously self important voiceovers make me just want to throw the tv through the window. (and he looks stoned all the time). in short, this group make the guys from taps on ghost hunters look like mit scientists!

even if ryan wasn't such of an annoying person, this would still be bad, i said even if, where do we begin? "directors log" you will have the urge to snatch his tape recorder and pound it with a hammer or punt it into a lake, a haunted lake of course. oh how i wish "dead time" was more literal as opposed to what they refer to it as, but alas, no death, maybe a pillow out of place or a "humming noise" oh wait thats the cat. i actually expected to see some sort of evidence or at least something to verify their escapades, don't worry you wont see anything you that you would not see on a normal day.an entire season and what do they have to show for it, um nothing. no in fact they have less than nothing, they have a waste of time. they took my challenge, the do something for the paranormal challenge. now in this you actually do something for the paranormal, you could say go on camera and say "i love the paranormal so much i'll draw stick figures of ghosts" or " i love the paranormal so much i'll film hot co-eds pretending to be ghost hunters" you would be wasting film, but wasting it for the paranormal. or you could say "i'll mess with a demon" but don't say it's name you might get hurt, and you know god doesn't like that, that would be quite a thing for god but he wouldn't like that so don't do that. so i asked them to waste time for the paranormal and they followed suit, they went into an old building looking for "mothman", it was a waste of time, it made no real difference at all, it had no effect, we learned nothing new, it was a waste of time and film.there amazing detective work is just so uncanny, "well we found your problem" a cat died here so were going to psychically communicate with that cat and tell it to move on, kind of throw some catnip at it, and it'll be ok......directors log...." captain log star date 541.2 ...oh i mean " directors log, i just brought on a few new investigators, a couple 8's and 9's but this chic is a 10....um yeah....we have a new case... strange things happening.... .......focusing on one of the children.....were going to investigate.." now we will bring is a psychic, we haven't told them anything this is tv trust us,

i am a fan of the paranormal and i love ghost hunters so when this show first came out i decided to give it a try. i could barely sit through one episode. the show is so obviously staged. i mean come on, every single episode involves someone being possessed or involves a demonic force trying to kill the family. another huge flaw is that these guys never debunk anything. when i watch ghost hunters they find evidence and try to disprove it and if they can't then it is evidence. on this show they find a voice or a piece of video evidence and they are very quick to call it a ghost. this completely ruins their credibility unlike taps and ghost hunters who actually know what they're doing. honestly if you're interested in the paranormal and want to watch a show about it watch ghost hunters.

i was very excited when paranormal state first came on a&e. i thought that it may bring some more interesting ghostly evidence. the production value looked good and i really love the logo. then, after about few episodes in, i started to feel that this show may not be looking for evidence but had a strong religious agenda.it seems like every case they investigate has some big powerful evil demon that can't even make a teacup move on camera, yet everyone is terrified. then comes some power of christ ritual that saves everyone.also, there is very little focus on other members of the team. the entire show focuses on ryan and he feels like one of those people that hands you pamphlets about his church on the street.has paranormal phenomenon and demons become the new missionaries of christianity, scaring people to convert? really, this should be on a christian network. i was very disappointed.

i was excited to see this show when i started seeing the promos on a&e. i've been fascinated with ghosts and the paranormal since i was a kid, and love catching "ghost hunters" when it's on (scifi channel). i've tried to watch three episodes of "paranormal state" and only use up my time commenting on it because it's so bad and perpetuates the notion that anyone who believes in the paranormal is a gullible freak. "paranormal state" is beyond cheesy. cheesy "director's log" voice-overs that will leave you wishing for captain kirk. cheesy teasers going into commercial breaks that are taken completely out of context. everything paranormal on this show is automatically assumed to be "evil" and the work of a demonic spirit. then come the exorcists, demonologists, psychics ... like in "poltergeist" you almost expect the team to leave and say "this house is clear." i very much appreciate the "ghost hunters" approach, where they go in to disprove claims, then take away what they can ... and they are almost always reassuring to the client (if they find anything) that haunted does not equal evil. "paranormal state" is not "so bad it's good" ... it's just plain bad. didn't a&e used to stand for "arts & entertainment"? the art part has long been gone, and the entertainment factor is now waning as well.

there really are no redeeming factors about this show. to put it simply, its just terrible. absolutely dreadful. it's just a dreadful "reality" show. not only that, it's dreadful fiction.imagine this: a bunch of overly-imaginative teenagers get together one night and go "hey! let's make a paranormal show just like "ghost hunters" and whatnot!" so they grab a camera, harass local residents and film random landscapes behind a painfully "trying-to-be-dramatic-yet-failing-misreably" monologue. this show is basically a bunch of teenagers running around with a home movie camera trying to make a really bad horror documentary. the only difference is this show actually has a budget and writers. a wasted budget and terrible writers.oh, the problems, how do i count thee? well, first off, let's talk about this from a personal level. i am not a total skeptic when it comes to the paranormal. i am willing to believe in whats paranormal and whats not, and i'm sure there are a lot of people who feel the same. so, if you're going to do a show about the paranormal, you have to do a good job convincing the viewer that what they're seeing is either paranormal or not, because the viewer can easily believe otherwise. i hate to compare, but i don't see why not at this point. take "ghost hunters" for example. in "ghost hunters" you can tell that the cast is leveled with the audience. they're not totally skeptical, yet they're still willing to keep the possibility of any paranormal anomalies in mind. they have to look at something and be willing to say "this is possible that its simply nothing". and, with that in mind, they set out to try and prove themselves wrong. they use technology and several other gadgets along with constant moderation to determine what is paranormal along with bearing the fact that what they may be monitoring could be nothing in mind. not only are they trying to convince themselves what is real and what is not, in the process they are trying to convince you. that element of doubt is not present in "paranormal state". strike one.in "paranormal state", the cast simply says "there's this spooky place, and its haunted, so we're going to find some spirits!" and immediately you know and saying to yourself "okay, convince me otherwise". the cast is not professional in their interviews. in fact, sometimes it seems like they're just harassing local residents of these so-called "haunted" areas. they have no real evidence to back up their claims besides assumptions and theories, and the best they can must up is somebody who "claims" they can contact the dead, with no one ever backing up who this person is and how valid they really are. they could have easily just picked some random person off the street and said "pretend you can contact spirits for our show" and went at it. in the "mothman" episode, this just happens. without any convincing evidence towards the end of the show, they bring this sort of individual out where he does a random, painfully scripted "reading" of a supposed area of how something is "haunted" in order to convince its audience. very, very poor effort. i feel that one of the main problems with the show is that it feels scripted. during one of the episodes, the cast gets attacked by one of these "paranormal anomalies" at times in an attempt to be dramatic. these sort of dramatic sequences would make any skeptic laugh and even those who are on the fence realize what they're watching is just a bunch of tabloid-esquire trash. if the show's aim was to try and convince their audience that these "paranormal" events are real, they're doing a horrifically poor job at doing so. strike two.however, there is always the counter. just one last viewpoint to see if the show is actually worth something. what if the show isn't trying to convince you that these paranormal events are real and are simply trying to entertain you with good fiction? it even fails on that level as well. if the show's creators were trying to craft fiction to entertain its audience, the writing is too poor and even on a fictional level, it fails to convince the audience that its cast members are really experiencing the unknown in all its full, horrifying glory. the writing is simply not compelling and even, dare i say, boring. strike three.so what remains of this show is simply a bunch of teenagers who are too willing or too gullible to believe in the paranormal simply because its simply much more amazing than reality who set out with a camera, a bad script and bad actors to generally just make a really bad horror documentary. thats all the show is at this point. there is no reason to see it, not even for the entertainment factor, and there's no reason to care about it. to be blunt, its lame. there are absolutely no redeeming factors about this show.

the atmosphere in this show is great. there's plenty of excellent buildup, but thats where this show fails. there's way to much build up for nothing. you will constantly see a creepy set up that makes it feel likes something really freaky is coming right out of the corner and then....nothing. over and over again nothing. you hear plenty of stories of people talking about freaky events but you see none. they show up at these peoples doors, talk about their deep and emotional pasts, set up lame equipment and find nothing! there is nothing on this show thats leads me to believe in anything paranormal. i laugh every time they need to exercise a "horrible spirit" that we as an audience have seen nothing of. they get rid of the spirit that never was and everything is put in a neat little package. a show that looked so freaky and had such great potential leads up to one thing...nothing!

"paranormal state" is an interesting show for most paranormal believers. i enjoy watching what the "team" has to say and what they "find", however, i know that the entire show along with it's build ups and story lines are completely set up. they go to real haunted locations and i suspect that they speak with actual witnesses. i commonly feel as i watch it that i am not watching non-fiction but an actual movie that is contradictory to reality. i personally would not advise or recommend anyone to watch this show unless you are a basic scare seeker. interesting show. stick to "ghost hunters"

this show, paranormal state, has an almost "blairwitch project" feel to it. as in, you're watching a 'documentary' that's actually just a scripted movie, made to look and feel like a documentary.my biggest problem with the show, is their 'go to' outside advisers of the warren's, who were made famous for their 'investigations' of the amityville murders, which were shown to be completely fraudulent, just based upon the police reports of the family's deaths! (such as the eldest daughter actually having been involved in the entire thing, to the point of possibly even helping with some of the deaths!) then there's the way they constantly jump to blaming demons for everything. not to mention how haughty the group is about what cases they take. they don't want to help those who need it most, they just want the weirdest cases, that will get them the most press and attention.they're complete frauds, plain and simple.

this show is absolutely ridiculous. yes, of course its fake. but it is agonizing to watch. i personally know more creative film influenced minds that could "make" this seem real. the young lead male couldn't be more unconvincing. he line-reads everything he says. are we really suppose to believe he knows what he is talking about? there is a plethora of ways to blair-witch this show up. fear does not breed from what seems "cool" and computer generated. nor does it generate from such proverbial lines as "what was that? did you hear that?" also, there are real convincing psychics out there that don't just "want to be on screen". another duh-factor is... how do these producers think we are actually going to buy that paranormal activity will just magically happen within the 2 possibly 3 days (if we are lucky) they film. i don't think so. a 2 + week at one site would be more convincing. it is also disarming that they think including "nasa radar checks" and computer's that show fancy bs really make us scared. and ie: exorcisms should not be staged like the film "the exorcist". when are they going to get it right? possession of the devil or other evil spirits influence people differently. they don't just snarl and lower their voice like linda blair or fallel around like courtney love on a drug binge. as stated better concentrations on "psychic ability" would aid this show greatly. we want to see and hear everything that supposingly flashes before them. not cut-away to other story bs. on a final note- shooting stars do not generate interest when you showed fake pictures of ufo's ahead of time. might i stress again the young dark haired man that hosts this show is absolutely down-right awful. avoid this show. for fright: watch old unsolved mystery episodes... not the new ones (the recreation got it oh-so wrong). but that is for a different blog.

it's perfectly ok that people dies in an animation, but there are just way too many death in this one. start from the very beginning, the story is all around battles, fights, death, and revenge. it goes on and on for entire one and a half hour. it was interesting at the beginning, but i grew very tire after before the show was half way through. unlike other animations, this one is lack of humor. there are not many interactions between the characters either. the good thing about it is the sword fight scene looks pretty good and the characters look nice.

well ok, i've seen wrath of the ninja.it isn't something that i would recommend to people who aren't seriously into japanese fighting movies. this is a sort of japanese fighting ninja movie, with a complex plot. it's about these 3 old ninja schools that had these 3 "swords of sorcery". i saw the subtitled version (not recommended by the way, it's easy to miss something) and i didn't really keep up with it all. it had some good scenes tough, but in general, it wasn't much to my liking.

hard up, no proper jobs going down at the pit, why not rent your kids! diy pimp story without the gratuitous sex scenes, either hard core or soft core, therefore reads like a public information film from the fifties, give this a wide miss, use a barge pole if you can.

this ultra-low budget kitchen-sink yawn is the kind of film that can only be made in the uk in that, anywhere else in the world the fact the a market would need to exist before a green-light would be given. most probably self funded this is clearly an attempt to redress important issues but ultimately undermines its point of existence in that the question needs to be begged, who would ever put money into distributing this and secondly if a market audience doesn't exist to watch, buy or rent this film, why would anyone bother in the first place? my opinions may sound unfairly harsh on a first time director but, this is the kind of film that only goes to undermine the commercial viability and quality standards which have only just kept a british film industry in existence. reviewed in edinburgh. 2 out of 10.

first of all, i just wanna say that i'm a very big naruto fan. i love the anime and the manga stories. also, the first movie just confirmed that naruto is all about great fun, great action, great story, ... but then came the 2nd movie. i was very hyped because the first movie turned out great. but it didn't satisfy me one bit... the story was lame, action wasn't all that great... especially compared to the anime series... same goes for the quality of animation. i found it very poorly... could the story get any lamer... any ??? where's the kyuubi of naruto ?? not once does he turn demon... i mean ... come on !!! my advice is... see the series ( until episode 140 , then it's just fillers ) and then read the manga because that's still great. ignore this movie and hope for something better in the future...all and all i gave it a 4, just because it's naruto...

i struggle to see the point of this movie. it is supposed to be a comedy but i didn't laugh once. the storyline is one that could have been interesting in a well made movie, but since this is acted by comics, the result is totally unbelievable (as comedies should be). the comic strip series was very hit and miss, even withing the episodes, and it is fair to say all of the people involved have gone on to do greater things. one to avoid. i have also just found out that comments have to be 10 lines long. the whole point of these comments is to give an indication of whether the movie is worth watching: not write an essay gushing about it or taking it apart. if you like: seinfeld, larry sanders, the young ones, alan partridge, arrested development, curb, red dwarf, then you might like to pass on this. on the other hand, if you like lame jokes such as can be found in friends and dodgeball, enjoy watching this!

the comic strip featured actors from 'the young one's' - a student based sitcom from the 80's. comic strip features included parodies of westerns, 'the famous 5', and the professionals - all a lot funnier than this. having said that alexei sayle puts in a good turn as a traffic cop with ambition and the soundtrack features great music from the era. 5/10

the basic story idea of enchanted april is excellent--two very unhappy wives meet and decide to pool their funds to rent an italian villa for a month. to further defray costs, they get two other strangers to come along. what makes it interesting are the relationships both before and during this vacation--in particular, showing how this beautiful setting actually changes their outlooks on life. unfortunately, this good idea is totally spoiled by two key performances in the ensemble cast that are so bad that they ruin the film. ann harding plays the most important role in the film in a manner that makes her seem ridiculous. her "doe-eyed" expression and vacant stares really make you wonder if this isn't a zombie movie or she's just meant to be an idiot! and to make it worse, reginald owen plays a character so obnoxious and bombastic that i was very close to turning off the film--he was that awful and unbelievable. i noticed that at least one reviewer gave this movie a 10--which is very, very difficult to understand. sure, the film has great ambiance and a good plot, but these two glaringly silly performances cannot be overlooked as they undermine the rest of the picture. sorry, but this film was aching for a re-make!

the 1935 version of "enchanted april" manages to be simultaneously tediousand perfunctory. it is difficult to show the transformative magic of italy shooting in a studio with only stereotypical italian behavior to belabor. the transformation of the four strangers fleeing london is instantaneous in the cut from the first day to a week later. rather than develop, the screenplay flips a switch and thecharacters are different.the husbands are boring enough in flashbacks without turning up, even if their presence does not drive the four women back into their shells and/or hostilities.jessie ralph has the most fun (moving instead of entirely chewing up thescenery) and katharine alexander has some poignant charm out of herhusband's shadow (and away from his hideous droning). ann harding isunremarkable here (with the production code being enforced). she had anappropriate line in an earlier (pre-code) movie, "when ladies meet": "you'renot worth a minute of one anxious hour that either one of us has given you," but in "enchanted april" can only look hurt, rush out, and proclaim fealty to her errant husband.

i found this to be a tremendously disappointing version of a charming story. i thought the acting was on the whole quite good. reginald owen did chew the scenery, as mentioned by others, but i found him moderately amusing in his brief scenes. tcm has made an ann harding fan of me, and i thought she was fine as usual here. jessie ralph had a field day as the old battleaxe, ordering everybody around, and frank morgan, as always, played frank morgan with a twinkle.for me, the problem was the script and/or the editing--transitions were awkward, motivations were murky. the movie was just too darned short to convey the story properly! i felt completely let down, particularly since i had such fond memories of the later version.

the artist daniel king (chris john) and his mate laura peters (lara clancy) are invited to move to an old house in cornwall, in great britain, by his childhood wealthy friend natasha carlton (carol kentish). natasha has a crush on daniel, who is an ambiguous man regarding his sentimental life. while alone in the house, weird things happen and laura is startled and scared. when laura meets the old insane priest gabriel norton (brian blessed) on the road, she is advised to immediately leave the house, since evil lived there. but the couple stays and has to face tragic consequences.what a messy screenplay and awful and cheesy movie this "devil's harvest" is! the cinematography and the camera work is not totally bad, but the amateurish performances of chris john and carol kentish and direction of james shanks, together with the terrible story, ridiculous situations and dialogs make this movie one of the worse i have ever seen in the genre. i have occasionally seen in youtube a couple of shorts from cinema college that are better and better than the pointless and dreadful "devil's harvest". in the end, it is not a horror movie but a horror of movie. my vote is three.title (brazil): "a colheita do diabo" ("the devil's harvest")

i just wanted to leave a quick comment as its not listen on here ,but i have just seen this movie,the version i just rented was released in 2005 as far as i know and it was actually called "don't go into the attic" i only realized it was the same movie as devils harvest upon searching for some of the actors who looked familiar in the movie. anyways i'm in ireland so maybe this has only been released over here and in the uk now,but thats what its called over here..........not really like it matters because i would not recommend this movie.the only words that spring to mind watching it are cheese cheese cheese!! my one mark out of ten is purely for the one little jumpy bit :o)

i loved the original p.h. and was somewhat satisfied with bloodwings (ii)and ashes to ashes (iii), then i saw part iv. oh boy..... as a pumpkinghead enthusiast, i did my best to give part 4 as much credit as i could, but it's pretty bad. the wedding reception fight right at the beginning of the film is a horrendous mess for one thing. the hatfield and mccoy storyline is incomprehensibly stupid and cliché. how did the producers get away with using that tired family feud storyline? wow, unbelievable. the acting, besides henrickson, is below average. the plot and script are mind-numbing. the actual editing and cinematography are average, as is the directing. i mean, the movie isn't a total loss. as always: i really enjoy watching pumpkinhead, i love seeing haggis the witch, and like watching harley's ghost in action. but all three characters had way too much screen time. i thought haggis and harley would wind up going out to a supper club for an evening bite to eat and drinks, the way the were being so buddy buddy in her cabin. the bottom line is.... is that i wanted all the characters in this puke fest of a plot line to be dead within 20 minutes of the start of the picture. where does sci-fi get these so called "film production professionals" from anyway!? i could do a better job writing a script stone cold drunk. i'm sure there was a limited budget and everything, but come on! see it if your a fan of the other three, but just once. and then go back and stick to the original two. shame on you sci-fi!!!!

1st watched 2/9/2008, 4 out of 10(dir-j.s. cardone): sexual political thriller that doesn't really succeed in any of these areas very well except early on where there are some interesting soft-core scenes. the movie starts off portraying a couple exploring their sexual fantasies amidst their work environments or wherever and whatever suits their fancy. the couple takes an excursion to a retreat and bathhouse where they run into a woman that's willing to be a part of a three-some and fulfill some of their fantasies. at this point, we only know that this couple is well off but we don't know until they return that the fiancé is part of a well-to-do political family. the man hopes to be on the rise to the point of possibly getting a congressional seat after the marriage. they then receive a package in the mail from an anonymous source with explicit pictures of their encounter at the bath house and their qwest begins as to how and why they were filmed, who sent the package, what they want, and how to clear their names before any of this gets out. this qwest becomes an obsession that leads them deeper into seedier worlds and takes a lot of their time, to the point where their friends & family wonder what they're doing all day and why they look rundown all the time. this movie is interesting at times but drifts into ridiculousness as they personally seek out the problem instead of getting the police involved early on because of their pride. this mistake, of course, keeps the movie going. the performances are fine despite the no-name cast but the lunacy of the situation overrides and the movie starts to become ho-hum about ½ the way through. and of course, they throw in a twist at the end that defies and challenges everything that happened prior(as is the norm these days when they don't know what else to do to spice up the movie). this doesn't help this movie one bit, though.

sure, this flick set in eastern europe is filled with sexy, but it absolutely has nothing to do with the nicholas cage flick "8mm" an ambassador's daughter and her fiancée mix it up with a local woman in a threesome that ends up being taped. the tape is used for blackmail and the stakes get higher and higher as the couple try to work it out themselves instead of going to authorities.the sex comes and goes -- and would be the only reason for renting it, i suppose if you like this sorta thing -- and is quite gratuitous towards the middle when we cruise along the porn scene looking for the "other woman." i definitely question how it got into blockbuster even with a youth restricted sticker considering how just a hint over the edge of soft core it is. (oh that's right, it's the double standard. actual art-house flicks like "the dreamers" and "y tu mama tambien" get castrated r versions, but straight to dvd crap like this get the unrated banner proudly attached. whatever.) the acting is horrible, the plot is mind numbingly unoriginal, but really the worst offense is the idea that this is a sequel to 8mm. i'd give the flick a d for a grade and be nice, but considering they tried to trick me, it gets the f it frankly deserves.

after seeing the movie in a class of mine and having a talk with the filmmaker, i found out exactly why the film bombed the way it did. the creators of the movie had no intention to call the film "8mm 2." originally, the film was called "the velvet side of hell" but was changed at the last minute by sony pictures to 8mm 2 without letting the filmmakers have any say in the matter. by doing that, it screwed them out of theatrical releases and doomed it to a straight to video release with minimal advertising.again, this is from the filmmaker's mouths, not mine, so i really can't say what is truth, and what is hype.if you look at the film as "velvet side of hell," it isn't that bad. it isn't great, but it is not god awful. it would basically just be a b-movie that likes to show boobs. but as a sequel to "8mm," the film fails terribly.

this was made in 2004 for gods sake, what happened to our state of the art special effects? what happened to our rough around the edges but still good actors? the actors in this movie were unbelievably horrible, there was one or two that weren't bad, but the rest, biggg thumbs down. couldn't stand listening to the badly written dialogue, i mean, who the heck wrote that script? please don't ever write again! special effects? don't even get me started on the special effects. surely they could have come up with better then fully fake looking green balls of light in the eye sockets. it looks so old and..lame frankly.! even the easiest thing to make look real..the teeth, they looked so fake and stupid i would almost wipe a tear from my eye in annoyance. come onnnn i cant believe this was even shown to the public.!

ok if you are looking for a fun lesbian romp. this is not the movie if you are looking for a fun movie with hot sociopathic characters (in the vane of 'cruel intentions' or 'wild things') this is not the movie if you are looking for a classic vampire lesbian seductress's movie. this is not the movie.however if you are looking to wast an hour of your life, this is your movie. it is badly written, badly directed,badly scored, badly filmed.it had bad special effects...i mean really bad special effects. i think that you can actually generate the same special effects in imovie lol.it really is a pretty bad movie.the actors were classic starlet beauties however look more like porn stars. it is shot like a soft core porn however you never get the money shot and the actors all look bored out of their brains. the 'girl on girl' scenes, which suck btw, were so lame that there hardly worth mentioning. go watch the 'almost sex scenes' on youtube cos that's the only reason you would want to watch this movie and even there not worth it.a wast of money and time!!! don't even pick it up, go watch 'cruel intentions 2' instead - same movie without the bad special effects, bad storyline,bad writing,bad dialog and bad acting. actually i might go watch it now just to purge my mind

i wasn't expecting "citizen kane" but i was hoping for some extreme guilty pleasure! the script is bad, but the school exterior shots were obviously done with the same 5 extras on the same day & the dorm exterior shots were easily shot during a hurricane.the wardrobe was swapped around so much, i hoped the wardrobe mistress had some good strong soap to wash the panties. i know the budget's time but do you think they could have bought a couple of different styles of underwear? what oversexed up vampiric hot chick would wear boy-leg panties under latex trousers? i was relieved to see one appearance of thong in the penultimate scene.good points: the actors were all *very* attractive, and the girls had natural boobs. too bad they never took the bras off.the special effects were neither effective and could only be describes as special, if they rode the short bus to the edit bay. the final scene in particular is horrifically, laughably bad.-lizzzzzzzz

i don't honestly know what legal or illegal substance they - the writers - were on when the wrote this horrid piece of tripe!the cast - sucks the plot - sucks the editing - sucks the whole premise of the movie is that a girl with psychic/telekinetic powers comes across a lesbian vampire sorority, you just have to be totally out of your head to watch even 1 minute of this.the only reason i had to watch it - it was on the here! network as part of a two-picture purchase and the movie that came on after it was the real one that i wanted to see. i fast forwarded through the whole thing and was just amazed how stupid this movie was in double speed!do not rent, buy, or watch this movie....the vampires in the movie don't suck as much as the overall movie and production does!if you want a good lesbian vampire movie - the hunger with david bowie, susan sarandon & katharine deneuve - excellent movie to watch/own/rent in place of this piece of pure sh*t

decoteau has to be one of the worst "directors" working today in any genre, and it has nothing to do with his movies usually containing homoerotism and having guys run around in their matching boxer briefs. remember... anyone in tight black underwear is satanic and evil and want to suck out your blood/soul... such deep symbolism here). i just sat through the sisterhood to give him his fair shakes, i try to watch every horror movie i can and this one had barbara (from beyond, re-animator) crampton in it (i had previously been sucked in to the world of decoteau thanks to linnea quigley, adrienne barbeau and several other actresses i like).lemme tell you what about the sisterhood... like the other reviewer pointed out, the supposed plot involves lesbian vampires on a college campus. but never has a parade of hot young babes ("actresses" if you want) running around dressed in bras, panties and bikinis been so boring. the movie has no plot, no gore, no nudity and the dialog is ridiculous and seems like they made it up as they go along. parts are put in slow-motion and repeated many times to push the running time up. about ten minutes of this one consists of characters just walking around on campus (oh, the excitement!) that looks more like a hotel resort than any college i've ever been to. and the acting is the absolute worst. the only thing these girls do well is lean forward and bend over to show off their bodies. the cast were so devoid of talent that i'd be shocked to see any of them get a one-day walk-on role on passions in the future. ditto for the guys. yeah decoteau squeezed more hot guys in underwear in this one, too... guys who should be in some k-mart brochure instead of trying to act. do these people actually have to audition or just show up in dave's office and take their clothes off? i think the answer is obvious.i am willing to give any movie a chance if 1.) it's intelligently written, well directed, original and competently acted (or hell, even ambitious and stylish)... or 2.) it is chock full of gore, nudity, assorted trashiness and/or it's unintentionally hilarious. david decoteau's movies deliver none of that and they do it on better-than-usual production values for direct-to-video flicks. what a waste! so what is the appeal, especially with the advent of porn of the soft- and hard-core variety that's easily accessible to anyone with a computer? i simply cannot answer that.decoteau is a gay horror director and could use his resources to put a unique spin on the genre. instead, he produces mind-numbing drivel without an ounce of talent or intelligence shining through. ironically, when you think about it, his films are anything but pro-gay. they actually make homosexuality seem seedy, secretive and sinister. the obviously gay characters in his films are always trying to corrupt, seduce and/or kill off the innocent, sexually-confused leads. there's no shading here to make things interesting. the protagonists are naive and seldom prove themselves to be strong, assertive or confident in who they are. i would understand this plotting if jerry falwell, fred phelps or dr. laura starting making direct-to-video horror films, but from a gay director, it just goes to show that he puts almost no thought into these beefcake cheese-fests.

pretty.pretty actresses and actors. pretty bad script. pretty frequent "let's strip to our undies" scenes. pretty fair f/x. pretty jarring location decisions (the college dorm room looks like a high-end hotel room - probably because it was shot at a hotel). pretty bland storyline. pretty awful dialog. pretty locations. pretty annoying editing, unless you like the music video flash-cut style.this one isn't a guilty pleasure - this is more an embarrassing one. if you must watch this, pick a good dance/techno album and turn the sound off on the movie - you'll see the pretty people in their pretty black undies, and probably follow the story just fine.the cast may be able to act - i doubt that anyone could look skilled given the lines/plot that they had to deal with.

what a production, what a waste of screen-time and money. here is what some european so called producer think, of a scifi movie. take former model, alexandra kamp, pair a with an us c-class actor and get one of film business most notorious producer harry a. towers. towers then finds some obscure munich based prod. house, tandem communication, rola bauer, and then mix it all up with no script whatsoever and you'll get "sumuru" - a priceless gem among the worst movies ever done! get a live people, and do something else, whatever you do, no movies please!! to top everything, producers went to south africa for filming, what you see on screen is one giant sand hole, where the "action" takes place, between extremely bad actors and extremely bad fx that any film student would do better.

i watched this out of curiosity. i enjoyed stargate sg1 and i've watched many of the other tv shows and movies that the principal characters have worked on.my expectations weren't high, so i was surprised to be so monstrously disappointed.the acting throughout is appalling, and the script is worse. zero research into the bad science that is spouted throughout the movie, or into martial arts (which several cast members engage in throughout the movie, despite clearly having no martial arts training (baton twirling does not a warrior make)) training makes the already implausible plot even less credible. the same weapon (carried by michael shanks), when shot at the side of a mountain, causes extreme damage, but when shot indoors at the wall made of wicker, creates a small fireworks effect without damaging the wicker structure - ok, i suppose michael shanks fans will be sued to seeing that in stargate sg1, where a staff weapon creates either a surface burn on a main character, or blasts a hole in a section of castle wall as required), but still... a bad cgi snake 'god' eats one of the faithful in the way a dog would eat - snakes just don't behave like that.the basic premise of an amazonian warrior cult on a distant planet is silly at best. matriarchal societies have always been based on a lack of understanding that men are required in the process of propagating the species - for instance, the picts, who didn't figure out the role of men in sexual reproduction until the ninth century - at which time, the balance of power moved from the women to the men. they carry technological weapons and demonstrate some knowledge of science - particularly of medicine, so the idea that a matriarchal society could exist with this level of scientific knowledge is based purely on the original author's wet dream. of course, the few references to stellar science made in this movie demonstrate that the author knew nothing about that either (except for a few keywords that he must have heard in other movies). still, it could have been done better - like 'she' in 1965 for instance, which showed matriarchal society with a certain reverence, far more believably, and even after 45 years it seems fresher than this fetid exercise in stupidity. marching a few women around in 'armour', pouting aggressively, and spitting out their lines like a kiddie looking for a fight in a nightclub ("come on then! i'll do ya!" style), seems to be over-simplifying the complexities of a matriarchal culture.the cultural references are so simple - 'all hail the snake mother' pretty much sums it all up. even the tiniest hamlet shows more cultural variation. there is nothing clever, thought-provoking, interesting, visually exciting, or remotely entertaining about this movie. the soundtrack is of similar quality.i can only assume that the few, overly-charitable positive reviews this movie has received are from blinkered michael shanks fans who will give a thumbs up to anything he's involved in. don't be fooled. low budgets are not a reason for a film to fail - cheap b movies can be brilliant. this isn't one of them, and there's no reason to inflict this movie on yourself.

this movie was really bad. i mean really really bad. the scenes were like from a parody and special effect sucked a lot. and it was filmed in 2003!!! i think this was a great waste of time and money and michael shanks with his 'shaggy from scooby doo' image just made me laugh. never waste your time with this picture... i really don't know what the director was thinking after seeing the final cut of this movie but the fights were so unrealistic that it hurt my eyes to look on them. the 'latex cat women' fighters were like sheep just rolling around the scenes and looking frightened around like they had no clue what to do on the scene... i think this is a beautiful example of bottom 100 picture.

rutger hower fans don't be fooled - he only plays a cameo in this movie and that's it. this movie loses an extra point for that scam. i think rutger hower has a total of about 2 very short scenes and 2 very short voice-overs.the female lead for this film is way above this poor material in looks and talent-she's great, this movie is a dog and she's wasted on it. the story is of a lawyer hoping for that partnership one day at the firm getting suckered into having to cart the boss' niece across country. they have several encounters on the road with various oddballs and that is the vehicle for a variety of skits and the dude that played napoleon dynamite is thrown in the mix as a side character for good measure.this is a road-trip where extreme circumstances put our repressed hero to the test and he slowly winds up loosening up a little bit by the end of the movie, ah isn't love grand, yadda yadda..only watch this film if you want to see a hot chick be annoying to a dork in a truck for an hour and half.

simply put this movies is without any substance whatsoever. just take my word for it and save yourself the time it is a complete dud!! i would say the characters are one dimensional but that would imply there was some sort of character development. i thought eric roberts was going to jump out any second it was so close to b-movie status. the girl from that 70's is beautiful...but unless you are a stalker type fan of hers this movie has nothing for anyone. avoid..avoid...avoidthis movie was straight to dvd for a reason...that being...it is a train wreck!!!

romantic comedy movies are definitely the most fertile genre for "bellow from average" movies and source of frustration for viewers. this one is a perfect example of this and got a place in my "top ten worst movies".history is far from creative and jokes are weak. i found no reason for a single laugh during all the movie! characters are plain and the performance of the actors and just good. history develops slowly, it's tedious and foreseeable. ending is also foreseeable and sugar-coated.this is one that movies you watch in a rainy saturday afternoon when you have nothing better to watch in my humble opinion.

if only the writer/producer/"star" had the slightest inkling of the limits of his acting range, and the way he is perceived on-screen (wearing glasses and a side-parting is not enough to make you look gawky and quirky if your face and teeth have been sculpted by various medical professionals to conform to american ideals of generic, characterless symmetry, erroneously perceived as beauty in this obsessively superficial society) he would have cast john heder as the main character instead of attempting to pull a good-will-hunting and create a vehicle to showcase his... his... well, himself.the excellent supporting cast (lord knows, they must be having problems to agree to this) is wasted in an agonising perpetual struggle to react convincingly to a main character incapable of delivering even the simplest line with appropriate intonation, and believe me, he is not short of simple lines to choose from, as the dialogue appears to have been composed by a five-year-old. ah wait... it's the same person pretending to be a writer as pretending to be an actor. it's not often that i don't see a film through to the end, but this ejaculation was irredeemable from the outset and showed no signs of improving after the first hour. excrement.

this movie had so much potential to be hilarious yet moving but fell way short of either. it had a great story line, it just was not executed as good as it could have been. the weird "hallucinations" during his sleep scenes made absolutely no sense and definitely was not needed, they made no impact nor did they enhance or lend any understanding of what was to come or happen.jon heder's character was ok but could have been expanded upon more. he played the crappy part he was given at his best. the character was funny, but again, it fell short of what could have been.mila's character was perfect and her performance was spot on.in closing, the writing was horrible and more often than not, made no sense and his hallucinations did not fit with the movie at all. this movie, with better scripting and directing, could have been a contender to national lampoon's vacation as far as funny, bad things happening to a person on a trip across america.instead, it was only worthy of a second "flush". if i would have seen this at the theater, i would have demanded my money back and boycotted the film.the only thing that this film did was waste an hour and a half of my life. it also managed to make all those involved in the movie look bad, simply because the movie was a stinker.i do not recommend this movie to anyone! ever!

rutger hauer helps along a film that basically can be summed up in the young person finding themselves category, and rather obviously so, so it needs a lot of help.the beginning holds a lot more promise, of a film that could turn into michael clayton or stranger than fiction. it's too bad because i really got hooked into the beginning. then, like the opening soundtrack, it went from great and intriguing to basically nowhere.it's fun enough with plenty of curiosities and interesting characters acted well. i'm sure that will be enough for many people. the problem is it all feels contrived and empty which, ironically, is supposed to be the main discovery for the character's self realization. not the film itself (it's not a self aware film), but that the character is supposed to recognize his own life is contrived and empty.

this movie was made because the concept translates well into a two sentence summary that can be used to lure investors. that is, the premise is interesting and sellable. i mean, i rented it based on the synopsis. the problem is there is nothing beyond the initial concept. there is no coherent plot, no fully fledged characters, no real comedy, no interesting scenery, no surprises, and no good performances (except jon herder, he does something with very little). it's as if the people who green lit this thing never read the script but only the synopsis. and if there were enough people like me, it may even have made money.to the prospective viewer: don't waste your time, there is nothing funny or interesting to see here. to the creators of the film: hey, you got your film made, so what if its not that great. most people never get to see themselves or their work up on screen.

"kicked in the head" is all about the corrigan character, a twenty something man on a quest to find himself, and his involvements with a handful of quirky characters. this thin and ambiguous story, which was written by corrigan, has a make-it-up-as-you-go feel and a screenplay which smells like an uninspired low budget indie. in spite of that and some annoying hindenburg scene interjections, the film has an off beat, quirky kind of charm which may appeal, in some small way, to people with a similar sense of humor. not for everyone, not for most, but maybe fun for some. (d+)

despite a great soundtrack and the presence of the ever amazing rappaport and woods, this is another one of those moronic comedies where new york throws itself at the hero in an effort by the writer and/or director to show what a zany place it is. yeah there's some other stuff in the movie that sucks too, but that's what's important. the trend for new york independent filmmakers seems to be "i don't need to be talented, i have new york!" okay, to be fair, the movie has its moments. the flashback bit about why the one guy is called wacky jack was pretty amusing. the script isn't a story or a plot, it's a bunch of not-good scenes tied to each other by featuring the same character.one of the worst things is that there's no motive behind what the characters do. uncle sam has the kid deliver the drugs, why? if its so important why didn't sam do it himself? then the lead character lies his ass off in scene after scene with absolutely nothing to gain from lying. the guy falls in love with a flight attendant with neither of them having any reason to fall in love. the characters are a bunch of pawns for the writer to move around to see if he can get anything zany to happen.if you're easily amused or like watching bad indie movies because they make you feel smarter than watching bad mainstream movies, watch this. if you want to see what a good light hearted crime movie looks like, watch takeshi kitano's "brother". "kicked in the head" is the perfect example of why so many people hate offbeat indie movies: a lot of them suck. and a note to the director: don't be afraid to excite, amuse, enlighten or entertain the audience now and then. being boring doesn't make you a better filmmaker than the ones who can interest me.

i for one was actually expecting this movie to be pretty good, maybe my expectations were a bit to high, but the fact is i love judd nelson. in fact he is the only reason this movie is worth watching and really his role isn't all that great. the main highlights of this film are raunchy sex scenes and boring dialog. if those are the highlights i'm sure your getting a pretty good idea of what kind of film this is. there is definitely a reason this was a made for television film. only see this one if you have nothing better to do on a friday night or just like to waste money on video rentals. save your time and rent the breakfast club!

this is the type of late-night cable flick usually associated with andrew stevens or shannon tweed. though unlike most of tweed and stevens' t&a fueled vehicles, this is lethally dull!let's cut to the chase. the real reason for watching this non-thriller is to see shannon doherty's breasts. anyone who states otherwise is a liar! however, most of her steamy sex scenes appear to be all smoke and mirrors.notice that all the shots where her head and chest show at the same time are quick peek-a-boo flashes. the frames where the camera lingers on her nude body, there's little or no face attached or she's behind a dripping, wet shower door.all you boob-watchers out there know what that means - body double!i must admit though, that the finale where doherty is bound, blindfolded and menaced with a knife, provided a certain fetishistic thrill.if you find a vhs copy anywhere, buy it! as all involved are probably too embarrassed to ever let this come out on dvd!

this is one of those movies that go out of print and are very expensive on ebay. this movie is a little-known, fairly amateurish flick that has the strong advantage of being the only movie that shannon doherty appears in multiple nude scenes (looking very seductive, i might add). it also has the minor advantage of being popular in the fetish shannon doherty and smoking fetish arenas. it's a fairly mediocre attempt at a horror/drama/whodunit movie. it tries a little misdirection, but you can see what's coming a mile away. shannon does a decent job with her role, but the woman playing her sister is straight out of amateur-night, as is shannon's husband character. avoid, unless you're one of the groups i mention above. now, let's hit ebay and see if we can unload this thing. 8)

with this film being directed by roger avery and quentin tarantino doing the screenplay i was sure this was going to be a gem. i was wrong. i don't hate this film but in no ways do i like it.i love roger avery because of his amazing direction in rules of attraction and his screenplays to pulp fiction and silent hill but he made a mistake making this. do i really need to comment on tarantino, we all know hes a genius.this movie is just set around a gang robbing a bank but fails due to silly people participating in the robberyi'm disappointed in tarantino and avery for doing this film but doesn't change my mind on how amazing they both are. everyone makes mistakes......... 3/10...........j.d seaton

who wrote this flick? an uninspired 15 year-old?could have been written by one of the kids who did the columbine shooting.totally nonsensical, not funny all, boooooooriiing...plus this: the french do not put their flag everywhere. you do not walk into a french bank and see the tricolore flag displayed like that. even on bastille day.i have nothing against the blood bath thing. it's just that none of this is either credible or funny. or parodic, or anything like that.ok, those who liked this flick will tell you i must be some type of fascist, so forget about my comment.

if you watch the documentary extra, you'll note that the director is totally inexperienced and was actually a co-worker bud of quentin tarantinos in a video store. put two and two together and you realise quentin is doing a favour for his old bud, despite the bud being rather talentless. was that harsh? well see this film and you'll realise it isn't. too slow in the beginning, too nonsensical in the middle, and too slow to end. that about sums it up. eric stolz & delpy were the only two showing some charisma. and kemp actually put in an ok performance. but the rest was real bad. one instance of plot stupidity was when "lead robber" accidentally leaves his mask off during the raid. so what happens? well the other robbers decide they may as well remove theirs too! what great thinking. the violence was relentless and insane. but not in a "cool" way. rather in a farcical way. i wondered if this was meant to be a comedy. more fool tarantino for having his good name connected to this garbage. more fool me for watching it.

another film to punish us for the crime of enjoying "pulp fiction."if you like watching people get killed by machine gun fire for an hour and a half, this'll probably fit the bill. fans of the debut episode of "aeon flux," wherein the title character slays literally thousands of seemingly faceless soldiers single-handedly, will really go for it.otherwise, it's not exactly a clever movie. in fact, all it is is an excuse for a bunch of young people to act rude and shoot people. sometimes an entire scene goes by, and the only thing that happens is, you guessed it! someone gets shot. or, to spice things up, twenty people get shot. first, they're just sitting there, the next minute, they're sitting there dead. yahoo!rough plot: a young american goes to paris (an american in paris, get it?), hires a prostitute (the ethereal julie delpy), gets in touch with some old french buddies, one of which has aids, they plan and attempt a bank heist. of course, movie convention states that no bank robberies on film go off w/o a hitch, and this hitch takes up about three-quarters of the running time (it's like "dog day afternoon" without the sidney lumet's wit, patience, or humanity). while at the bank, things go wrong (surprise!), and the parisian with aids, goes wacko with his uzi several hundred times. no spoilers here, but suffice to say that you're at such an emotional distance from these characters that it's not likely you'll care who lives and who dies by the end of the film.some have called it stylish. perhaps it is, but it's someone else's style, it's a movie that's already been done, and "killing zoe" is trapped by convention. nowhere in the course of the movie does the director (roger avary, co-winner of the "pulp fiction" screenplay oscar) do anything really original, stylish, funky, or outrageous. unless you consider the fact that no movie that has taken place inside a bank has had such a high body count, there isn't anything else to set this one apart from the multitude.

quentin tarantino's partner in crime roger avary (co-writer on "pulp fiction") ventures out on his own (q.t. goes exec. prod. this time) for this over-boiled french thriller.eric stoltz is zed, safe cracker extraordinaire who has drifted over to france from the u.s. at the request of an old friend. there he teams up with a motley crew of drugged out hippies who, with little or no planning, think they can knock off a bank vault full of gold bullion on a french national holiday.avary has reworked the robbery gone wrong theme that tarantino developed so well in "reservoir dogs", only "killing zoe" is not good enough to survive on the strength of this alone, so avary has thrown in a rather beautiful distraction. julie delpy is zoe, a student come call girl who entertains zed on his arrival in paris. a stunning distraction she certainly is, but nothing more.i guess our director wanted to add a different angle to this basic theme, but sadly the move did not help to add the depth his shallow plot so desperately needed. there was never a story in this idea, which was nothing more than that, an idea. even the surreal journey into the seedy dives of paris is uninspiring. i figure one would have to concede that there was never much of a movie in the story of a bunch of gangsters shooting each other up over a botched jewellery heist either, that is until you add intricate characters and snappy dialogue. "reservoir dogs" had it, "killing zoe" did not.stoltz's strong interpretation of the doubtful zed and jean hughes-anglade's mad portrayal of the obsessive ring leader do nothing to lift proceedings. in short, avary has unsuccessfully attempted to conjure entertainment out of nothing.friday, september 15, 1995 - astor theatre

i have seen this film 3 times. mostly because i kept thinking while watching it, "have i missed something here?". is there some reason this film was made? was it trying to say something and i just missed it? well after 3 viewings i failed to come up with an answer.i guess the worst thing i can say about any film is that it bored me, and i did not finish it. i will admit there is plenty of eye candy and fast editing and hip music to keep my attention all the way through but is that all a movie should be? i am not against extreme violence, it is almost non-stop, but it seems there should be some sort of inspiration. something that is highlighted by it. the word gratuitous comes to mind but it is worse then that somehow. in the first part of the film we are all given insights into the motivations of the characters. and yes the 3 principles are very good in their roles. but the roles are completely unbelievable. so in the first part we get to know the characters, and in the second part most of em die and use sadistic glee in killing others. that seems to be the whole movie. and the first part has nothing to do with the second.for example. how could a nice smart guy like zed agree to join a bunch of junkies and amateurs to do a job like this? it makes no sense. he is portrayed as smart, yet he goes ahead with this suicide mission. the fact that he survives is totally inconsistent with the rest of the hyper-real violence and mayhem. so what are we watching here a hollywood romance with a happy ending or a super real, super violent blood bath? i recall having the same reaction to two other films this director was involved with: true romance and reservior dogs.needless dreck!

what an atrocity. i am not one to demand total verisimilitude from a movie, but the plot and screenplay of "killing zoe" are so artless that i found myself wincing through the entire (mercifully short) ninety minutes of the film.readers of these reviews will by now have figured out the plot: zoe, a call girl who falls in love with american safecracker zed, is also an employee at the bank that zed will help rob in a high-stakes bastille day heist.the film strains one's credibility from the get-go. zed and zoe's night of magic is highly prosaic, and zoe's claims to have experienced the orgasm of a lifetime would seem to reflect the screenwriter's lingering teenage fantasies more than any actual on-screen chemistry. zed's complete indifference when his friend eric throws zoe out of the hotel room hardly sets the stage for their later strong attachment.in act two, eric's band of bohemians--drug-addled losers leading a marginal life of petty crime--prepare for their big heist with a night on the town. here roger avary's main goal seems to be to prove that he knows something about drugs. a secondary thread involves convincing us (by endless repetition) that eric is really, really glad to see his old friend zed again. really glad. eric's devil-may-care, over-the-top flamboyance and affection for zed isn't even remotely believable--check out, for example, his phony bemusement at discovering a dead cat in his apartment building. development of the characters who will accompany us through the rest of the film is an afterthought.the heist is a disaster--understandable, since the plan is laughable and the criminals are complete amateurs. this is where avary continues to pay tribute to his idol quentin tarantino by showing that he can be more violent than violent. in reality, though, he's just more boring than boring. to build up the excitement, there is an extra security guard hidden inside the main safe. this was boring in video games, and it's boring now.zoe is taken hostage during the heist but despite our expectation that she'll play a pivotal role, she just sits pretty. or more precisely, avary fails to do anything with her. in literally the last five minutes she springs to life, breaks the hostage situation and saves the grateful, but still dazed zed from suffering any consequences of his crime. why she doesn't mind his involvement in the crime--or why she gives a damn about him at all--is impossible to tell. after all, she's had no chance to see that he's any more decent than the rest of the gang.throughout, the dialogue is stilted and phony. much of it is in french. as a native speaker, i can certify that it doesn't ring even remotely true. eric's sugary-sweet discourse, rapidly alternating with tough-guy boasting, is meant to be at turns charming and scary, but is instead just grating. meanwhile his scaredy-cat accomplices are more scooby-doo than thomas crown. when eric is gunned down in a ludicrous example of excessive force, we can all breathe a sigh of relief: like the bank hostages, we will soon be freed from this miserable ordeal.

let freedom ring was probably made with the best of intentions, but it sends out a curious mixed message in the final product.the folks at a western town where the railroad is coming through are overwhelmed by the arrival of immigrant railroad workers, working on the railroad being financed by robber baron edward arnold. there are a few ranchers and farmers whose land stands in the railroad's path and these folks are dealt with summarily by arnold's hired men. one man who won't give in is lionel barrymore whose son is coming home from harvard a lawyer and ready to take up the rancher's cause.only nelson eddy decides the best way to fight is to go zorro on the bad guys. but other than charles butterworth no one knows he's the wasp (a very interesting choice of names by the way). what arnold's done is used the tried and true methods of the political bosses of the east, getting the immigrants to vote. nelson's idea is simple, if the immigrants only knew the truth about what a bad guy arnold is, they'll vote with the original settlers and knock out the alien urban political machine in their midst. he kidnaps newspaper editor raymond walburn and takes him and the press to a mountain cave where some subversive newspapers are printed and distributed.the railroad workers are a real mixed bunch of immigrants, not the irish working west or the chinese working east as history has it. it's a real united nations working on arnold's railroad. the workers are kept in line by foreman victor mclaglen and nelson has the unenviable task of beating some sense into him like john wayne did in the quiet man.of all the films that starred jeanette and nelson and they certainly have come down in history as a duo, this was the worst of what they did at mgm. nelson is about to be hanged along with barrymore for crimes that are undefined at best, but certainly nothing worth being hung for. and virginia bruce who plays the nelson's girlfriend saves the day with a rendition of my country tis of thee that the immigrants join in with. in the face of a revolt by his paid for immigrant voters, arnold quite rationally packs up and leaves town to build his railroad somewhere else.i kid you not, that's the ending here. just what is the message, vote with the settlers and lose your jobs with arnold? but somehow you'll get by here? i do wonder some times if 20 years from after the incidents of this film take place and the town as settled into a sleepy backwater of the west while some towns where the railroad has come through that are now cities, that the good citizens of that town haven't rethought about what nelson eddy did. if they did they're probably running him out on a rail.nelson is of course in good voice and has a variety of concert and popular pieces to sing including a ballad to the immigrants written by sigmund romberg, where else but here. the song is a heartfelt tribute from an immigrant who did make good in his adopted country. too bad it didn't have a better venue.the almost platinum blonde virginia bruce i'm sure is dubbed here. and i'm sure jeanette macdonald was just as happy she wasn't accompanying nelson on this trip west.

famous as the british film so bad it had to be given away for free with a newspaper, the quality of this sub-children's film foundation "thriller" can be guessed from the abnormal number of 10/10 votes it gets and the large number of rave reviews from posters with no posting history and no other reviews to their name. the regulars know what this mean, the gullible might be conned. if they do dip into the waters of this one they won't last long before it drags them under. technically inept with the boom mike getting into shot or the reflections of the crew visible it just goes on forever in a forgetful sub-davinci code on $5 a day way. the end is just insulting but don't worry. it's not as if you'll get that far!

spoilers follow - and i haven't even seen it.let me guess... the murder is related to the evil property developer wanting to develop the riverside, and dickens was murdered because he was trying to uncover a similar dastardly plot. if anybody who's seen it could let me know if i'm half right, you'll have saved me the time it might take to watch something worthwhile and the rest of us will know to steer clear of both this film and its enthusiastic reviewers. on the other hand, it *sounds* intriguing; but if it was any good would it *really* be given away with a sunday rag? and what sort of track record does foley have anyway?...so, as a public service, i managed to sit through it. it's worse than 'swept away'. really. i've read stories by eight-year-olds with more drama than this. truly awful. and i was half right.

the riddle was written and directed by brendan foley in what appears to be an attempt to pull the mysteries of the charles dickens' novels into a contemporary story, but that attempt is thwarted by electing to use the two periods of time format in which the 'riddle' is unraveled. despite a cast of well-known actors, trying their best to pull off this direct to dvd movie, the end product is a long, tedious, amateurish mess that can only be considered as entertainment if viewers are fans of the cast as remembered from other films. mike sullivan (vinnie jones) is a journalist confined to reporting on dog racing events while he dreams of important reporting assignments. a series of similar murders happens to include an old friend of mike's - sadie (vera day) who runs a pub on the banks of the thames, having just discovered an old valuable unpublished manuscript by charles dickens, and has a heart of gold, giving sandwiches away to such pathetic creatures as an old tramp beachcomber (derek jacobi). sadie's murder attracts mike to the role of detective journalism and with the help of policewoman kate (julie cox) he begins to tie the investigation to clues he finds in reading the dickens manuscript. disrupting the flow of this rather simplistic story is the use of flashbacks to dickens' time as dickens (again derek jacobi) narrates a rather personal story of peculiar murders. the parallel between stories and the cross casting among actors may have worked in another's hands, but the finessing of this kind of venture escapes writer/director brendan foley. he draws his story to a close (at long last) with a tired hollywoodesque ending. in addition to jones, jacobi, cox, and day, the film somehow attracted the attention of vanessa redgrave, jason flemyng, ph moriarty and mel smith: their contributions are minimal but happily distracting. this is a flimsy bit of treacle leaving the viewer wondering how films of this quality ever find funding. grady harp

star rating: ***** saturday night **** friday night *** friday morning ** sunday night * monday morning unorthodox journalist mike sullivan (vinnie jones) flits away his time winding up the local constabulary and trying to romance a member of police personnel. but everything changes when the landlady of the thames side pub he frequents is found murdered and a transcript of an unpublished novel cum confession by legendary writer charles dickens is found. as he digs deeper into both mysteries, he is plunged further into mystery and danger than he bargained for.in 1998, former footballer vinnie jones shot out of nowhere and took everyone by surprise with his gangster cult classic lock, stock and two smoking barrels. okay, no one was blown away by his acting ability, but his presence as a hard man looked set to ensure a decent career as a movie tough guy. but it all proved to be a one hit wonder, and all he really achieved after this was supporting role status amongst far more acclaimed actors in films like gone in sixty seconds and swordfish, before descending into the realm of straight to dvd hell, the latest being this muddled and labourous thriller, which might have been okay had he not taken other acclaimed and promising new talent stars like derek jacobi, julie cox, vanessa redgrave, jason flemyng and mel smith along with him. what caused him to fall from the dizzying heights of success so quickly (apart from maybe being a one trick pony) is anyone's guess (a dodgy personal life being a possible guess) but here he is.a script as far fetched and incomprehensible as this would have been a task in anyone's hand, but with a miscast looking jones in the lead, it's even more of a task to fathom. jacobi's juxtaposing roles as a former thesp tramp and dickens himself talking directly to the camera through-out are obviously hints building up to something and the script is predictable in other areas too. add to this cheap looking production values through out and debut director (also writer) brendan foley has made a bad first impression.what exactly did i expect with something that came free with the daily mail? *

this film was pure trash. not the worse film ever. if it were to be broken down, the acting was good enough to get the job done but the script was so out there and so stupid that one was left thinking, "where did my life go?" even vanessa redgrave~ whom i love (and is the reason i watched this) was wasted. utterly wasted. she didn't even leave an impression. the directing was so distant that non of the characters left me much of anything, but to see redgrave leave nothing. her part was nothing. she was good as a mean boss but that was it. do depth and she's given depth to small roles~ see venus and atonement. i would not waste my time and was upset to have spent the $5 on this movie...i wanted it back. no returns. skip the film. it'll only bring you grief...and boredom.

this movie must have looked when it was being pitched at development stage and getting a redgrave and a jacobi on board must have excited the money men. all i can say is that they clearly did not have anything on that week. jacobi camps it up in the way that only jacobi can do and i thought that he seemed to more of the actor that he parodied in his cameo role in frasier a few years back. vinnie jones is not exactly bad, he is just clearly out of his depth as a leading man. he is really quite amiable throughout and if this was a pilot for a tv series, it may have just got picked up. however, the scipt and the camera work were appalling. quite why this "jounalist" and a press officer from the met would ever work together is never explained. it certainly cannot have been because of the sexual chemistry, of which there is none. there is nothing wrong with a ridiculous and far fetched plot that you can pass off as original, but the whole thing is just so contrived that the two stories just do not make sense at all. it was like two stories confusingly edited in to one just to make up two hours. go watch some paint dry for a couple of hours. you life will be more fulfilled than watching this rubbish

what a shame that some good talent was wasted. this is a tedious and overly self-conscious movie, that could tell its story in half the time. is that derek jacobi under that beard doing two roles? gosh, who would have guessed.the emotional payoff a the end was weak and unsatisfying. certainly not worth enduring the padded length of the movie for. i felt quite let down.the sound was dreadful. first, they used stock music. second, it was so loud during some of the dialog, that the words were hard to make out. only three sound crew, and a trainee? there were more people listed in the credits for either the accounting or the legal.some of the camera work was quite good though, and the actors did a good job with a mediocre script.not a good use of viewing time, at least for me.

the growth of tax funds and sale-and-leaseback schemes has led to a raft of unsaleable films that are gathering dust in laboratories and vaults all over the british isles because they seem to be made purely because they fit the financial criteria rather than had any potential audience. a lucky few get a week at a small screen in london before going to budget dvd, but the riddle distinguished itself by completely bypassing cinema, tv or even the rental market to premiere as a free gift dvd in the mail on sunday.it's all too easy to see why this ended up being literally given away. aside from a couple of glitches (a boom mike is clearly visible in one shot) it's not particularly badly made, and while vinnie jones comes over like modern british cinema's version of freddie mills mills as the greyhound reporter who wants to move up to the crime desk and the supporting cast veer from ham to vaguely passable, nobody's distinguishing themselves here by being either outstandingly good or outstandingly bad: mediocrity is more the norm here. the real problem is that like so many sale-and-leaseback tax fund films, it's a 'soft' film - there's no reason to watch it. it exists because the circumstances existed for it to be made, but it lacks pace or forward momentum. it seems to be aiming for the sunday teatime telly audience (despite being shot in scope) but doesn't cut it. there are a couple of okayish ideas in this determinedly inoffensive tale of a unpublished charles dickens manuscript and a couple of suspicious deaths in modern-day limehouse, but the mystery element is so painfully obvious - as is the last-minute supernatural twist (you'll never guess who jacobi's literate tramp really is. what, you guessed?) - that you're almost expecting the scooby gang or the double deckers to turn up to solve it.it's a very misconceived film for all kinds of reasons: a few cast members are playing double roles when they shouldn't even be playing one, and the whole shock reveal of the truth of the dickens manuscript is completely bungled because it's all narrated in the first person by dickens rather than the supposed character of the novel. the main murder in the film is clumsily integrated into the main plot, with characters suddenly reminding vinnie that he's forgotten about that one already, heralding an increasingly desperate final half hour that sees wicked developer jason flemyng's secretary puts some rohypnol in vinnie's drink so she can have her wicked way with him and leave incriminating photos behind "to make you look a git with your girlfriend," leading to him having a dream where he talks to charles dickens ("you're charles dickings" "what's in a name?"), who offers the somewhat less than likely suggestion that "you read too many books." but all that's as nothing compared to the finale, which falls into utter absurdity, with logic and common sense going completely out the window as it plays like some bizarre jacobean revenge tragedy with handguns on the banks of the thames, with two-day guest stars flemyng and vanessa redgrave looking like they'd much rather be somewhere else (mel smith turns up in a one-day cameo, so it's clear that the film's 'names' are mainly there for an easy $10k or to meet their alimony payments). the film's final image is so utterly absurd and pointless as to almost make it worth watching, though.one curiosity is a fairly prominent role in the first third for vera day, a sort of prototype liz fraser and one-time mainstay of 50s british films - the barmaid in hell drivers, the barmaid in quatermass ii - here promoted to pub owner, while standup comedian kenny lynch turns up briefly to give the best performance as an old school gangster. oh, and the late gareth hunt makes his last bow as - oh the irony - a coroner...just to round out the package, the freebie dvd also included a trailer for the director's other film with vinnie jones, bog bodies, a naff-looking british horror with transatlantic scientists and vinnie in elmer fudd duck hunter outfit terrorized by a reanimated 2000-year old sacrificial victim from the nearest peat bog ("be wewwy, wewwy qwuiet: i'm hunting dwuids"). i can hardly wait...the one thing i can guarantee, however, is that every indie producer in the uk is going to spend the next few weeks trying to find out exactly how much the mail paid for the license to press the dvd (they paid prince £250,000 for his new cd). with so many british tax-shelter indies on the shelf and with money so hard to find at the moment, this could become an interesting fallback market for british flicks.

ever notice how so many really bad films attract so many 10/10 votes? not much of a riddle how that happens, but this is not much of a film. there are two ways of looking at it being given away in the mail on sunday.1. it's free, so you can't complain about it to much. 2. it's free, so it can't be much good.my vote is number 2. the free dvd in the sunday papers things is a recent trend and some great old movies have been given away. they're ones that have been out for ages and have made most of the money they'll ever make, so it's a case of anything else is a bonus. it's the last stop for old films, not the first for new ones, so you can guess how bad this must be to skip tv and dvd rental.the plus points are that vinnie jones does try hard and derek jacobi is good as dickens. the minus points are a longer list. trying isn't the same as succeeding for poor vinnie and jacobi's other tramp character is talkative ham that's gone off. the story is very weak. the dickens story does not have anything to do with the film's murders and feels like another movie slapped onto the script to make people think it's a british dan brown without the religion. the supporting cast are either there for the money (vanessa redgrave must be really hard up) or because they are friends or girlfriends of the filmmakers. it is also very, very long for what it is.vinnie taking his priceless dickens story with him in his jacket pocket everywhere is good for a couple of laughs, but that's it. not funny and very not good even for free.

a pretty awful film, i'm amazed the likes of derek jacobi & vanessa redgrave agreed to be in it, it's like an overlong episode from a poor tv detective series. the biggest flaw has to be vinnie jones, he simply can't act, whoever had the bright idea of casting him as a leading man wants their head examining unless he put his own money into the project? he should stick to playing thugs, looking menacing & not speaking! also was central heating around in dickens times as there were three big radiators behind his desk??no wonder they gave this away free with a newspaper as no one would pay to see it.

words fail me for this appalling waste of two hours of anyone's life. the story is contrived to the point of complete incredibility. the acting is leaden and so much of this is laughably dreadful. vinnie jones - so wonderful in lock stock and two smoking barrels, is unbearably awful and unbelievable as mike sullivan, journalist.i honestly can't ever remember seeing a worse film. it's only worth watching for the appalling continuity lapses. after jones is handed a huge beating he emerges without a scratch on him. his girlfriend upends a drink over him and he chases her, emerging from the pub bone dry. it's quite dreadful, made all the worse by the talented actors who appear in it.

what more can i add? this is without doubt one of the worst films i've ever seen. terrible acting, a daft script, tediously slow pace - even visible microphones dangling from the top of the screen. i could go on, but i really can't be bothered. i watched this for 90 minutes before the sense of losing the will to live became too great for me.i can only assume that the first set of comments and votes were from people associated with the promotion of this insult to british film-making.and worst still, i had to buy the mail on sunday to get it :-) the only reason the dvd hasn't now been redeployed as a coaster is that it now takes pride of place in my top 10 worst films ever collection.definitely one to be avoided.

well, i got and saw this movie based on the rather high score here (7.1 now), and some of the good reviews. usually imdb is a good guide when it comes to score, though in this case i was very much deceived.the movie is a present-day detective story, with vinnie jones as the investigator journalist, who investigates the death of a construction worker. mixed with this is a made up dickens' novel (called the riddle, set in the 18th or 19th century), which also deals with a murder story. both story lines are connected through the discovery of an unpublished manuscript.sounds interesting? it could have been, however this movie horribly fails in a number of areas : 1) acting. mediocre at best, but it is watchable. no worse than your average uk sitcom, though for a movie one expects a little better. especially with a score of over 7. 2) music. the music used is simply horrible, it distracts and it is annoying. especially the pub music, and the music which plays in the journalist's apartment. 3) storyline. this is a big joke. there are gaping plot holes everywhere and even the obligatory love story is so unrealistic that it's almost funny. furthermore, without going into any detail, i can safely say that the ending is absurd, and one of the worst pieces of acting and storyline of the year. 4) camera-work. at times camera positions and views are distracting, and serve absolutely no purpose to the "story".i'm a bit of a movie fanatic, and watch on average 1 to 2 movies a day, but this is easily the worst movie i've seen in months. don't waste your money or your time on this rubbish.

flatland is one of my favorite books, thus i was looking forward to this film. unfortunately, the film is absolutely horrible. the dialog is so bad it sounds like improv half the time. the new storyline makes me think they took the book and a couple of newspapers, threw them in a blender and used what came out for the screenplay. it's a disgrace to the book and independent film making. the only reason i even managed to get all the way through the film was my hopes that it'd get better. unfortunately, it only got worse, climaxing in a really retarded ending.that's not to say everything about the movie is bad. the cg is acceptable, in a 1990's "reboot" sort of way which i assume is what they were going for. and i suppose you can't go wrong with "people" getting chopped in half and gushing blood all over the place.

nickelodeon has gone down the toilet. they have kids saying things like "oh my god!" and "we're screwed"this show promotes hate for people who aren't good looking, or aren't in the in crowd. it say that sexual promiscuity is alright, by having girls slobbering over shirtless boys. not to mention the overweight boy who takes off his shirt. the main characters basically shun anyone out of the ordinary. carly's friend sam, who may be a lesbian, beats the snot out of anybody that crosses her path, which says it's alright to be a b**ch. this show has so much negativity in it that nobody should watch it! i give it a 0 out of 10!!!

miranda cosgrove is known for her debut in "school of rock" with jack black and her role as megan in the show "drake and josh" and she has become a fan favorite amongst the nickelodeon public, so it isn't a surprise that dan schneider would create a show just for her. unfortunately, it ends up being as bad as, if not worse than, "the amanda show"."icarly" is about three friends, carly, sam, and freddie, who have become idols in the junior high community through a webcam show called "icarly". carly and sam are the hosts and freddie shoots and puts it up on the internet. carly also has an older brother named spencer, acted by the hilarious jerry trainor who is known for his work in "drake and josh" as crazy steve.well, let me tell you this. don't believe the 8.3 out of 10 this show received because it is pathetic in nearly every aspect. dan schneider probably went through about 5 minutes of studying teenage interests because all i see is him saying "ipod? iphone? ihome? aha! teenagers love anything beginning with 'i'!" and a majority of gigs that were used in "drake and josh", if not, then they are just really dry and forced jokes that don't even count on a generousity chuckle, such as "you want me to turn up the ac to 60 degrees?" "no. we want you to turn it up to 60 pickles!" not only that, but if you look closely, nearly all the sets in the shows were used in "drake and josh" and "ned's declassified" that were simply spit-and-polished with random stuff to try and make it look different.the scenes where the show is showing a broadcast of the icarly network is just as terrible as the entire series itself. the dialogue in them is atrociously bad, which may be accepted by some since it is just two friends playing around in front of a camera, but what's the deal with the really odd, humorless antics they do like "random dancing!"? and it just gets worse from there.in terms of acting, miranda and jennette aren't at their best, by far. nathan kress, who played freddie, isn't believable at times, but he does an okay job. the person who really steals the show is the humorous prowess of jerry trainor, who fits in his "protective older brother" role very well and his wide-eyed loud-mouthed acting can make for some pretty funny segments. too bad they aren't frequent, because that might have given the show an extra star in my opinion.dan schneider must have made this show for the sole purpose of giving miranda cosgrove her own cable-born playground to hop around and spew unfunny jokes and pathetic cue-card lines in every direction, because everyone else has exceptional talent buried underneath the poorly-done script and weightless acting. dan schneider did a great job with "drake and josh" so it's a real disappointment that "icarly" is such a failure. jerry trainor's acting saved this show from a 1 out of 10 rating, but he alone can't save "icarly" from being as horrible as it is.

icarly is all that's wrong with the world. all the main characters but carly's brother and freddy are morally bankrupt.sam damages other people on whim. she breaks a kids locker and he is forced to pay a 100 dollars to fix it, and all she says is "tough luck" and moves on to smash freddy's cellphone. she just caused at least 300 dollars worth of damage and she is more focused on getting some food. what the hell?. the only time she's every felt guilt is when she made fun of freddy on the show. and that's only cause carly nagged the crap out of her.carly is the "i'm perfect, everything i do is nice." type of girl. everything she does is for her own benefit and she is often shown only having remorse for herself. what's worse, she encourages sam's crap. sam ruins some of freddy's clothes? she laughs. sam ruins a kids grades? she shrugs it off.don't even get me started on the humour. the laugh track is played at every moment.sam: he's not that hot carly: yes he is sam: yeah you're right *insane amount of laughter*the shows humour consists around degrading others and saying obscure words and occasionally bantering on about trivial matters using similar sentences.not to mention all the 'super cool special techno effects' they do can be done in windows movie maker.

nickelodeon has gone down the toilet. they have kids saying things like "oh my god!" and "we're screwed"this show promotes hate for people who aren't good looking, or aren't in the in crowd. it say that sexual promiscuity is alright, by having girls slobbering over shirtless boys. not to mention the overweight boy who takes off his shirt. the main characters basically shun anyone out of the ordinary. carly's friend sam, who may be a lesbian, beats the snot out of anybody that crosses her path, which says it's alright to be a b**ch. this show has so much negativity in it that nobody should watch it! i give it a 0 out of 10!!!

first off... i have to say acting isn't very good. miranda cosgrove is the main character but is not such a good actress quite frankly. spencer, her brother is a way much better actor. spencer is easily my favorite character because he probably is the only one that knows how to act. carly on the other hand tries to act her heart out but... sorry, it just isn't good. sam doesn't even get credit, i mean come on... icarly... pretty self centered eh? freddy isn't bad, i don't have a comment. i must add that carly and her puppet sam change their attitude whenever they go to film a web cast, they go shouting out all their lines.it's sorta bad influence in a way because carly has a web show and if kids will copy this, they might be giving their own information and that not pretty safe.the only nice things is that it has some funny parts of the show which makes it entertaining. at least this show isn't boring, it has nice plots, pretty strong. many kids will like this because they don't look for flaws.overall this is a bad show but it's not boring.

first of all, i'd like to say i am a teenager so this is all marketed towards me, and i can safely say that icarly very poor programing, and the fact that it's accepted among both genders baffles me. it contains some of the worst attempts at comedy i've ever witnessed with mediocre acting to boot. the supposed humor within the show is all based on saying someone's lines again with poor sarcasm, poor sarcasm, saying bad one-liners, and, well, you get the picture. also, i should mention that i do still watch spongebob, which i know i'll get a negative backlash for, but that's quality programming with some honestly funny moments in it, less we forget something icarly's missing; wit. the show's about a young girl, carly, putting on a web-show with her friends, which i can say is without a doubt a nicer version of the internet. that's fine, but the show's just...well, not funny at all, as previously stated. if this is what children's programming has come to today, parents, show them something that's actually funny; spongebob or rocco's modern life would work.also, compared to it's brothering show, drake & josh, it's terrible, which was implied. seriously, please watch something worthwhile. even for a children's show it's poor.

nickelodeon has gone down the toilet. they have kids saying things like "oh my god!" and "we're screwed"this show promotes hate for people who aren't good looking, or aren't in the in crowd. it say that sexual promiscuity is alright, by having girls slobbering over shirtless boys. not to mention the overweight boy who takes off his shirt. the main characters basically shun anyone out of the ordinary. carly's friend sam, who may be a lesbian, beats the snot out of anybody that crosses her path, which says it's alright to be a b**ch. this show has so much negativity in it that nobody should watch it! i give it a 0 out of 10!!!

the actresses bra in a changing room--well i guess they are preparing young children for changing room time? (boys you must close your eyes at that scene a humongous bra (34c which definitely neither of the actresses size) dangling and supposedly talking--oh don't worry if your son takes your bra then stripping boys (a girl pulls down a boys pants) to reveal his boxers--kids try that at home and in school beating a girl with male briefs--nothing wrong. the show likes to show underwear--panties next?? actress--at an age below 18 in a revealing bikini--mom can you buy me one when i reach puberty? so many sexual innuendos to learn:eg: "don't doubt my ball skills.""i like to dance. with my shirt off.""wet and sticky is very icky. sticky and wet make mommy upset.""i just wanna stick my face in this pie and go 'bbbbbbuuuub.'""i come up with my best ideas when i'm wet.""he sliced my banana!""come on boy, let's do it"you'll never guess where i found this fish""i'll leave you two to do..it""carly (about sam): she just ditched icarly to go play with jonah?!""you won't get respect if your back's not erect.""how's it hanging""what can i say, i'm a great ball handler""watch me spank your daddy!"spencer: that's big. freddie's mom: thank you"hey! could you keep your hands off my equipment?"freddie: oh, and last night, slept with my socks on. sam or carly: so? freddie: just my socks"they wanted no part of me or my fudgeballs""freddie, you know how i feel about you handling tools!""you don't even wanna know where the batteries go""it's like she stuffs waffle cones in her bra!"spencer: "well, it spread...to places." freddie: "where?" *spencer motions for freddie to come near, then whispers in his ear.* freddie: "ugh!""wow, it's just that you've always seemed . . . so willing.""i have to take my daughter to a special doctor""i send a lot of guys, a lot of places""yeah, you've been having all kinds of fun this morning.""i'm looking for some 'cheap entertainment'..." (mom i learn how to say **** indirectly today!!) all in all very educational for young children. lesson to be taken: if you want to know more than where babies come from kids, watch this show!!!

first off acting is so terrible except for the actor who plays spencer. mirinda cosgrove does not deserve her own show she should have stick with drake and josh.the only person i like besides spencer is nevel hes super bad@$$ he kicked carlys crews @$$ and i liked itthe episode i hate a lot is imyourbigesstfan i hate that young icaly fan she made me almost kill myself fake is a well word to describe this please don't watch this nothing on tv is good go with classics like family matters good show ban icarly lets all go back to doug nick version only please don't watch i hate icarly oh also nathan kress is a wannabee fredie highmore

the first time i watched this show it was ok. there were some funny moments and i laughed a couple of times but this show is getting worse and worse. carly and sam's web show is not the least bit funny. they play a stupid video from the internet, scream at the camera and make some very bad jokes. and then the laugh track goes off?! one problem with the show is that none of the main characters are funny. carly is not funny. miranda cosgrove's acting is lackluster at best. her acting in this show is nothing like her acting from drake and josh. her friend sam is very rude and crude and the show is written in a way that makes her look like some kind of hillbilly. i mean they make jokes about her mom driving a rusty old truck, her mom smashing an old tv with a bat, and then there's the jokes about sam failing in school, getting detention all the time and running from cops. none of that is funny at all. then there's freddy who is a computer geek. he isn't too funny unless his mom is treating him like a baby. the show's only somewhat funny full time character is carly's brother spencer. he makes some funny jokes and does some pretty funny things like pretending to drive a space ship while making spaceship noises, knocking over a girl scouts' cookie table for revenge as they did the same thing to him. his material is the only thing worth laughing at. aside from the characters other things make the show bad too. like the fact that a couple of kids doing a local web show from a seattle apartment is a worldwide hit and got them a free trip to tokyo? another thing is that how can a 26 year old single guy with no real job can pay for a 2 level apartment in downtown seattle and raise his 13 year old sister and pay for a room full of camera and sound equipment including a remote controlled projector and a green screen and an hd camera? this sounds like it was written by a 10 year old. the worst thing is that the show contains some pretty questionable content. there are a couple of times when carly(remember a 13 year old girl) appears on her internet web show in a bikini top. wtf? then i saw an episode where freddy tells carly and sam that he "slept in just his socks the night before." i mean wtf? then there's an episode where carly's rival nevel blackmails her by taking her website rights and agrees to give her the website back in exchange for a kiss. creepy! and i just saw an episode where carly meets a boy who just moved into their apartment building and he has some kind of back injury and he takes off his shirt and carly stands there drooling over him. i can't believe nick even lets them show that kind off stuff and i can't believe that this was created by the same guy responsible for drake and josh. this show is not appropriate for kids under the age of 12 and that's even questionable. icarly is just another addition to the long list of awful nick programming.

icarly is about a teenage girl named carly shay (miranda cosgrove) who lives with her artist brother, spencer in a loft in seattle. carly has a web show that gets millions of views and makes tons of money a year, so much money she "doesn't even know its a real number". her best friend is sam (janette mccrudy) who's as predictable as they come! she says "normal" things and beats up carly's neighbor, freddie who is in charge of all the technical things for their web show. carly shouts every word and looks like she doesn't have emotion. sam chases freddie around and freddie screams. in one episode carly and her friends shoot lewbert (the doorman) down in elevator and he survives.i would not recommend this at all, unless you like teenagers shouting, hurting people and making fun of stuff.

ever went on youtube? well, the definite question to that is yes. do you see the boatloads of icarly and nickelodeon rants? no definite answer.many people think icarly is a dull and idiotic program, and others think it's the best program on the face of the earth. i have seen many of the loads of reviews panning icarly in the head and some giving it a bouquet of roses. in my opinion, icarly is for the kiddies, but the show is just awful.if you did not read the last review, here are reasons 1-8: #1: steryotypes #2: goofed-up drama #3: everything is silly(taco truck for example) #4: carly thinks she's nice but she's mean #5: anyone over the drinking age is stupid #6: sam is petite but strong? #7: no real companies #8: mean teachers#9: the webshow overuses 3dfx. just look on the webshow to understand what i mean. #10: the webshow also spills personal information. #11: almost every famous thing is insulted. icarly insults the japanese race, solitare, mercades-benz, and pac-man, to name a few. #12: there are too many reoccuring jokes(sam's obsession of meat, freddy's computer, gibby pulling his shirt off, etc.) #13: the video games based off the show suck. #14: freddy has a lack of masculinity. why? it's getting unoriginal. #15: the show is targeted towards a female audience. i also hate shows directed to a male audiences too, so i prefer icarly to be for both genders. #16: the words "nub" and "no chiz". #17: the overuse of laugh tracks.part 3 coming in early spring! just in time for spring break!

i watched the halloween episode...oh my god i wanted to die. the acting was just awful. the lines were uttered with absolutely no conviction. its a bad idea for a show as well, i mean who would watch some web show like that in real life? miranda cosgrove was great in a supporting role in drake and josh but doesn't have the force of character to anchor her own show. i'm even more upset because her leaving is a major reason why drake and josh ended. she was approached with her own show...she jumped ship on drake and josh. they then decided that maybe they would do a thing with drake and josh moving to college, thereby explaining the loss of meagan as a character but drake had already had thoughts of moving on to bigger and better things and he figured if miranda did it why couldn't he. the best part of the show was the theme song... a catchy, good tune in a mire of mediocrity. of course drake bell was dubbing miranda's voice for the whole thing and wrote the tune...

out of boredom and vast curiosity, i decided to check this show out today since my four year old niece loves it. i should have known that it was a show that only a four year old could like. the show was pretty bad.first of all, the show just wasn't funny. the laugh track went off at the most inappropriate times which was very annoying, especially since none of the jokes were funny. the laugh track went off at some point when the one kid who's the cameraman said "i'm going to go polish my lense". how the hell is that funny? the parts in it (like meat drumming) that were supposed to be funny was just stupid to anyone who's over the age of eleven.now, i have a feeling that four year olds are not the target audience. however, since i have a four year old niece who watches it, this sort of thing concerned me while i was watching it: it doesn't show very good behavior. in the episode i was watching, it shows sam stealing carly's sandwich and pushing her down to the ground, just so carly can stand up and do the same thing back to her. i would not want to see my niece acting that rude. i also don't like the idea of two young girls having a web show where they give out personal information... if this was real, there would be freaks all over her.this show would probably be good and funny to someone who's eleven or younger, but anyone older than that, just stay away from it. i'll give this two stars since i guess i can see how it can be funny to a kid.

this show is just plain awful. i liked to watch drake and josh, which was great, and before that the amanda show, also funny, but this is just awful. in my opinion watching this felt like watching those --- movies from seltzberg, painful and uncleaver. this is about 3 dumb@$$ kids who make a crappy web-show (while stealing the hole ithing) while their retarded brother is making sculptures (he has no life). the cast is crap, megan from drake and josh is carly (ahhhhhh!)a ugly b!tch is sam and some kid they pulled off the street plays fred. all i saw from this (ugg) are random "jokes" that include the brother making a clay-mation film, he also played an arcade game called pac-rat (genious), sam and carly being retards on their web show, and fred being a dork. the only episode a saw (cant remember the title) where fred gets bad luck by not forewarding an email.i find videos on youtube funnier than this junk. and why the hell do they get youtube jack@$$ fred, get avgn to cancel the show with his potty mouth. just skip this show.

again, like many other tv shows, a certain actor/actresses in thrust into the limelight, in this case miranda cosgrove, having built up her reputation in previous movies/series (especially by nickelodeon and dan schneider. she is now the star of the show, gets to sing the soundtrack ( which she did not write and thus gets even more fame from that). wonderful? it creates as much imbalance in popularity vs her other co-stars, especially nathan kress, who is continually thrust into minor rolls in each episode, except idont want to fight. cosgrove's music would never have met the charts without this show and her singing the main theme song (which was not written by her) and other covers such as about you now and stay my baby. let's not forget that she lip sync/sings her song live too. is that how you create vocalist nowadays?back to the show, cosgrove reveals more physically by acting scenes in a bikini, hawaiian hula type bra and mentioned bra many times through out. bras and seen in many cases (though not of the other actresses). wedgies are mentioned, panties have been mentioned once. og let us not forget "oh my god" a come phrase (are any of the scriptwriters/actors christian?) granted that the show is not meant to be just for kids, i'm surprised at the multitude of mentions of the female undergarment, especially in the first episode, where the phrase "pointy boobs" were mentioned. i'm not sure whether kids would thus refrain from saying that at home/in school afterwards. it's not that i'm against the mentioning or showing of female undergarments (which girls will wear), but for a show from nickelodeon, the people in charge should have realised that kids would get the exposure to such stuff. i doubt that other nickelodeon shows have such content in them.as mentioned is other reviews, the laughter track is extremely annoying and unnecessary in many parts--for example, when the character sam cries, how on earth is that a time to laugh? it distracts people from getting the joke and is used almost in every sentence.as mentioned, cosgrove is made the star of the show and thus gains the utmost fame and support from die hard fans, who even scolded a hotel staff when she is told to keep her noise level down (see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk0gtfuk98u). jennette mccurdy is the second star of the show but she faces competition from cosgrove in the music industry (compare the popularity of her new single vs cosgrove's covers). as noted, the third co-star nathan kress is the least noted of the lot. he is portrayed as a atypical boy who suffers the brunt of bullying by a girl and other boys but somehow a wizard at technology. his height in early episodes make him a cute actor but unusual given his character's crush on carly/cosgrove. beyond that, kress isn't breaking into the music industry and as cosgrove's fame grows with each episode, kress falls behind. i would bet that he is the least paid of all the three actors.the content of the show is of course fictional, but also lets one wonder how it fits into a comedy series at certain times (thus the laughter track is used).it also contains several continuity errors (how can your father be and air force colonel on a submarine? us special forces have their own branches, and the air force doesn't use us submarines--that is for seals). a unique feature is that of allowing viewers to submit their own videos to be shown during or after the episodes, but again the videos somehow do not meet the theme of comedy.once again, it is a show that is riddled with mentions of the female undergarments, exposure of skin, and over used laughter tracks. it is a series which thrusts a teen actress so far into the crowd such that her songs/actions are excessive supported by her fans, leaving her co stars behind.

first off, i just want to say that this show could've done well, way better than it's doing now. what brought it down was certainly the acting. miranda cosgrove, who acts as the main character carly, looked almost worthy of her own show when she was on drake and josh. unfortunately, icarly was a big let down. not only can miranda not act convincingly enough, but she's incredibly stiff when she moves. she looks as if she's not sure how the character "carly" would move or stand. in the very first episode at the end when she throws the hat up, her arm doesn't ever leave her side from her elbow up. even when she was dancing she looked like a stick in the breeze. and the singing? the theme song was great, only because drake had been in it, the music was pretty good and miranda's voice sounded fake. i have to admit, the plot and settings are good, unrealistic, but hey, that's nick. they're practically known for stupid lines and characters. but wow, is icarly the worst of them all.

i won't say the show is all bad, because there are some funny parts, like spencer, and a few random incidents. but other than that, let's face it, it's just another dry sitcom that kids are buying into.miranda cosgrove was cute and funny as megan on drake and josh. honestly, she is mediocre in icarly and is just not as funny as she tries to be. the actress who plays sam seems to be half-asleep most of the time, and her antics are so clichéd that i would think of them. they're not funny, just annoying. and freddie is okay, but not that interesting.of course, the situations are unrealistic, but it's not all bad. some are bothersome, though. here are a few: 1. the girls are 14, and have a web show that gives away too much personal information, with a weekly audience of 27,000(wtf), with little to no advertising, and they can still go on about their lives not being attacked by crazy people 2.their web show gets too much praise ($100,000 yearly to advertise sneakers, a free trip to japan, plain white ts performance, and so on). honestly, anyone over the age of 6 would not find their "comedy" entertaining.3. how is it that they are so "average", yet they own a three story loft, spencer does hardly anything and can still afford many basic luxuries, and they have all the equipment for a web show? 4. all of the adults are idiots. all of them.5. no 5 foot high girl, no matter how obnoxious and tenacious, can take down trained cops, unless she's muscular. sam is skinny and petite.6. no one can fall down 9 stories in an elevator and live.7. kids can handle finding out about criminals better than cops.the show is stupid. really, it seems harmless, but making kids think that they can be obnoxious to their elders, live alone in seattle when they're only 14 with an irresponsible moron, and give out personal information is just wrong.i'm disappointed to say that my cousin, who is 3, enjoys the show. what happened to the cartoons when i was her age?

i rented this thinking it would be pretty good just by the cover of the movie case. judge and jury started out pretty good killer chasing the man who killed his wife on a bike with a cool gun, but this movie got progressively stupider as it went on. david keith is awesome actor especially when he plays a role like this too bad the movie was a piece of crap it really wasted his talent. judge and jury was well plain dumb i gave it a 3 should have gave it a 2, i gave it an extra star just because david keith's gun was cool.

so much for judge and jury, which lives up to its nonsense title. what good is there? the lighting is terribly foggy! another horror movie you ask? well, that's perfectly explainable. david keith actually does pretty good at disguising clowns, chefs, and other shenanigans while being the killer who escaped death row. but overall, despite some new twists, it's reasonably stupid. unapix has been putting out some ludicrous productions recently, and this one only means so much. we, the jury, find this film guilty for its indecent exposure to many of us sitting around believing it's a total waste of our time!

honestly, buying this movie was a waste of money. it's one of the most boring movies i have seen in my life. the only part i liked is the ending, but it's so slow that not even the fantastic ending can save this movie.

it's nice to see julie andrews trying a straight dramatic role here--something she hadn't done in awhile--but her character of judith(wise they didn't try to pass her off as a 'judy')has the old refined manners and tomboyish hairstyle of yore, and andrews enacts 'grown-up' as any other actress would interpret frigid. it's a surprisingly bland drama set in barbados involving omar sharif(not the liveliest leading man around--not even in 1974!)hoping to make andrews a spy while also slowly leading her into the proverbial bedroom. unmemorable outing does have some camp value: the james bond-like credits at the beginning are a cheesy hoot. as for julie: she's quiet and contemplative, but that doesn't do much for the audience, or for the film. blake edwards paces the freakin' thing like a funeral. * from ****

you know that this film is in serious trouble when the best acting job is the support role played by arnold schwarzenegger. while this was still relatively early in his career and he wasn't the best actor, compared to brigitte nielsen, he's sir john gielgud. in fact, this film proves that the only reason she got much of any attention were her boobs and because she was involved with the incredibly self-destructive football player, mark gastineau. so, instead of this being her "break out film", this and a beverly hills cop movie mark about as high as she went in her one-note career. it was obvious, too, that the financing wizards gave up on this movie as well, because the supporting cast (aside from arnold) is pretty lame and the script is dull, dull, dull. fans looking for another conan movie would no doubt be very disappointed in this slow and uninvolving film.

corny and some really bad acting but for a golan-globus film about right on par. saw this movie back in 1985 mostly because i liked sword and sorcery films(what was i thinking?). arnold is in it playing a high lord trying to make sure an ancient talisman is destroyed before it blows up the world.brigitte nielsen is the title character who at the time was sly's girl and a pretty bad actress.movie producers like to cast playboy type women who cant act in low budget b movies. brigitte cheeses it up as sonya and arnold acts wooden as lord kalidor.there is also sandahl bergman(who was in the original conan movie as valeria)here she plays the evil queen gedren,an obvious camp to her conan role. and then one of the most irritating child actors onscreen(ernie reyes)as prince tarn who should have been slapped hard and sent to bed.what a little irritating scut. some of the swordfights arent too bad but the music really sucks. special effects are cheap and look very 70's ,like the explosion of the evil queen's castle at the climax of the movie. overall a very low par film but b movie film buffs might like it for its campiness.

after a long hard night being partied away at the walkabout in islington, i needed a pick-me-up. my throat hurt, my wallet was empty and i ended up chatting to a drug addict at a bus-stop trying to sell me some petrol. today, i watched "red sonja" and i can honestly say that i felt much better last night than i do right now. brigitte nielsen leads a bunch of ass-kicking warriors in various shapes and sizes to recover a green rock from some evil queen whose motives are never fully explained. yep, it's that good."red sonja" isn't in a genre known for great films until peter jackson came along with a certain oscar-winning trilogy. in fact, the best swords-and-sorcery film i could think of before "lord of the rings" was george lucas's kiddie-friendly "willow". perhaps, in view of this, one should go a little easy on this film. but i can't - it's poorly written, badly acted (with the exception of paul smith, who's just average) and dreadfully put together. the film is as convincing as an episode of the flintstones, with costumes and scenery seemingly lifted straight outta bedrock. considering the comic-book source material, it is easy to forgive the various plot inconsistencies. why sonja insists on saving the most annoying kid, in this world or that one, is bewildering. his personality seems to flick from spoilt brat to polite gentleman at the flick of a switch. schwarzenegger displays less charisma than a field full of cows and just goes through the motions, a perfect actor for his breakthrough role in "the terminator".it's simple to kick a film when you're down but the fact remains that this is not a good film, by any stretch of the imagination. when nielsen mourns the death of her sister and schwarzenegger tenderly places his hand on her shoulder to comfort her and then blurts out, in that distinctive germanic accent, "she's dead" then you know you're in for a rough ride. a few smiles were raised at inappropriate points, such as the priestesses of a temple who, when sent plunging to their deaths in a hole in the ground, seemed to enjoy the experience - at least, judging from the orgasmic moans that seemed to echo around the place. if you have to watch an eighties fantasy film that wasn't porn, watch "willow" (but never take that as a ringing endorsement). for the real thing, take yourself to your local multiplex and show peter jackson what a great job he did with "lord of the rings". trust me, 11 oscars really does mean it's a great film - unlike bloody "titanic".

possible spoilers as peter jackson has so brilliantly shown in his `lord of the rings' trilogy, it is quite possible to make good films, even great ones, within the heroic fantasy genre. the genre has distinguished literary antecedents, dating back to the mediaeval chivalric romances, particularly the arthurian legends, upon which tolkien and other authors have drawn. `lord of the rings' apart, however, it is difficult to think of any other sword-and-sorcery films which are any good. i would agree with the reviewer who said that the best of a bad bunch was ron howard's `willow', and even that achieved little distinction other than that of being a merely mediocre film as opposed to a positively bad one. `red sonja', however, cannot achieve the even more modest distinction of being simply a bad film as opposed to an appalling one.as with `willow', many of the plot-elements in `red sonja' are derived from `the lord of the rings'. an evil ruler seeks to gain control of an artefact with supernatural powers in order to achieve an ambition of world domination, but is thwarted by an assorted group of heroes. the film, set in the hyborian age, a barbaric era in the earth's remote past, starts with the villain of the piece, the wicked queen gedren, making unwelcome sexual advances to the heroine sonja. when these are rebuffed, gedren (not a woman to take no for an answer) reacts by murdering sonja's parents and brother. (in 1985 it was presumably still considered politically correct not only to make the chief villain a woman but also to make one of the main motives for her villainy frustrated lesbian lust).gedren's next move is to capture the talisman, a sort of fluorescent green soccer ball with magical powers, by slaughtering the whole of the scantily-dressed female priesthood charged with protecting it, just as they are about to destroy it because they feel its powers have become too dangerous. among the dead is sonja's sister, her sole surviving relative. sonja herself, however, has not been idle, but has enrolled in a martial arts academy from which she graduates summa cum laude, and sets out to avenge herself. along the way she teams up with kalidor, a heroic wandering swordsman-king resembling tolkien's aragorn, prince tarn, the spoilt child-ruler of a kingdom that has fallen to gedren's powers, and falkon, tarn's loyal servant. the rest of the film is fairly predictable, as sonja and her allies try to overthrow gedren and prevent the destruction of the world threatened by the out-of-control talisman.just what is it that makes this film so bad? well, the acting, for a start. arnold schwarzenegger as kalidor gives the sort of typical wooden, poker-faced performance that became his trademark, at least in the early part of his career, complete with heavy foreign accent. compared with brigitte nielsen as the heroine, however, he looks like laurence olivier. miss nielsen seems to have had even worse language difficulties, delivering every line in the mechanical, toneless voice of someone who has just completed lesson three of a `teach-yourself-english-by-correspondence' course. one wonders if she was hired for the role just to make arnie look good by comparison. the other characters, while not conducting their own private struggles against the english language, are simply cartoonish caricatures, especially prince tarn who must be one of the most obnoxious screen youngsters ever.an even worse fault than the bad acting, however, is the film's almost complete lack of imagination. this is a particularly glaring fault in a fantasy film, as films of this genre need to rely on their imaginative power in order to persuade the audience to suspend the natural feelings of disbelief that would be provoked by a fantastic plot. when we watch peter jackson's masterpiece we can persuade ourselves, at least for the next three hours, that we are in middle-earth, that elves, wizards and hobbits do exist, and that the fate of the world really does depend upon the destruction of a magic ring. when we watch `red sonja' we are persuaded of nothing except that we are watching a bunch of actors with bad accents fighting one another on a hillside for possession of a lime-green football.this lack of imagination even starts with the film's title. the british science-fiction author brian aldiss, when challenged about the exotic names given to his characters, replied that there was little point in creating a fictional alien society with its own distinctive culture if you were going to spoil the effect by calling the hero joe. (admittedly, tolkien was ableto get away with giving the name sam to one of his main characters, but that was because hobbits were supposed to be reassuringly familiar, the middle-earth equivalent of tweedy, pipe-smoking englishmen). similarly, giving the heroine of a tale ostensibly set in a long-gone barbaric age a common girls' name like `sonia' (which is how the name `sonja' is pronounced) is about as appropriate as calling her `betty' or `mary-jane'.the film seems to have been made on a very small budget, which makes me wonder why they bothered at all. fantasy needs to be done convincingly, or not at all. it was obviously shot in a remote mountain area, with little or no attempt to suggest a distinctive culture. the few buildings we see, such as the temple of the talisman or gedren's palace, are obviously cheap sets. we learn that tarn's capital city has been destroyed by gedren using the power of the talisman, but we do not actually see this event; all we see is what might be a thunderstorm taking place on the other side of a hill. at first you wonder how sonja intends to overthrow an entire kingdom with only a few allies, but when you see how small an army gedren has at her disposal it becomes more understandable. when an earthquake threatens to destroy the palace, you wonder if this is the talisman at work or merely a crew member inadvertently leaning against the set. if we can enjoy this film for nothing else, we can at least enjoy it for its inadvertent humour; a fine example of the so-bad-it's-funny school of filmmaking. ed wood would have been proud of this one. if it had been shown on californian television the night before the recall election, gray davis would still be governor. 2/10.

i remember the trailer for this infamously weak spin-off of conan. i saw the movie years later and laughed my head off. unintentionally! poor briggite nielson. her career never had a chance thanks to cobra and red sonja. the plot of the movie is this: sonja(brigitte nielson) hails from a tribe of female warriors who were killed off by an evil queen gedren(sandahl bergman). queen gedren steals the orb the female warriors were protecting and uses it to destroy each town she passes by. sonja goes on a hunt for queen gedren and later finds out that gedren killed her parents. on her quest she reluctantly joins kalidor(arnold schwarzenegger), an arrogant prince named tarn(ernie reyes jr.) and his bumbling idiotic servant, falkon(paul l. smith). together they go on a hunt for queen gedren and the orb. the acting is sub par and the action scenes are soso. i mean briggite neilson looks so emotionally distant. for someone who lost her whole family as well as her female comrades, sonja doesn't look fazed at all. arnold is playing his usual stoic role and ernie reyes jr.... what an annoying snot-nosed brat he was in this movie! the moronic manservant falkon had more personality than these guys. the action scenes are the only redeeming moments of the movie even though sometimes they fall flat. the scene where they fight the mechanical sea creature made me laugh till my ribs ached. the dialog is a hoot also. its as if the screenwriter thought that nobody was going to take the movie seriously so he gave everybody stupid lines to work with. i can only recommend this movie to you if you like your epic movies extra campy. anyone else don't bother.

honestly, this movie is weak. very weak. only capital character can something. she's work like supercharger on bad engine...so, if you like red-haired valkyries - see that. but better find picture of brigitte as sonja and put it on desktop. it will save of disappointments. well, arnold also do his deal...but it definitely not best his role. other characters - bad is not that word. sword fights? monsters? ridiculous. plot is really shame. why was necessary rape she? especially, we don't see it.anyway movie is weak. though worse movies exist...without main characters it would be just ******. and if somebody even discusses it, maybe...

okay, i admit i like brigitte neilsen in an unhealthy way, i just have a thing for 6' tall women with swords. there i said it.what's wrong with the movie? just about every mistake you can make was made. you take a successful movie series (conan) and you drag it through the mud with a bad script, bad casting, bad effects, and the worst thing of all...you put a cute kid in there for comic relief. this kind of thing almost killed the indiana jones series ya know. cute kids are for disney movies, not real movies. neilsen at least took the movie seriously, even though it seems nobody else did. the plot had schwarzenegger repeatedly pulling red sonja's fat out of the fire and that undercut her character considerably. a warrior woman doesn't need a dude to get her out of a mess, thats her job! to not re-use the conan character in this movie was a crime. kalidor? sheesh. the movie never set the proper mood and its pacing was rather disjointed and sloppy, unlike conan the barbarian which had multiple story lines that flowed gracefully. when it comes to fantasy movies, its okay to have cheesy costumes, its okay to have harryhausen style animation, its okay to have silly exorbitant sets that make no sense, but to have a horrible script is unforgivable.this movie could have been a classic, but the script felt like it was written by a 12 year old.

recap: since the warrior queen gedren raised and slaughtered most of sonja's family, she has trained in the art of sword fighting. now, gedren has taken a very powerful talisman, that threatens to destroy the world if not destroyed, killing sonja's sister in the process. now sonja is out for revenge, and to save the world. along the way, she meets the very conan-like (but not conan, no!) kalidor, the child-prince tarn and his bodyguard falcon. at first sonja declines all help, but is later forced to accept it, and together they go to save the world.comments: when you watch a movie like this, and you think that it is the story that the is the best element in this movie, the movie is in big trouble. because 1) a movie like this should draw its strength upon good swordfights and effects, and 2) the story is really, really bad. it is simple, and uncomplicated and really offers nothing in way of character development or even suspense. it is predictable and boring, and the obvious couple, sonja and kalidor, has no chemistry at all. and the kid is just annoying. and most of the scenes is drawn out so long that they become boring. though the movie is not very long, it has not material enough to fill its time. and so back to point 1). the fighting is slow, uneventful and really bad. it clearly shows most fighters clearly blocking the opponents strokes far ahead of the opponent has even begun to strike. in my honest opinion, i believe most kids, fighting with sticks, creates more exciting fights playing knights than this movie did. all in all, this is a really bad spin-off, that should be avoided by all who liked the conan-movies.2/10

... when dubbed into another language. let's face it: neither nielsen nor schwarzenegger are really good actors when it comes to dialog. and given the campy lines they are supposed to utter this is a loose-loose situation. any type of voice-over is sure to be an improvement (and it actually is - at least in the german version).but that is only a minor point. the acting is bad. the speeded up combat sequences are pathetic. nielsen couldn't use her sword to fight her way out of a wet paper bag. this becomes painfully obvious when compared to the fluidity of motion exhibited by the kid (who has had some martial arts training, no doubt) and to the athleticism shown off by sandahl bergman.schwarzenegger does his conan thing - nothing new here.some of the visuals are nice, i'll have to grant that. the dragon skeleton bridge looks cool. but more often than not the plaster is all too evident.overall the movie isn't worth seeing. even 'conan the destroyer' is better than this (although only marginally). i would have much rather seen bergman as red sonja as she was originally supposed to be, but i doubt that that could have saved this movie - oh well.3/10

this film was released soon after the conan films, a sort of female conan, red sonja played by sylvester stallones ex-wife brigitte nielsen. she's not a very good actress unfortunately as proved in rocky iv and cobra. the whole film feels cheap, but strangely arnold swarzenegger appears in this film but not as conan, although he looks, acts and fights like conan from the two conan films, i don't know what thats about. anyway he only appears about every twenty minutes and doesn't hang around for long. maybe arnold filmed this in his time off from filming conan the destroyer or something? anyway the film is way to slow and boring for an action film, skip this and watch conan the barbarian instead.

this, in my opinion, is a very poor movie that advertises arnold schwarzenegger as starring (despite him being the co-star) only to sell more copies. obviously taking influence from the similarly themed conan' movies, this film fails to prove as enjoyable and eventually fails to entertain at all.bridgette neilsen stars as sonja, a beautiful woman who has been given unbelievable strength by a ghostly figure after her village was pillaged, her family killed and she herself raped by the soldiers of queen gedran (sandahl bergman). gedran is a tyrant queen who wants control over the barbaric world and seeks out a talisman protected by sonja's sister to do it. after discovering what has happened sonja sets out for revenge and at the same time she must save the world from the wrath of gedran. kalidor (schwarzenegger), the master of the talisman, sets out to protect her whether she wants him there or not.the first major problem with this movie is the beginning. the events leading up to the point where sonja receives her powers could have easily made a good ten to fifteen minutes of enjoyable film. however, the beginnings are rushed into what seems like a quick one-minute `previously on.' segment from a television show. had they actually made these events part of the story and cut out some of the filler later on they may have been able to start redeeming this movie but unfortunately they didn't (i wonder why director richard fleischer has only currently directed two movies since red sonja).this film also features some of the most annoying characters in history like tarn (ernie reyes jr.) who is a stupid character and just adds an over abundance of camp to the movie, which sometimes works but in this case fails miserably. he was quite obviously written into the movie for some comic relief but with the overall absurdity of the film anyway this was another costly mistake for red sonja'.for all it's faults there were some good fight scenes involving both neilsen and arnie which are worth noting but these are nowhere enough to save this turkey. the acting is about as good as it gets for movies of this quality and even arnie didn't seem too bothered about his performance. i don't recommend this film at all; to me it's a waste of an hour and a half. my rating for red sonja'  3/10

i figure the company that made this movie wanted people to think of the conan movies, but unfortunately for the ones who made this one it does just that. you will be thinking, man the conan movies were pretty cool...this one is totally boring and sucks. the story, who cares? it isn't going to help you like this movie more or less as it just seems like a really cheap film. arnold, doesn't look like he belongs in this one, why he agreed to play the role is beyond me. well probably for the money. i just love the monster in the water that turns out to be a machine. lame! this movie is just plain and simply terrible.

i watched this movie, or part of it, in hope that it would be fun to laugh at how bad it was, but it soon became clear that this was just plain silly. for one you have the worst acting ever! the lead "actress" birgitte nielsen is terrible, uninspired and hardly even attractive. and she certainly do not look like the female warrior who could easily kick some veteran warrior kings butt, but she does. and whats with the feminist attitude, it's plain hypocrisy. for one her family was killed by a women, then she joins some warrior school or something so she can learn how to fight men. she then joins up with a fat servant and his child king, whose city was destroyed by gedren. those two characters are just plain stupid and destroys the little of atmosphere that the movie managed to create. after this i could not take any more of nielsen painful acting, and the stupid clichés and lack of some real action.schwarzenegger as kalidor was the only part of this movie which actually made it remotely watchable. i liked the conan movie, but this is pure crap!

i mistakenly thought that this neo-noir effort from the buffalo - niagara falls area might be something different. unfortunately i was incorrect. there are are many problems with "the falls", that really have nothing to do with it's low budget video production. immediately one has to question why all the constant narration? my feeling is that if you have a decent script, the audience will follow along, without having to be insulted with voice over storytelling. the acting is very amateurish, which is not unexpected, but simply adds to the problems. finally, the entire thing is annoyingly shot like an mtv music video, which i found to be totally unacceptable. the narration, bad acting, and annoying video effects are all good reasons why this should be avoided. - merk

this film is basically a poor take on the old urban legend of the babysitter who gets crank calls telling her to check the children, she calls the police who trace the calls and find there coming from inside the house. when a killer calls has a story so simplistic a little kid could have written it. not much suspense, it becomes clear who the killer is halfway through the film. at the beginning, when the first victim is killed it looks like a bondage fetish scene from a porn site or something. whats up with that? the film is oh so typical slasher fare with a plot about as original as a beatles concert. even by low budget slasher standards its cheesy. don't waste your time with this. nuff said

predictable, gory, over-gimmicky, mediocre. don't waste your time - there are many much better movies out there. resurrection starts out ok but the plot quickly becomes repetitive. my interest level fell off steadily. by the end of the movie i was just glad it was finally over. the characters never fully developed. the cinematography is muddy and the quick change pov rotations - while impressive in 1999 perhaps, presently merely serve to label the movie as attempting to substitute gee whiz flash for plot and character substance. the film shooting gimmicks serve some purpose (convey tension and anxiety) but are constantly overused and ultimately become counterproductive. a shame overall - the film/story obviously had potential and the producers/directors and actors obviously have technical skill. a disappointment.

if i didn't know any better, i would have thought resurrection was made in the late 80's/early 90's, when crap sold as film in hollywood.i don't understand why people like christopher lambert. he speaks like he's reading off of cue cards and turns into a fountain whenever he has to emote. he was easily the movie's weakest aspect. the other actors were ok, nothing horrible.it's easy to see where the majority of the budget went: the special effects. the killings look pretty professional, but hardly make up for the film's dullness.i wouldn't go as far as to say resurrection is a carbon copy of se7en, but it certainly bears a certain resemblance to it. centering on a religious-minded murderer on a modern crusade, the detectives investigating his work have to rely on bible passages and christian history to piece together the killer's puzzle. resurrection, however, is bereft of se7en's clever storytelling, cinematography, acting...well, everything that makes it good. instead, resurrection lies to the audience and uses the scooby doo method of mystery to surprise it.in conclusion, resurrection was about as bad as i expected it to be. i almost feel bad for criticizing this movie since i knew it would be bad going in, but...sue me.

when a killer calls has got to be the biggest ripoff released by asylum so far. it's about a sexy babysitter on duty who receives spooky calls from a creepy voice who asks her repeatedly, "have you checked the girl?" naturally she has the calls traced by the cops (after having to perform some realistically unnecessary tasks -- hanging up when "he" calls, waiting ten seconds, and dialing *57). sound familiar? yeah, that's why i rented it, too.well, it should. and i hate to say it, but this could've been more entertaining than the big-screen crapfest that was released around the same time if not for one fatal mistake -- rather than revelling in b-movie ripoff glory, it tried to do something original. it tried to make the lead character sympathetic, rather than having clichéd, campy fun with her. mind you, this could've worked with a talented actress. but she wasn't. sure, she looked good, and she screamed, and cried, but . . . oh well, whatever.then came the horrific ending. not horrific in that it was horrifying, horrific in that it was boring. the pacing up until that point (about an hour in) was campy, clichéd, and fun. then it heads in another direction, and it veers away from just another dumb, fun slasher movie with a sexy "teenage" cast to a hostel-esquire gore/borefest.i guess this falls into the "oh well, whatever" category. the lead actress flubbed a line? oh well, whatever, i don't feel like reshooting it. we forgot to give the killer motivation? oh well, whatever, i don't feel like rewriting it. the pacing completely changes halfway through? oh well, whatever, i don't feel like shaving fifteen minutes off. continuity errors? oh well, whatever.if you like this kind of movie (dumb, cheesy, predictable, campy splatter movie with sexy cast), then you'll be fine up until the ending. the ending is stupid, it's not fun, it's not scary, it's not campy or cheesy or quickly-paced. in fact, there was almost exactly five minutes of the character doing nothing but being tied up (and that's not a spoiler because it's on the back of the dvd) and looking around at the stuff in the room, then screaming, and . . . whatever.

did anyone notice?when miss brook went skinny dipping,she left the water wearing white bikini bottoms and yet had previously taken it all off to join cabin boy.this could have been a good film without miss brooks phony accent and a year on the island please.how come that kelly looked always clean and ready for a fm photo shoot.what started out with premise turned in to soft porn.and billy zane come on,you cant be that hard up for film offers.check out dead calm.also when the people took her away ,how come she scoffed her face and after all that time didn't feel like throwing up.i suggest billy find decent scripts,kelly stick to photo shoots and cabin boy play the son of zorro in a future sequel.

yes, bad acting isn't only one thing to mention. bad script,not so bad music. unfortunately.nice girl and nice boy with perfect bodies and super teeth just isn't enough for me and for you too.first thing in the morning after crash they go to swim to the sea, to have some fun !!! smiling ...they find everything in the sea. i mean things like fishing-net, knife, scuba dive things, ropes, bottles, husband ...woodoo stuff , are you kidding. stupid. they are so happy on the island, they are going to die, and they are happy. love, peace. love. just stupid.terrible, skip this one please.

i can only assume the previous posts came from execs at the production company...attended the uk premiere last night. zane and brook attended (they probably knew i was gonna be there) and are undoubtedly stars, but what a turkey of a film. i felt sorry for them at times, when the audience erupted in laughter at what were serious 'thriller' scenes.but perhaps i was missing the point. perhaps an element of tongue-in-cheek was intended. if so, pure genius. if not, career genocide.on the plus side, zane always shines, and brook can actually act a little. as the other half said (as we ran out the cinema, avec broken ribs), they can be forgiven for this film as they both seem like nice people! the scriptwriter, however, should be marooned.

a holiday on a boat, a married couple, an angry waiter and a shipwreck is the reason to this films beginning.i like boobs. no question about that. but when the main character allies with whoever happens to have the most fish at the moment, mostly by having sex with them and playing the role of the constant victim, my anger just rises to a whole new level. take two guys (a husband and another man), put a pure bombshell woman in the middle of them, ad a deserted island, subtract all her moral issues, ad a whole bunch of moral issues to the men and mix it in a big bowl of arguments, fish and a zippo lighter and you will come up with a piece of junk movie like this. the acting is, i would say, good. there are some bloopers but not many as far as i could see. the main female character makes me sick. this is due to her lack of moral values. the man with the most fish get's her attention. even though one of them is her husband, she sees no problem with being unfaithful with (manuel) the other man because "i must do it to survive". how can you justify having sex with another man for fish when your husband is 30feet away? and he won't even benefit from it? the female character has absolutely no problems to justify anything that she does. if she doesen't get approval for her actions, she's a victim.i recommend everyone to see this movie. this is the kind of movie that will make just about everything else you see this year a pleasant movie experience.

how pointless, hideous characters and boring film. saved by brief sex scenes, mad witch, gorgeous desert island and brooks body. the plot is tenuous, the characters are shallow and unlikeable. having said that i did manage to watch it all, mainly because i was totally transfixed by the jiggling and kind of hoping that her character would come good in the end. the film was well shot, well directed but perhaps the casting let it down in some ways. disappointing. really summed the review up in the first line but this website dictates that you need to write 10 lines minimum. it would be better to spend the time watching another film.

the three stooges are arguably the greatest comedy team in film history. for that reason alone, they deserved a much better ending at columbia than they received with this short."sappy bullfighters" is just not good. granted, this is not all joe besser's fault. i personally feel that some of his shorts are fun enough, simply because of the departure from the stooges usual fanfare that they contain, and for the fact that larry is sometimes showcased more. however, this short just will not do. and the fact that one knows that it is their last short that was ever shown, well that just adds to the overall disgust.this film just epitomizes how short subjects were on their last dying breaths during this time and how little effort went into making them. this short is so sloppy. it is a simple re-make of a curly short, "what's the matador?", filmed years before. as if this fact wasn't bad enough, the studio actually threw in footage of moe and larry from the original (which was filmed nearly 20 years prior). are these things not obvious? laughable or sad? you be the judge.another part of this short that makes it miserable is the fact that it is basically a joe besser showcase, with him showing that all he is (at least in this film) is a curly-wanna-be-gone-completely-wrong! moe and larry have little to do in this short. as a larry fan, i also must say that i feel it a bit disgraceful to have besser get to use the joke that larry originally popularized in the short "ants in the pantry". to see besser say "i can't see, i can't see!" and have larry say the simple "why can't you see?", while besser gets to quip "i got my eyes closed", is just wrong on all levels.the two brave soldiers who stuck it out for all those years, howard and fine, have so little to do in this short. there are hardly any funny bits with them. the only thing that qualifies is larry hiding under the bed of a jealous husband, attempting to be "pepe", his dog.one can't blame the dynamic duo. larry and moe give it their all. no matter how ridiculous things could get (and i'm sure they had their opinions by this point in their careers) howard and fine never gave anything less than their best. their efforts do not pale from 1934-1959.i often enjoy many shorts that some will dismiss as horrible. i'm all for their more "experimental", unusual shorts. at least those contain new ideas. however, this short, i think everyone can agree, is just not good.thank goodness tv later discovered the boys after the shorts department closed. had they been forced to go out in this fashion, well that would have been a gross injustice to all the years they invested in making audiences laugh.

the movie opens with a scene that simply could not be. a man wakes up and while his wife remains in bed, he begin his morning prayers in his bedroom while his wife sleeps peacefully. morning blessings are recited, but only the ones gitai finds controversial. the rest are conveniently omitted. then while in philactories and a tallis he kisses his wife good morning!! this is not an accurate depiction of jewish prayer in any home, let alone a chassidic home. amos gittai is not interested in accurately portraying chassidic life. he is interested in adding to his ever growing list of melodramatic and empty films. the mikka (ritual bath) scenes are far from accurate and his jewish wedding was laughable as it does not even approach the atmosphere of a chassidic wedding. i have many problems with the chassidic way of life, but i have no use for amos gittai's commentary on these issues. he would have you think that the chassidim are all dense comformists with severe bouts of depression. i may not agree with the chassidic lifestyle, but i acknowledge that chassidic life has many layers. amos gitai is blinded by his own secularist pseudo-intellectual stubborness and is therefore, incapable of portraying an accurate depiciton of chassidic life. aside from his poor research and unbalanced portrayal of chassidic life, gitai fails in other aspects as well. the plot is full of holes, the dialogue loaded with silence, the soundtrack is too repetitive and the acting while at times powerfull was too often loaded with melodrama. the movie drags on and on and the ending is not worth sticking around for. watch if you must, but be warned. if you want to learn about chassidic life go to the communities and talk to chassidim. do not rely on gittai's film!

i don't know what chasidik movement was this film about?i saw this film a year ago.i am an orthodox woman, living in an orthodox chasidic? community and i can tell you i was offended by this movie!it's so far away from the reality, it's scary ! the director could at least hire a chasidik rabbi for a brief consultation, before making a "realistic" movie about ultra -orthodoxs! for example meir's davening (morning prayers)! or a jewish wedding, or a mikveh ( ritual bath ) customs.movie is loaded with technical inaccuracies..but it's not them that bothered me. it's the spiritual side. orthodoxs are portrayed next to taliban. woman are powerless, while men are the ultimate rulers ! please!no one can force a jewish girl to the chuppa against her will ! we ,orthodoxs,also, live by the law (halacha ) which clearly states man's responsibilities towards his wife.no beating and no raping,also!and no man ( even rabbi)is allowed to peak at the woman in the mikveh.and balanit is not to place a hand over woman's head,while she's taking a ritual bath, the idea is to immerse the whole body at one time! director was clearly trying to bash ultra orthodoxs ! but could he do so at least in a nice and more educated manner?love story? cute ! but not credible.dialogs are long and boring.the ending sucked totally.for all that drama i was at least hoping for a nice ending ,for all that sitting i felt i deserved it! obviously someone was trying to make a nice consciousness soothing movie for less observant jews, or for non- jews, perhaps..(look at those fundamentalist, they are so evil and mean...)and they succeed! long thing short: was hoping for a nice europien (kane level ) movie, got instead a tradition bashing, unrealistic,mistakenly guiding junk. i mean , today,we live in a time of a free will as never before. everyone has a right to choose. malka chose a rock singer.rivka made her choice.meir made his. many people from non observing backgrounds are choosing orthodox judaism these days.because,in this mad world religion might be a nice gateway !

my mother told me not to go to see "kadosh" -- but who ever listens to one's mother? i was so turned off by it while i was watching i thought i must have lost my feminist credentials on the way into the theater, so i checked with card-carrying feminists the next day. no, they also thought it was much more an anti-orthodox screed than a pro-feminist statement, painting the orthodox as equal to the taliban.while this israeli movie is careful to show that the sect the story is about is the ultimate ultra-orthodox messianists, it is so nasty as to be unbelievable (plus that the non-fanatic orthodox rock-'n'-roller(!) one of the sisters is in love with is incredibly sexy--even in israel that must be fantasy).the theater was quite crowded, so there's a pent-up curiosity to see israeli movies; too bad this vicious movie is the one getting wide distribution. this was almost enough to drive me back to insipid hollywood romantic movies.

unfortunately house of d is just awful, with a ridiculous plot, terrible writing, some mediocre acting, and in fact just about everything else about it is sub-par.tom flees nyc to somehow survive as a lone child in paris, and manages to convince the beautiful parisian girl he eventually marries that he's french, despite a poor grasp of her language. she's shocked when years later he reveals his "secret" to her! riiiight!he then "gifts" his tale of woe to his own son, and who we are expected to believe thinks that's just the greatest birthday gift a dad can give his 13 year old boy. if only such things were so easy! david duchovny miscasts his own wife tea leoni in the role of his mother and strikes out yet again. leoni makes me laugh as a comic but she's just plain wrong for this role.one of the problems with that is none of the characters are sympathetic. i just didn't give a damn what happened to any of them. i did rather hope that robin williams and his trademark "child in a grown-up's body" schtick would fall into a village pothole, but alas, it was not to be and we had to endure his simpering performance all the way.anton yelchin and william's daughter zelda were not bad, but i suspect the rave reviews others are giving them is simply because they weren't anywhere near as bad as everyone else in this movie. they weren't great, let me put it that way.there are so many silly and contrived aspects to this film - erykah badu, the bicycle, the catholic school and it's staff of morons, the conveniently stupid characters, etc - that this review would go on for ever, so i'll just finish up by saying that house of d is a very poor movie, and i'm almost embarrassed for duchovny.the thing that really annoys me is how i was so strongly encouraged by online "friends" to see this that i traveled a long way to do so.i would not have been so annoyed that this movie is so bad if i'd just wasted a couple of hours down at the local movie theater, but instead i lost a whole day, and discovered that my so-called "friends" are either stupid or dishonest, because this is an awful movie!

atmosphere and droll dialog don't redeem this overrated classic. boyer is a french thief hiding in the casbah of algiers while the police try to figure out how to get him out. meanwhile, he falls for lamarr and tries to find a way to escape. the film is slow to get started and never really goes anywhere. reminiscent of casablanca in some ways, it's completely lacking any larger theme than the wanted man seducing a good woman. it's all talk-talk-talk, with endless scenes of boyer swaggering among his idiot cohorts and boyer wooing lamarr in the shadows. personally, i didn't care for boyer's character for a minute, so the tension was utterly nonexistent.stock 1930s character actors stumble thru the mushy plot as boyer's henchmen--guys who clearly do not belong in algiers. sigrid gurie is the wildly-overacting jealous girlfriend of boyer. his brazen womanizing in front of her doesn't bode well for any future he might have with lamarr.especially bad is a long sequence in which an underling comes to tell boyer how another henchman was captured. it sounds exciting... too bad we didn't see it for ourselves. the ending is completely anticlimactic and seems to be remarkable only because it is not a hollywood happy ending; that doesn't stop it from being sappy.

algiers is not a classic, it is a perversion of the wonderful original pepe le moko, directed by duvivier and starring a much more attractive and charming pepe, jean gabin. if you want to fully experience the casbah and the characters in algiers, i recommend you don't even watch this movie and see pepe le moko instead, for it is much more elaborate, more beautifully filmed, the lines are not clichéd and the characters adhere much more to reality. furthermore, the ending is so dramatic and key to pepe's character that you'll find the algiers version intolerable. although algiers does an almost excellent job mimicking each scene, the acting falls short as does the credibility of the characters. plus, the wardrobe is truly breath-taking in all scenes, particularly pepe's in the last scene and gaby's (at all times) but also when she's on the boat. frankly, algiers is cheap as far as imitations go.

pepe le moko, played by charles boyer, is some sort of international criminal mastermind wanted in countries throughout europe, and to stay free he holes himself up in the casbah, a mysterious part of algiers where even the police are reluctant to go, until a senior officer is sent from paris to capture le moko once and for all. for le moko, although the casbah allows him to remain out of police custody, it also becomes a sort of prison at the same time - a place he can't leave, because the moment he does, he knows he'll be arrested.boyer's performance was good, and i can understand why he was nominated for an oscar. he captures the essence of such a character - a perfect combination of very dangerous and yet very classy at the same time. the movie itself, unfortunately, was quite a letdown. a number of parts of the story seemed inconsistent, of which i'll mention two. first was the idea that the police wouldn't enter the casbah. that was stated pretty clearly at the beginning of the film by the local commander, and yet repeated references in the movie suggest that in fact the police did enter the casbah fairly regularly. so, neither the suggestion by commissioner janvier that the police wouldn't enter, nor the statement by inspector slimane (also a decent performance by joseph calleia) that they could get into the casbah but not out seemed to make much sense. i also found it difficult to believe that le moko - hardened criminal mastermind that he was - could be so quickly swept off his feet by gaby (hedy lamarr) to the point where he entertains the local populace by singing love songs and then leaves the casbah to find her, essentially giving himself up. i understand the irony of the final few scenes, of course, as pepe leaves the freedom of his prison (the casbah) only to find real freedom in his capture (because he's shot and killed by the police.) i just found it impossible to believe that someone like le moko would fall into such a trap.this is worth watching for boyer, and to a lesser extent calleia, but the story is disappointing and inconsistent. 3/10

it is a movie which sheds the light on the begging of the palestinian struggle against the israeli occupation of palestine but it does not show the real feelings of the people back then and how they were tricked into believing that they could return to their home soon , it does not mention the massacres committed by the jews like der yassine and how they tortured and killed and destroyed the family of any palestinian freedom fighter it lacks the credibility about the real palestinian struggle and about anything palestinian , however it has something about the suffering of palestinian citizens ending up as refugees in the nearby arab countries , the movie focuses on the story of the man in coma he is now in the present time and through his story we see the film . the movie is just telling the life of one person and has some nudity scenes which are irrelevant to the story.

let me first just say that in the past, i have been a huge carlin fan. i think george is one of the smartest people and best comedians on the planet. what made george so great in the past was his ability to look at things in his own twisted way, and give us his unique perspective on those things. it wasn't always meant to be funny, but you always respected his opinions, because they were presented in such a clever way. but you are all diseased is just a long rant. he doesn't give us any unique perspective on anything, he just gives us a long list of stuff that he's p.o.'d at. there is no insight, no cleverness, just an old man complaining for one hour straight about things that we have all complained about. and on top of that, it wasn't even funny. you are all diseased appeals to dumb people who can't handle anything more advanced than something simple and direct. i don't mind anger fueled comedy, but george could have done so much better. i really hope that george carlin's next show will live up to the quality that george has shown in the past.

director / lead actor dutcher revels in this look-at-me film, wherein he attempts to gain worldly acceptance for tarnishing the otherwise very upbeat world of mormon missionaries. some of the acting is fair. but some roles are unrealistic, i.e. the ominous (rather than fatherly) mission president, etc. the film does give a fair look at how some missionaries may struggle with their faith, but the actual missionary program he claims to represent is far from his concept of it, in terms of being upbeat, cohesive, and inspired. the only inspiration i see in this film is dutcher's self-inspiration. the film is slow and boring, and the shooting and screenplay look like a college student project.

okay, i sensed that a film by mormons, about mormons, for mormons would be a disaster waiting to happen, but little did i know how so very painful it would be. a little known fact is that mormons have always made exceptionally fine propaganda films. the church's official cinematic campaign has produced rare and lasting gems that transcend the mormon community, including the wonderful short film "cipher in the snow" which ended up making the rounds as an educational film in the late 70's. then there's neil labute's disturbingly masterful ouvre....however, the success of these films depended largely on the fact that they didn't focus on mormons or any specific mormon theology. instead they opt to focus on a universal theme and deal with it on a basic human level. "god's army" abandons any pretext of universality and runs headlong into the stilted and myopic world of the orthodox. while this might be enough to alienate anyone but the most devoted mormon, director richard ductcher's ineptitude as a filmmaker and his juvenile approach to storytelling are sufficient grounds to judge "god's army" unwatchable by almost any standard.dutcher's own appallingly wooden acting sets the tone for his army of the least interesting mormons you're ever likely to meet. of course the cast's sorry performances aren't helped any by dutcher's pathetic script. he should be given credit for not avoiding some of the more controversial aspects of the church, but, as can be expected, he conveniently frames these controversies in a sympathetic light. it should also come as no surprise that most of the answers to the church's darker side are addressed with little other than faith. at one point an african-american missionary is scolded by a black couple for joining a church that was segregated up until 1978 (some ten to twenty years after nearly every congregation in the most degenerate parts of the deep south had already done so). instead of addressing the church's actively racist history, perhaps the sorest spot in mormon theology which even church leaders don't defend anymore, dutcher's troubled character instead ponders joseph smith's murder--an obvious and perhaps outrageous allusion to lynching. top off this syruppy milktoast with third grader leper jokes passing as comic relief and you have a strong case for the revival of silent films.if you knew little about mormons before watching this film, you might become prone to avoiding them at all costs. if you are mormon, this film offers absolutely nothing to be proud about.

this movie has a look and feel of many "fresh" directors (closeups and focus on the emotions being experienced by the actors). the point of the film was presented from many angles and expressed well by the relatively inexperienced cast. the point being "have faith in jesus christ and the morman church" oh, and if you read or hear anything contrary to the teachings of the prophet, it is just haterade. (fuel for hatred)

a dull stroll through the banalities of mormon prosthelatizing. utterly un-funny. a testament to the widely held theory, that in order for bathroom humor to be funny, it must necessarily be vulgar; it also bolsters the claim that a close relationship with jesus makes you not funny. more propaganda than film, don't worry about any touchy social issues coming up at the dinner table after this one. the saving grace of this movie is its accurate portrayal of young mormon females as particularly attractive. oh well, its your $7.50.

the movie is nice well pictured, but no originality...this movie is directly copied from "the hitch" where salman plays like a date dr. like will smith, and govinda like some fat jerk, who is desperate to get in love with her boss by the end the movie comes to an old indian flimi style, the bride's father doesn't like the bride's lover and gets some other groom, and govinda the bride's lover comes in the end and saves her from the new groom and a fancy dance and stuff.the comedy was real good, no doubt when the hitch meets hindi would be more funnier....ultimately worth a watch but when it comes on tv after few months...

i watched this movie only coz it was expected to be yet another entertainer by david dhawan. bad bad comeback by david dhawan.he has made lots of funny movies in past which made no sense but none of them was a crap bag!! what a waste of talent and beauty it was?donno why actors agree on doin movie like this.there was not a whit of practicality in this movie.the movie is below par and not at all justifies the standard and potential bollywood has.the only thing worth watching in this movie was katrina but we don't need to watch a movie like this to see her! being a remake of hollywood flick hitch its clear that bollywood directors cant even make a proper remake. i consider this to be the worst ever movie i hv seen. awful 1/10

i was really geared up to watch when two of best movie critics tagged this movie as a 'laugh riot'. but the movie turned out be disappointing.you will be advised to watch this movie keeping your brains at home but you simply can't ignore the flaws and the shortcomings.1. the missile scene was total stupidity.2. katrina kaif and govinda pair looked awful. (he's 49 and she's just 24... more than double of her age) 3. salman's comedy is less of acting and more of overacting.4. songs are good but interrupts the pace of the movie.5. some scenes were deliberately attempted by the movie makers to be funny, and 6. poor and flawed story.however, there are few pluses- 1. govinda. great individual performance.2. some scenes are actually quite funny.3. kattrina kaif. looks and acting keeps on improving with every film.4. rajpal yadav's don sequences. though under-utilized but hilarious.so 4 good points, 6 bad ones.. this one gets 4/10.

i didn't know what to expect when i started watching this movie, by the end of it i was pulling my hairs out. this was one of the most pathetic movies of this year...in fact, in the last ten years. david dhawan should just give up his career as a director. i am yet to come across one original script that david dhawan has worked on. this one was a complete bit y bit rip off hitch. i have nothing against remakes as such, but this one is just so lousy that it makes you even hate the original one (which was pretty decent). i fail to understand what actors like salman and govinda saw in this script. i read somewhere, that this was supposed to be govinda's comeback vehicle. if thats true, then only god can save his career. salman just overacted to the hilt. govinda who i think is an actor of very high caliber was completely wasted. katrina kaif and lara dutta had nothing to do apart form wearing designer clothes and smiling for no rhyme or reason. please stay away form this one!

if you are planning to watch 'partner' and are on imdb reading reviews about it, you have already wasted too much time over this stupid, idiotic, awful movie.it's a horrible, horrible, horrible copy of the movie 'hitch.' i choose to ignore all the other warnings and bad reviews i had heard about this movie, and wasted a precious 20 minutes on it - i thought that after all its david dhawan who is making it, and it has govinda - how bad can it be? but after 20 minutes of watching this nonsense, i couldn't take it any more, and turned off my computer.overacting by everyone in the movie, stupid dialogues, total time waste - i gave it a 1-star rating because that's the lowest you can do. if i could go lower, i would have given it a -100 rating.

david dhawan copied hitch and such an unofficial copy the film isn't even 1/2 as funny or amusing as the original it's boring with forced stories like the lara track of having a child and no hubby plus there is an unwanted stupid chota don and david tries to choke drama too but the film looks disjointed, boringsongs just pop in, so does romance and everything barring some funny govinda scenes, the dance before interval nothing else is worth mentioning the last few scenes are quite funny but there tend to get too longdavid's direction is as bad as maine pyaar kyun kiyaa, he needs to change his style or attempt something good music is saving grace, some songs are good but the situations seem forcedgovinda looks overweight and seems too loud and screams his lines in initial reels but he gets into the groove and gives his best in the office and the scene with salman in his cabin and towards the endsalman just plays himself and his nasal tone plus his fake style of acting is a headachelara is avoidable, katrina is fake as usualthe kid overacts

i just don't know how this stupid, crap, junk, garbage & good for nothing film is a blockbuster. it was so boring with a very, very weak (or no) story-line and wasn't even a jot funny. the film was about 135 minutes of only a paragraph of story about prem (salman khan) is a love guru and is helping hapless & romantic bhaskar (govinda) to get the girl he wants. i'm not saying that i didn't like the film because it wasn't funny or anything, i will accept a movie that is not funny but has a decent story. the only two reasons why i can say it's a super-hit are: 1. salman khan & govinda are on-screen together but there first time together was in salaam e ishq which was a flop so it can't be. but it was a really good movie.2. salman khan's name is prem and all the films with that name have been a hit including maine pyar kiya. so it's just luck.i heard that it's a remake of hitch, i've not seen it & i'm glad i didn't. music is ok the only good songs are do you want a partner, you're my love & soni de nakhre but what is the use of it in a really bad film, that too, if you have someone like katrina kaif who dances with two left feet? she is completely crap. neither she knows acting, language (her voice is always dubbed for her), dance and always fails to impress. i do not like her one bit she was even disappointing in koffee with karan. overall partner is a disposable film with a disposable actress katrina kaif. its better off that she is kicked out of bollywood and never comes back again.

soon after this movie was released,salman khan was handed over a 6 year imprisonment.(read further to know why am i mentioning this.)and i heaved a sigh of relief.not that i was happy that he got jail for something which because he was a celeb but i was happy cus this meant no more salman khan movies,no more his histrionics and no more over hyped acting(read overacting).this movie made no sense whatsoever. the scene where the kid belonging to one of the family makes a rocket which was voice activated .according to the movie script it would chase anyone.but ultimately it finds only salman khan bare chested. well this is what happened.the rocked gets activated in another foolish way and you have to have an iq of .001 to believe that. then it chases salman khan ,who was on his water scooter and the chase continues unless he is done with all the possible stunts he could show to foolish audience. (in my regard all those people who have given this movie 5 and above ,unless they are paid to do that.)another of breath taking ,unbelievable scene was at the end when all the arrangements about the marriage is made and salman khan with govinda in disguise comes and stall the marriage by another of those highly unwanted songs .later on even though everything is done and ready a mere confession of govinda and katrina kaif to katrina's father and bingo . everything is fine and govinda marries kartina....this made me wonder if convincing was so easy why did not they do that and tortured us for so many hours and wasted my money.this movie is must avoid and don't even think it had any scene worth watching . the plot is way too disconnected with characters popping from no where and ultimately vanishing..for ex choota don...what a waste of characters.after this movie i took a pledge that i would not watch salman khan movies for the rest of my life unless it wins an oskar...(hahahah...which means i would never watch)

this is not a good movie. it is a tried remake of the english movie 'the hitch'. but it insults the original one. this is hardly a movie you expect from a veteran director like 'david dhawan' who is credited to directing good movies like "raja babu", "coolie no.1", "hero no. 1"...the main theme for this movie is taken from "the hitch" with some changes so as to appeal to the indian audience but somehow the story and the screenplay is not convincing enough. plus the acting from the lead roles i.e. salman khan and govinda is pitiful. it seems that they need the slightest provocation to remove their shirts to reveal their bare chest. i do not consider this fascinating and least of all comic. what was the director thinking ? added to this the viewers have to bear the case of govinda's over-acting. it was simply unbearable. i advise the viewers to watch it at your own risk. my rating of 2 for this movie could be considered to be a very generous one.instead i would advise the viewers to watch the english movie "hitch" which is a lot better.

this is another bollywood remake of a hollywood movie. hitch...if i'm correct.the film has some great moments which will have you laughing out loud which frankly only come from govinda who has become a legend within indian cinema and will always bring his a game in terms of comedies. another bonus is rajpal yadav; who is hilarious as the gangster who mimics 'don', an indian icon of cinema. lara dutta is a plus...i know i sound shallow but its mainly because i have a soft spot for her, she tries to be funny but its seems to be forced. her acting is weak...but she still shines. salman khan is atrocious, he tries to bring the cool, charming depths but fails miserably, he over acts and keeps shouting for no apparent reason. 'thats not acting mate, thats called being mentally challenged'katrina kaif is just bad...not very good at anything. no charisma, no talent..and i don't see why people consider her pretty... the plot was far fetched and i had a hard time believing that katrina's character was remotely attracted to govinda. the only good thing is the music...'you're my love' was the best in the soundtrack.

talk about over acting...!!!! not just by govinda, but also by salman and lara....the direction was awful. the first half hour you would pretty much want to switch the movie off..because this movie is a real stinker (mark my words. i liked govinda in some o his comedy roles like haseena maan jaayegi, jodi no. 1, akhiyon se goli maare and jis desh mein ganga rehta hai and this does not compare to any of them. and salman khan should not do comedy roles at all!! he sucks. he does not know how to do comedy. the only good comedy role he did was in andaz apna apna, which was brilliant next to amir khan. there were so many 'overly done stupidly unfunny' scenes in this movie that make you want to take out the dvd and burn it so no one else in your house watches it ever again.

there wasn't a 0 in the voting option so i was compelled to use the next available figure.it is a sad day for bollywood when such type of movies which have star-cast actors is nothing more are than a bunch of juvenile acting, and an awful script.this movie is nowhere near to be called a clone of hitch. salman khan with his usual take-off-you-shirt theme and govinda with his in-humorous laughs. if somebody had told 2 decades ago that i would be writing a comment on salman (after his success with maine pyar kiya), i would have written him/her off.

honestly, i have to admit that i go and see certain stupid films based on the hype they have generated or are currently generating. this dumb salman khan & govinda feature is one of those stupid films. okay, by now we've all seen 'hitch' starring will smith as a date doctor trying to help out odd people find true. then why would we need to see salman khan re-enact this? therein lies the $64,000 question. in case you were wondering, govinda plays the oddball in search of the love of his life (an unreachable socialite) played by katrina kaif.lara dutta is along to play sallu's eva mendes, and sallu's real-life love kaif pretty much plays her character like every role you've see her in thus far, no stretch no acting required. and for nearly three and a half hours we get tortured with spoofs of other bollywood films and characters or better yet we get treated to low rate performances of past hit films. rajpal yadav co-stars. f

it is incredible that there were two films with the same story released in 2005. this one came out a day before that other one with tom cruise. didn't they do that with truman capote the same year, and the zodiac killer last year? interesting.writer/director david michael latt didn't have steven spielberg's budget and c. thomas howell is not tom cruise. this is a pale imitation of the blockbuster that grossed $588 million worldwide.the action was minimal and most of the time we were treated to the whining of rhett giles, who played a pastor that was giving up on his god.gary busey was creepy as an army lt.

why does c thomas howell do these movies? cruise (howell's one time co-star) does a huge blockbuster of wotw and howell follows with this lame effort.where do i start here? production values - i'll start with the good stuff. the look and feel of some of the scenes in this movie are not too bad to be honest. the set-ups are okay in spots and the direction not too bad.script - terrible. a series of clunky scenes that could have been put in any order you like permeate throughout the movie. the amount of times the scene faded to black and reemerged a second later in the same room was uncountable. very poor storyline (but so was the cruise wotw) takes some blame but an abysmal screenplay kills it off.special fx - okay, i don't want to be too harsh here as i imagine the budget was smaller than cruise's lunch bill - but in the overall context of the film the effects are badly done. some shots are quite impressive - mainly far off destruction shots of bridges, washington, liner. but in the main the "alien" machines and tentacles themselves are dreadful. also the camera quality is fuzzy on some shots and cuts away entirely on others.acting - i'm a fan of howell but as he has reduced himself to acting in these low-budget flicks - he has succumbed to the "over-acting" bug a long time ago. look at his performance in the hitcher and compare it to this movie. there is no comparison. he overdoes his facial expressions, his flailing arms and legs (where did he get that running style???) and for a final coup-de-gras look at the scene where he loses the photo of his family. hysterical. but after saying all that - he is still the best actor on show here. busey is embarrassing to look at and peter green (zed is truly dead now baby) mumbles incoherently through his one and only scene. i honestly could not understand one word he said - i even went so far as trying to enable the subtitles on that scene - but the dvd did not have subtitles. this seems to be a real keep-it-in-the-family affair too as howell's son, the director's wife and the line producer all make it into the film. none of them are good.direction - not bad but not good either.score - dismal.overall, a lame duck effort that will do nothing for howell in his attempt to make it back to the big time. he should take a look at rourke and try to figure out how he made in back to the a list but if he keeps doing stuff like this, he won't have a career soon enough.3/10.

one of my favorite "bum" actors, c. tom howell, stars in this tepid remake of wotw. he runs around a lot, while a cgi-generated spider-like machine goes around killing everyone. the budget for this one obviously was pretty low. it also was one of the asylum productions. have you seen any of those? yikes! i am not sure why anyone would have made this while the big-budget spielberg version was slaying them at the box office. and if truth be told, neither version is all that hot. the george pal version from the 1950s remains the best representation of the h.g. wells novel, primitive special effects and all. perhaps because gene barry was much more convincing in the lead than howell or tom cruise.

it is hard to imagine anyone making a tom cruise film look good; hard indeed, but this one makes him look good. very good. actually, it makes him look like sir john gielgud celebrating very good acting day with a bravura performance.the acting from the entire ensemble struggled to rise above the risible and failed. the fault was, in part let us be fair, that the plot bore as much resemblance to the hg wells original as did the butchered carcasses of the human victims in the film to their living predecessors: both were bloodied and violated remnants of more attractive predecessor. but to describe a plot such as this to be a bit holy is to say of the colander "my, this kitchen utensil has a remarkable lot of holes", unless, that is, holes are your bag; in which case this film will commend itself to you.the fault in the other part was that these were demotivated, jobbing, dvd actors who knew full well, one assumes, that this was their exhibition that would wind up on the $5 dvd shelf. and overpriced at that.so should you watch it? why yes, of course, you should. you are a miserable sinner and deserve punishment.

my paraphrase above of the slogan on the back of the dvd box sums it up: this film was far more horrible than horrifying.this is the worst film i have seen in as long as i can remember. my wife accidentally rented it thinking it was the tom cruise version. the laughably crude special effects on the menu screen should have tipped us off. the gratuitous nudity already in the opening scene made us more suspicious.but as the film wore on, we were benumbed by clumsy acting -- both over- and under-acting -- non-continuity in directing and editing, trite writing, and crude special effects. we gave up after a half-hour or less; after starting this badly, it couldn't possibly get better.since i despise reviews that pan a product without giving specifics, here are some examples of the film's especially awkward moments, even if they amount to spoilers:- the lead says good-bye to his young old son as the latter is about to drive away with his mother, the latter prickly because it's their wedding anniversary but the lead is not coming along due to sudden business. the son asks, quietly worried, "will i ever see you again?" perhaps it's supposed to come off as a premonition, but it instead comes off as incongruous behavior for a child that age in that situation.- a huge alien spacecraft has crashed to earth and sits in an enormous crater. a crowd of people stands nearby, peering at it uneasily but otherwise looking generally unaroused. one woman finally says "it's gi-normous!"- after this craft has laid waste a village and its inhabitants, the lead and a bystander, now alone near their homes and trying to load their cars for an escape, have an exchange something like this, in a quietly puzzled tone:"what was that thing, anyway?" "i dunno..."- a crowd attempting to evacuate over a bridge is blocked by the military, since part of the bridge is destroyed. when an alien ship shoots an explosive at it, the crowd starts to run away, seemingly only because a director told them to and not because they're frightened or in any kind of real danger, let alone unusual circumstances.and so forth... writing about the film falls short of the experience of actually seeing it. but please, please, save yourself the bother, even if your morbid curiosity is piqued! the film is so bad it can't even be enjoyed as unintentional humor (versus, say, king vidor's "solomon & sheeba" starring yul brynner wearing a wig). life is too short to waste watching such nonsense. there must be something more productive and enjoyable to do, like walking the dog or cleaning a birdcage.

this movie is so bad they should burn the master. you cant spoil the plot because this movie doesn't have one. the graphics are less than fake, they're horrendous. then you've got the rambling through the countryside star gazer work-a-holic who bounces between his own lunacy & the mad rantings of the crazed preacher. & when he finally makes it to dc, they don't even have the decency to kill him; the monster (which you don't know at the time) is already dieing but how ... who knows & of course it has the ultimate sappy ending... everybody else on the planet is dead or dieing but his family & a handful of stragglers survive. imagine that! this will be the movie that c thomas howell will go to his grave regretting he ever starred in. it probably gives him nightmares.

after watching the steven spielberg version of war of the worlds in theaters, i was hooked on the topic. i could think back to my favorite parts in the movie, people getting vaporized, people panicking, fire, explosions, it was all so great...so a few weeks later i enter my video store, and i see david michael latt's version of war of the worlds on the shelf. "it couldn't have come onto dvd, that fast, could it?" i said to myself. i read the back of the case and saw c. thomas howell, instead. "oh, i remember him from the outsiders!" so i thought, it might have been a try.i was wrong, dead wrong. as soon as i watched the opening credits, watched them take forever, i knew something was wrong. something was going to disappoint me in this film and it did. the whole movie stunk like a cheese sauce that was left in the fridge for 10 years. from the acting, the special effects (stupid looking tripod things, when people get vaporized they turn into orange skeletons), and most of all, it didn't even come close to being as interesting as the spielberg version, in fact, the plot was boring, and there were only 3 scenes of destruction! what the crap? i ended up being so bored, that i had to fast forward through the movie until i found something that looked even remotely interesting. and nothing was really.my advice: don't even touch this movie, stay 100 feet away from it. the spielberg version is coming out near the end of this month, buy that one! but please, please, i beg of you! stay away from this turd before it smothers us all!

this movie looked like the out-takes of the deleted scenes from a high school film class experiment. it made no sense! it was well acted, but i only felt sorry for the characters because they had to appear in this slop. the alien machines were created with pentium i technology and no creativity, they were crabs! the under-lit and barely seen aliens were frisbees with legs. where were the tripods? the editing, done by director/writer/producer/make-up artist/gripper latt, jumps all over the place, with some scenes repeated numerous times. most of it seemed to have been filmed in the wake of hurricane katrina. the next time latt wants to make a movie, someone needs to slap him. in 2005 alone he produced 11 movies! that doesn't include the writing, editing, directing or visual effects credits on other movies. if the rest are like this snot-load, then he's just making fun of us. this was a slapped together rip-off of spielberg's movie, nothing more. i'm looking forward to latt's "backbroke ridge', "x-man iiv", "the hillocks have eyes."

i wish i could have given this a zero. sure i'll admit that i also mistakenly picked this up thinking it was the spielberg version. a clever marketing ploy releasing it at this time and being prominently displayed at the video store. however, i was willing to give it a go anyhow - i wish i wouldn't have.where do i start? i have read some of the other reviews here and have to say i disagree with anyone who thinks any of the acting was good - sorry even c. thomas howell stunk. none of the performances were any good. not a one.even if the acting was decent the dialog is terrible! "ginormus" and "dick skinners" just doesn't really cut it.now as for the story well - it was terribly adapted and must have been edited by a 5 year old. the main character is constantly running into situations that are way convenient - or at least appear that way due to how the film was edited together. for example he is trying to get to a place called new hope to find his brother. during a brief break someone just randomly hands him the directions to new hope. what the hell is that? when he gets to new hope he just happens to stumble onto his dying brother. then there is the part where he has been traveling away from his destination for days and just happens to come across the car his wife and son were traveling in. he was going in a different direction then they were how did that car end up where he was? he has a black back pack that randomly appears and disappears throughout the film. there are parts of the film where the characters are just waking up in the morning and then two seconds later it is night - or worse yet dusk of the next day. i also can't forget the main character and the preacher falling through the floor of a house for no reason - we don't find out until later that an alien has landed on the house. which reminds me of the moment when they are walking and suddenly find themselves standing under an alien they didn't notice. what the hell, the aliens are like two stories tall with huge bodies and multiple legs - how could they miss it? there is one point where an alien kills a random citizen, supposedly by spitting some kind of junk at him - but you never see the stuff fly it just appears on the guys face. the special effects in general are terrible. the entire movie is like a bad "train wreck". when we finally get to the end, after this guy trying to get to dc to find his family, they just appear. no searching no asking questions nothing. just oh there you are i am so happy - the end.i am sorry if my review rambles a bit but this movie was so bad i had a hard organizing my contempt. please save yourself the time and don't watch this sneakily displayed pile of cinematic stench. it is quite possibly the worst film i have ever witnessed. i would rather have been getting a root canal - it would have been less painful.

i am not a big fan of the spielberg/cruise version of this film. and so i must throw in with the more humble latt/howel version. c thomas howel had more heart and more sympathy that cruise in the lead role (at least in my opinion). now this is hard to imagine until you strip away everything thing in the spielberg version that cost more than a thousand dollars. there would be nothing left, no special effects, no sets, no cruise. because i doubt that anything cost more than a cool grand in the david michael latt version. so, comparing apples to turnips i guess i have to go with the turnips. at least it gives independent movies a shot at the epic science fiction disaster market.

h.g. wells' war of the worlds by director david michael latt is a slightly less-than-average flick which isn't too bad if one considers the budget he had to work with - only $1 million. for this budget, the production value wasn't too bad - the best part of it is the visual effects (i was thoroughly impressed with the cgi considering the budget) and sound design. the less-then-stellar parts of this film are the story which is very prolonged at best (but again i think this is because of the budget they had - they had to prolong certain scenes to create the feature length 97 minutes), the acting (again it's because the actors had no story to work with), very few exceptional camera shots, and the music. however, again, i can let the negative parts go for the most part only because this film was made for a meager budget and still had good production value. still you should,d see it for the sake of seeing how a low budget version of war of the worlds can be made even with flaws. 4 out of 10.

while it has been many decades since i last read mr. wells "war of the worlds", or "the time machine", or any other of his works, i believe that they were all set in london, or at least, in england. this grade "b" ("c"?) movie is set in the eastern part of the united states as was orson welles excellent radio adaptation 67 years ago. however, this film exhibits none of the quality of the narrative style of the mercury playhouse program. thomas howell's emoting would not be acceptable in most high school drama clubs. i was actually embarrassed for him. his rolling around in the grass on the hill crying "my family, my family" was almost laughable, as was his reaction to the death of his brother. of the three film versions of the story that i have seen, this was by far the worst, with gene barry's 1950's version the best. additionaally, this was the first time i ever saw a "machine monster" dripping sticky saliva such as did the creature in the "alien".

i felt like i was watching an example of how not to make a movie. i think the director filmed it in his back yard! there was no real plot. terrible script.terrible acting.the worst production i have ever witnessed. a couple of bad cg effects and then the rest of the movies was spent walking around in what looked like a junk yard.i don't normally write reviews to movies but was moved to warn everyone about this one.life is to short to waste your time with this movie!

spoilers****this is tenchi?this is not tenchi.practically everyone is written horribly out of character ... when it comes to characterization, the only bright spot is the friendship between ayeka and ryoko.also, the villainess is not punished for her actions, which amount to mind-control rape. if a male villain had done to one of the women what haruna does to tenchi, then he would have (rightfully so) painfully bought it at the end of the movie, dying horribly, and the audience would have cheered. but not only does haruna pay no price for her crimes, ryoko actually forgives and understands her actions. no! the real ryoko would have disintegrated her for what haruna had done to her beloved tenchi; the audience i saw this with, myself included, all booed audibly at this sceneanime fans, avoid this movie. tenchi fans, avoid this movie even harder.

"tenchi muyo in love 2" is the third tenchi movie. it seemed that its creators took elements from the first two to make this one. at the risk of giving out spoilers, tenchi is kidnapped and the team has to get him back. nothing new there. a past love of yosho's is the bad guy. that was done in the second movie. the battle between aeka and ryoko and is starting to get boring. the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy. i personally don't know what aic, it's makers, were thinking. i gave this movie a vote of 4.

there were but two reasons for me to see this film. first of all stellan skarsgard and marisa tomei were in it (who are both good actors) and i had nothing better to do. while seeing the film though, i immediately thought of something better to do: sleep! this film is a complete waste of time. it is a standard ex-cop flick. the ex-copper is the best there ever was, but he was fired. he keeps doing stuff on his own to the dislike of his former buddies and he saves the day. all big surprises (not!!!). go to sleep, or if you have insomnia, try this one.4 out of 10

the perfect 6 step recipe for a boring middle of the road movie:1. take one burnt-out, rogue ex-cop with a bad attitude, yet a sensitive touch as well (closet concert pianist with a pet cat);2. add some "cool" retro gadgets like a beat-up porsche 356, a roaring bike, a heavily patched leather jacket and a pair of cowboy boots with holes in the soles;3. mix in a couple of "free-spirit" locations e.g. a trendy sea-side apartment and a dedicated diner booth for an office;4. spice it up with "deep" socio-romantic themes such as a post-divorce-traumatized-but-finally-remarrying-ex-wife, a secretly-admiring-and-therefore-forgiving-waitress, a pair-of-former-colleague-cops-only-one-of-whom-is-really-a-complete-jerk and a best-buddy-getting-iced-over-a-suitcase-full-of-illegal-$$$;5. let it simmer for about 90 minutes in a "fast-paced" though not necessarily logical or internally consistent sequence of mediocre action scenes, cheap tender moments and sluggish wise-cracks;6. serve with either a comfortable pillow to sleep straight through it all or something a bit more interesting (don't worry: even the yellow pages will do!).

wow...reading through these comments, i see a remarkable socio-cultural clash theme emerging between the us and ... the dutch! the us p.o.v. appears to be that this is quite a good little movie, parker being a likable hero, the story a light-hearted rendition of what could be a glorified form of reality.all three dutch reviewers view the world through a totally different pair of glasses it seems. they categorically and in surprisingly similar terms agree the movie is a disaster.far be it from me to take sides in what appears to be a dispute between cultures, on this item as wide apart as the ocean that separates them geographically. still, based on factual observation - i saw the movie with my very own eyes - i suspect the dutch are not too far off the mark: "parker kane" is poorly made, utterly boring, and really not worth the celluloid that was no doubt wasted in its creation.

poor old robert taylor. other than the feds, nothing much has gone his way - this almost-shocker is a wasteful ninety minutes and not much more. it's one of those cheesy detective-crime flicks with the narrative of the lead character the whole way through - usually that's reserved for comedies these days but this film takes itself way too seriously! a pity; australian films, particularly in the 2000-01 periods, have been of exceptional quality overall - but i suppose there have got to be a few misses. why even make a film like this, that obviously isn't going to be any good?

the funniest thing about fortunes is that one of the main characters, lewis (urbaniak) has writer's block and apparently so did the screenplay writer for the film. this is sad, as well, as i guess by large, this is supposed to be a comedy, or dramedy, but that's the funniest thing i can remember from watching this.three friends go out and drink one night. on the way home, two decide to get their fortunes told by a "gypsy," as they call her. those two lives fall apart while the third friend stands by. then, nothing happens.i hope i didn't spoil the movie there, but really, this extremely low-budget, bad quality movie had some kind of idea when it started but quickly snowballed into the depths of hell. yeah, i'm being harsh. honestly, it wasn't that bad, it was just blah.the aforementioned writer was annoying to watch, though he delivered maybe one or two of the only two funny lines. the clichéd "ladies man," the only one that didn't get his fortune told was just annoying. the only bright spot, was the remaining friend, the married dad whose fortune was told that something big was to happen to his son and he needed to be prepared. he was funny, genuine and clearly the best actor in the movie. unfortunately, that's not saying much.perhaps i'm being too cruel. heck, they got the ambition to make a movie, went and got funding and accomplished something. unfortunately, however, i can't at all recommend the film on the basis, there's hundreds of thousands of other independent movies that have hundreds of thousands better ideas and executions. this one was literally 10 minutes of an idea stretched another 81 boring minutes.

this is just a very bad film. miles looks as if she is in pain during the sex scenes and the acting is wooden. it also drags on slowly and never really finds a point to it all. one of the worst films that i have ever seen!

new year 2006, and i'm watching glimmer man again. say what you like, i find steven seagal's movies amusing. like many comments, good fight sequences - i particularly liked his answering of the phone at the restaurant saying how long it would be closed for restoration. bit like schwarzenegger's humour in the earlier action films - although that tended to be self-deprecating.but the one i like here is brian cox. one of the most versatile actors around. pity about his hand and foot, but so much for withstanding extended interrogation - must have flunked that class at the "farm".as the films went on i wonder just how the ever thickening girth of seagal affected his movement?. never mind, it's entertainment!.

two l.a cops track down a serial killer nicknamed "the family man" who has wiped out whole families and when one of the police officer's wife takes the deep six, questions are raised and it turns out that a serial killer isn't responsible but rather mobsters. the idea of seagal in a serial killer movie is an interesting concept, indeed one could see seagal play a good serial killer however making him a cop who has a ridiculous penchant for prayer beads and razor sharp credit cards comes off more stupid than likably ridiculous. also a running joke involves wayon's enjoyment of eating powdered deer penis and well this raunchy material is utterly out of place. not to mention the beginning of a school being taken hostage, due to a boy's breakup with his girlfriend. after seagal neutralizes him, the girlfriend tells the young lad that she loves him. now there is a lesson to be learned from all of this, if you want your girlfriend back, taking the school hostage may get you back on her good side. i myself would think flowers or the old fashioned phone call might work, then again though, i'm old fashioned. besides who am i to put a damper on somebody else's brilliant reconciliation plan.* out of 4-(bad)

my age: 13james cole, played by steven seagal, is sent to help detective jim campbell, played by keenen ivory wayans, solve a series of killings in which the victims are crucified. since cole has arrived on the spot, he notices that the killings have changed a little, and thinks there is a different killer. it becomes personal when his ex-wife is murdered, and campbell finds his fingerprints on the body. campbell investigates the mysterious cole, and finds out about a very shady past.i am not a fan of steven seagal. i enjoy action movies, but he is the worst actor i have ever seen. this film is not much fun to watch at all, incredibly dumb, and, obviously, steven seagal's acting performance is absolutely horrid. keenen ivory wayans isn't too bad, though. the only redeeming thing in this film is the occasional good action scene, although most come round because of insanely stupid reasons. the plot in this film is absolute gibberish. i didn't care for it at all. the whole "glimmer man" past of seagal's character was stupid, all the mafia fights and fights in the restaurant were there for almost no reason. give this film a miss.australian classification: ma 15+: high level violencerating: 35 out of 100 (quite generous)

the main problem with 9th company (9 rota) is that it is not sure whether it wants to be saving private ryan or full metal jacket. the attempts at spielberg sentimentalism are embarrassing, such as the burley sergeant crying in a field of red flowers!!! the training sequences have none of intensity or realism that kubrick gave them in his masterpiece.a further bone of contention is that the afghan fighters are called ghosts because they strike and are hardly ever seen. here they attack a russian strong hold almost in formation with no attempt to use cover. i am sure tactics have move on since waterloo.every scene in this film has been seen before in other war movies and done considerably better. i have to ask: why do all talented marksmen need to chew on a match?finally, i am always suspicious of a film that starts with no narration yet needs to qualify the end."we won!" ...errrr....... no you didn't.

first, i'm sorry for my english. second, the true story of this episode: 39 soldiers, operation "magistral'". 6 soldiers were killed. hundreds of insurgents were killed too. within 10 years the soviet army has lost less than 15 thousand person and killed over 900000 insurgents and civilians. there is no insurgents without permanent help of usa the veteran of war: "traditions. there are no traditions in this film. there is no military oath, there is no first jump, no farewell to the fighting banner. there is no delivery of awards and medals. there is nothing sacred. there is only a hatred to soviet army. being in this area on investigation, we have revealed start-up jet shells by insurgents . an exact place could not define. so gunners have asked to give easier square. also have covered it. through pair minutes. here it was the reality of fights. so there was no feeling "oblivion". these feelings have appeared then. already on other war and in other state (chechnya). others were children. more kindly. more humanly. and "prapors" were as fathers. well and culmination fight - full orgy. shooting in anywhere. mental attacks young ben-ladens, not killed both not broken through. and full absence of mutual aid. that there was a main thing on this war. even americans accused us of inadequate application of force against insurgents. and here it is direct on the contrary. in the summer 1981 i about myself have firmly solved, that personally should fill up a minimum 50 insurgents. as a result accepted "plan" has been under-fulfilled, and on a demobilization i departed strongly contused and malicious as fig. after returning the first months there was a feeling of that i not was at war up to the end, not business there have completed all how follow. there was any vague, but an oppressive sensation of discontent with itself and caustic irritation. such here night ideas, can be and out of place at all. officers really in film are not present absolutely. in occasion of that, what is the time they spent with staff. on fighting-is constant. new year on fighting. from where did they take beds? in mountains? and so on..."if you want a fairy tale about war, "9 rota" and "shtrafbat" is for you. if you want truth, you must see "come and see" or "batallions ask for fire".

yes, it might be not historically accurate(actually only 6 soldiers of 9th rota were killed there), and yes, it has some mistakes and exaggeration(bended machine gun? come on! or the that "history lesson" about how afghanistan was never conquered by anyone - educated russian officer would know history much better than that - take for example british campaign in afghanistan). and yes, it does not have multi-million dollars hollywood-style special effects, but it's strongest point in showing soldier's life there, their relationships and their feelings when the best friends are being killed in front of their eyes. in my opinion 9ya rota really does a good job showing all those things.again, movie has it weaknesses, but, in my opinion, it appears to be one of the strongest russian movie for the past few years.8/10

this movie was filmed in my hometown and i was acquainted with many of the "actors" in minor rolls. most of them were students at the local karate school and even at the time it was filmed we all knew what a stinker it was. it was interesting however to see it being made. most of the places it was filmed at no longer exist, such as the nightclub, the pizza shop, etc. the "world premiere" was held at the akron civic theatre and we all laughed hysterically at how inane it was. i personally believe it's the worst movie ever made but it brings back many fond memories for me. watch this movie with a word of advice...enjoy it for what it is..a very low budget, poorly made , karate flick.

i can't believe this movie has an average rating of 7.0! it is a fiendishly bad movie, and i saw it when it was fairly new, and i was in the age group that is supposed to like it!

to this day, i have never seen elizabeth shue in anything else because of the stench of this movie. poorly acted, poorly plotted and racially neanderthal, it took place in a chicago where every black person apparently lived in a blues club. . spoiler ahead. . . . . ..spoiler: her "blues" solo was even more painful to watch than her clueless acting and the intro into it - 'nobody leaves without singing the blues' -- was as dumb as a post. the children her character was babysitting were insufferable and well before the movie's end i was wishing for something horrible to happen to all of them.i have to say though, there is one special thing about this movie; it takes a lot for a movie to offend me but this smoldering piece of tripe did what chopper, the phantom menace and catwoman could not -- make me sick to my stomach.

i would not recommend this movie. even though it is rated g and is clearly for kids there is quite a lot of swearing (including the dreaded 'f' and 's' words). this kind of language doesn't offend me particularly but in a kids film? come on.there was also quite a bit of implied sexual content, between one of the early adolescent male characters and any willing adult woman who came along - including a prostitute! the acting was as good as it gets in this genre of film but the story line was very very cheesy and even my four year old remarked that it was 'stupid'.despite having elizabeth shue, this film is definitely not worth checking out if you haven't seen it.

danny is beyond sorry.he keeps making the same mistakes, and is no longer interesting to watch. at first i could feel for him, as an addict myself. my heart went out to him at the beginning, and somewhere along the line he went over the line. it is almost as if he is continuing this behavior to keep the show going, and at the same time is seriously risking his life, and the welfare of his family, especially his children. it is difficult even to have pity for the poor boy. i think he needs to watch this show, maybe then he might have a chance a saving this marriage. i can't understand how gretchen stays with him, and i keep wondering how much is just for show, and how much is love. danny, get a life - a new one that is! ...and don't get me started on dr. gary. what is with him and his face? his skin looks like it's stretched to the max. besides that, looks don't mean a thing, yet he seems not to be particularly impartial. i think, he too, is keeping this going for his own monetary gain and often not in the best interests of either gretchen or danny. these people are few confused and each remind me of a dog chasing its tail. sad, very sad. c'mon pull yourselves together.

excellent example of the disaster that happens when you combine a challenging script with two actors chosen for physical appeal. it is rare for me to be consciously aware of the acting during the first viewing of a movie because i try to just go with the story and save the analysis for the second viewing. in the case of "full ride", the acting was so weak that the movie was impossible to appreciate as a story; i was too busy (during first and only viewing) alternating between laughter and nausea.fortunately for most individual members of the cast, pretty much everyone in the ensemble is weak, the individual talent limitations do not contrast with any actual competent acting. riley smith and meredith monroe are at least well matched physically, finding common ground in looking far too old for the credible age of their characters.unfortunately the script requires especially intense and convincing performances to portray their characters which just exposes smith and monroe's staggering lack of talent. on the positive side, they know enough to not look directly into the camera and they do not stutter.better to have used a less attractive pair who could physically pass for the proper age. the basic story is not particularly original, just another variation on "an officer and a gentleman", but it would have provided a nice showcase for a talented pair of "teenage" actors.then again, what do i know? i'm just a child.

this may well be the worst remake hollywood has ever produced, and that's saying something. i'll take it further than that and say this movie is so stunningly, deliriously bad that it must be seen. i don't know if i'm even capable of tackling all the things wrong with it--like the fact that the casting director appears to have pulled names out of a hat, or the mind-blower of richard gere's character being allowed to walk away scot-free at the end (i'm sure the people saying, "it's just fiction, who cares" would have no problem if it was a former al-qaeda operative who just wants to return to his home country)--so i'll just devote my review to the utter hilarity, which is mainly the scene where bruce willis is testing out his gun. in the original version, you'll recall, the jackal practices his kill on a pumpkin. the pumpkin explodes on impact, an effect known as "understatement." in this version, willis sets up a pumpkin target, but he doesn't use a sniper rifle--he uses a gigantic remote-controlled cannon which costs tens of thousands of dollars and can only be stored in the back of a huge conspicuous minivan (this man likes a challenge). he reveals the cannon by pulling away a tarp, at which point jack black, who is there to observe, jumps around and says, "that rocks! this thing rocks!" about 18 times (i guess willis didn't have to disassemble it first, he just lifted it, tarp and all, out of the back of the van, despite it probably weighing several tons). the scene then turns into an austin powers movie as willis misses the pumpkin and takes out a tree, then has black run through the mud with his pants falling down, finally blowing off black's entire arm. the pumpkin falls to the ground, unharmed. if i can recommend this movie for one non-ironic reason, it's for the diane venora character as a tough russian major who becomes romantically linked to gere despite having a facial disfigurement--a bold move for a hollywood feature. by mid- movie i was really liking this character, so it was a shame when she had to be killed. i would have liked to see a movie about her. other than that, this pile of crap is only useful as an objective intelligence test. 3/10.

spoilers!! bruce willis, the part-time comic and funny guy plays a hispanic assassin nicknamed after an african scavenger prairie dog? i guess all the good hispanic nicknames like sicatriz (scar), scorpion, viper, cobra, snake, tarantula, latigo (whip), navaja (blade), etc. were not available?? and why would some south american assassin be acquainted with a terrorist from the irish republican army?? last time i checked, the ira is not looking to open any branch headquarters in south america. and why would some prison-tough, battle-weary irish terrorist look like a middle-aged richard gere? i thought maybe this movie was going to be a spoof of "the crying game" when gere's character was introduced as the person who was going to hunt down "the jackal." what bad casting! and why would the fbi be hiring depraved terrorists in order to track down assassins?? it seems like a terrorist goes for mass destruction, and an assassin usually hits one target in a non-spectacular manner. but gere is the only person who has ever seen willis alive, according to the fbi. i thought this movie was supposed to be a remake of the very great film "day of the jackal" but this movie is just a dumber version of "assassins" with stallone and banderas. both of these movies are really dumb, and part of the dumb-ness is the fact that as the audience we are forced to watch bruce willis go through his routines and we should say "wow! isn't he smart!" the professional with jean reno was a much better movie about assassins. "the jackal" is just a movie about two fat middle-aged millionaire actors who could get paid for standing around looking pretty and pretending to be smart! "the jackal" is so poor, that i expected to see sly stallone, dennis rodman, mickey rourke, and jean clod van dumme making cameo appearances as "other" hitmen or fbi. needless to say, "the jackal" has eluded the fbi for twenty-five years, but as soon as richard gere gets on the job, it is only a few days before "the jackal" is kaput! i guess the positive message of this movie is, "thanks to terrorists, our streets are safe from assassins." overall, the "jackal" has no redeeming qualities.

laughably awful. one might think that all the big-name actors involved in this movie would at least make it believable, but they do not--this one is a stinker.characters either sprint around without having a good reason to know where they are going, or they stand around making constipated faces when they should be running for their lives.check your higher brain functions at the door if you intend to try watching this movie. or, get a bunch of your most clever friends together and give this one the "mystery science theater 3000" treatment. that's what i was doing through the second half of this turkey.and please don't confuse this with the excellent movie "the day of the jackal," a far-superior thriller from 30 years ago.

this is movie is really bad. i like to flip on the tv while napping and this movie looked like it would be something good to sleep through, and boy was i wrong. my body literally woke me up from sleeping and said "hey... this movie is awful... you gotta watch it". i love bad movies with bad actors and stupid plots. something about unintentional comedy gets me going. this movie is impressively crappy. i really don't know how to properly express it aside from recommending you watch it just to see how bad it is. i mean, seriously, you should watch it with people. i was making the best jokes outloud during this movie and no one was there to hear them.worse than swimfan. it's that bad.

amidst all the many problems that make this a dire piece of celluloid is the stupidest plot device in recent cinema history. richard gere determines who the jackal's real target is through some form of revelation. he does not work anything out, it just comes to him. when in doubt "he's going after the first lady!". this film blows chunks.

roll up! roll up! it's big gay bruce and his big gay death cannon! plausible plot? unnecessary! decent acting? unnecessary! respect shown to its mighty progenitor? unnecessary! yes it's another offensively stuffed turkey in the butch bruce canon.i mean where do you start with this film? okay, let's begin with the woeful misapprehension people might have that this was, in some way, related to either the book or the original film, the day of the jackal. it's not. in fact it's so different (and so bad) that fredrick forsyth asked to have his name taken off it. now i'm not necessarily a stuffy brit who can't hack hollywood remaking british films. well, okay, maybe i am a bit like that, but fortunately it's a redundant point in this case. this film is so different to the original that the name and the odd reference are the only things that survive.now let's move to the premise. cheesy russian gangster gets killed in a moscow police raid (somehow involving the fbi although no one bothers to explain why). in revenge, brother of gangster decides to wreak vengeance by killing the wife of the us president (although again no one bothers to explain why this is a good move  although to be fair it was pre-9-11, so he wasn't to know it would have resulted in the us airforce carpet bombing eastern europe). gangster hires "nasty" killer (willis). police hire "cuddly" killer (gere), "cuddly" killer tracks "nasty" killer. police fanny around and periodically get killed. "cuddly" killer kills "nasty" killer. first lady is saved and we all realise that the ira are just this bunch of real sweet guys y'know, who just happen to want to kill innocent people. nice.let's put to one side the distasteful hollywood habit of playing in the troubles of northern ireland like it was a sandpit in a theme park (i deal with this point more extensively on the message boards). if hollywood directors want to cast the belfast butchers as hookers with hearts of gold, that's up to them. i, of course, reserve the right to despise them for it. it's a free country.more egregious, however, is the fact that the film manages to patronise and insult the irish while trying to support them. that's not politically distasteful, it's far worse: it's incompetent. it's no wonder, for instance, that gere still looks so damn good, given that he slept through the entire six months it took to make this piece of cra*p. the fact that gere's accent is not only southern irish, but an appalling parody of southern irish shows that the filmmakers weren't looking much beyond america to make money from this film. then there is that lovely scene at the end where sidney poitier (a complete waste of space in this film) says he's off for a coffee, offers to get our "cuddly" ira man one, then casually says "ah, but then you guys drink guinness don't you". yeah that's right sidney; the irish live on guinness and potatoes.while we're on the subject of poitier: why? in the original film the detective is the tracker. in jackal, gere is the tracker. so what does poitier do? well, he just hangs around and looks like a tw*at of course. he's got absolutely nothing to do apart from call in the marines at the end, and he only does this because the nice ira man tells him to.while we're on the subject of gere: why? i suppose it's only a matter of time before hollywood remakes gandhi with vin diesel playing ex-mujahideen commando mahatma gandhi beheading his way through 1940s and 50s india (he is, after all, a bit dark of hue and therefore very likely to be a muslim fundamentalist). let's not forget that gere's character is a killer and therefore a nasty piece of work. and if he's not, why does he know the jackal? if he's not, why does he know all his moves? and if he is, why is he such a limp biscuit and such a "loveable" person? all this goes to show that the makers of this film couldn't be bothered to (a) think about the plot (b) have the characters making decisions that were in keeping with their character(c) avoid cheesy stereotypes like having the big boss bad guy kill his own friend  i honestly thought this had turned into a bond movie (d) give the "central" characters something to do (e) credit the audience with a modicum of intelligence.this film is an insult to the british and irish killed at the hands of terrorists, it's an insult to the irish people, it's an insult to not great, but pretty good film it rips off, and an insult to the intelligence. but most of all  and most unforgivable  it is an insult to my a*rse for having to sit through the over two hours of run time it took to finish. honestly, you'd think with no plot, no characters and no dialogue, it would be over in no time. but they didn't even have the decency to quit early.

heaven, mary and all the saints above! a young man has got super sperm, it's miracle bejesus, call the pope, all you ladies out their desperate to get preggers, line up out side his door and drop your marks and sparks finest! risible retro ealing comedy type comedy, trying to bring you a bit of the auld irish charm. has an effect like placing two fingers down your own throat, voamitus maximus! one out of ten!

the most fertile man in ireland revolves around eamon manley who is 24 year old and still happens to be a virgin. he lives with his mother in belfast. he is also a very shy guy towards women. everything has changes for eamon when he is seduced by a woman(as far as i can remember a neighbour). it is not because he looses his virginity but he discovers that he has a super power. despite having protection, this neighbour becomes pregnant. he is told by the doctor that he has very high sperm count. his mother brilliantly comes up with an idea which makes us see ginger headed babies all around in the end of the film. he starts helping out women in both side of belfast to conceive babies. first voluntarily then with the help of his colleague runs a business out of it. the most fertile man in ireland has its funny moments but needed to come up with better jokes and with a better script. i couldn't help thinking that it gave me the impression of a tv sitcom rather than a movie. kris marshall is a different name on the silver screen but does not shine as star. it's more like the guy you saw in such and such movie. like him being in love actually(i think he was very funny in that one)..well, it was okay to watch but couldn't help dozing off from time to time. ** out of *****

a movie theater with a bad history of past gruesome murders reopens. of course, the bloody killings start anew. written, directed, shot, scored and edited with an appalling lack of flair and finesse by the singularly talentless rick sloane (who later disgraced celluloid some more with the absolutely atrocious "hobgoblins"), this horrendously ham-fisted attempt at a slasher spoof strikes out something rotten in every conceivable way: the excruciatingly lethargic pacing, the painfully static, grainy cinematography (there's a stinky surplus of drab master shots featured throughout), an annoyingly droning and redundant hum'n'shiver synthesizer score, the flat (non)direction, a tediously talky and uneventful script, the groan-inducing sophomoric sense of lowbrow humor, the bloodless murder set pieces, a pitifully unscary killer (he's just some wrinkled-up old guy in pasty make-up), the uniformly obnoxious and unappealing characters, a dissatisfyingly abrupt ending, and lifeless performances from a noticeably uninspired cast all ensure that watching this schlocky swill is about as fun and rewarding as eating rancid raw eels drenched with sour vinegar. this crud totally lacks the necessary crude charm and sleazy vigor required to be enjoyable junk. instead it's just a bland, plodding and meandering stiff that never catches fire or becomes even remotely amusing in a so-shoddy-it's-smoking sort of way. only a smidgen of nudity and the delightful presence of the always dependable mary woronov as a snarky, sardonic secretary provide a little relief from the overall crumminess of this lousy loser.

this movie was so dumb and slow was it ever slow. the only good part of the film was the girl in the tight shinny gold pants. there was no gore whatsover and what is a 80's horror movie without a little gore. plus the killer wasn't at all scary nor were the murders. but if you like to watch the world's worst horror movie then this is for you. don't waste your time like i did watching this.

the most hardcore bad film buff will be surprised by the overall ineptness of this grade-z "film". mary woronov, a clever actress best known for her roles as mary bland in eating raoul and miss togar in rock 'n' roll high school, is by far the best thing about this tripe. this film is almost too bad even for mst3k - honestly!

i agree that mary woronov (murdoch's secretary) is one of the only good things about this film. she is my favorite actress ever, every role she plays is always done so well. her character is sly, sarcastic, clever, light hearted, funny and cunning. she really pulls this role off well and you get a good feel for what her character is all about. the rest of the movie is pretty bad. the music is the most entertaining thing left. one of the characters has this really strange circular radio that she brings with her while she wears her tight zebra striped tank top.one thing that was a little intriguing about the story was the idea that someone hires these three college-aged kids to spruce up an old abandoned theater. he gives them the keys and says - go at it. that would be really fun and i wish someone would give me that chance! imagine going into an old abandoned theater with two other people and you get to decide how to decorate it, and fix it up. you have total control over the whole building. that would be so fun! unfortunately, the characters do not think of this as an exciting adventure, they think of it as a big chore. they walk around with long faces and fight with each other the whole time. it's kind of a bummer. but it's fun to think about the possibilities that these people aren't even excited about.the movie does a pretty good job at making you feel helpless or a little spooked out by the theater itself. however, the acting (besides woronov.. and possibly murdoch, the boss - just because makes a really good money hungry fake smiley business man who never has any luck) is really horrible and you just end up feeling unsatisfied. plus, the random slapstick is a little tacky and kind of ruins the reality that the film tries to create.watch this if you dig mary woronov, funky 80's casio keyboard style electronic beats and if you think having a giant spooky abandoned theater to yourself is at all intriguing.

three young movie theater employees are given the task of re-opening a long closed old-time theater at which many years before a shocking series of grisly murders took place. it seems many more murders have occurred since then but all of this remains unknown to these three young upstart employees hoping to finally make it big on their own. as they approach the grand re-opening night, things keep getting stranger and more unsettling with items suddenly starting to move around by themselves without any seen aid and a terrifying old man seemingly haunting the premises.oh, this is truly horrible. in fact, if it wasn't for mary woronov's secretary character being such a fiercely independent outspoken empowered young woman who steals practically every scene in which she appears and the incredibly hot chick who played the unbelievably sleazy yet totally sexy selina, this would be a total loss. the only other good thing i have to say about this film is some of the movie theater murders are done in truly inventive, albeit not overly gory (a preference for me but not necessarily for others), fashion. the rest just wallows in constant sleaze (so extreme the rare few may actually find humor in it) and runs through the predictable slasher kills annoying characters off one after the other routine.

to truly appreciate this film you had to be there (acting?) or have been a crew member.yes, i am "selena", and at the ripe old age of 42, have serious doubts about what we were doing/did.it all started out to be like a "john waters" type thing, friends acting badly in bad films. somewhere along the line,the fun discontinued, people who were supposed to be friends didn't speak anymore, and bad became worse.i regret the bad image i might have projected.(try to fit in size one gold spandex pants,)other than that, the film sucks so badly, i would not even make my mama watch it.to my director, cast and crew i say,"why can't we just all get along??it's been over twenty years, people!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

last fall (of 2001), i took a film class that was taught by the director of this movie (mark hoeger). his vast knowledge of filmmaking, his ability to dissect any scene of a film, and his winning of an academy award in some obscure category seemed to give him more credibility than your average independent film director. when he mentioned during one of his classes that he had just finished directing a film called "full ride" and was in the post-production stages, my interest was piqued. however, that would be the last i would ever hear of that film project. until last week...last week, i saw in a tv listing that "full ride" was going to be showing on the wb network. this immediately raised a red flag, as i can't help but associate wb with teensploitation shows such as dawson's creek, charmed, etc. plus, the fact that full ride was going to be released straight to tv wasn't too flattering in itself. but, nevertheless, i set aside that time and sat down to watch my former film teacher's creation.after two hours passed and the end credits began to roll, i thought long and hard about what i had just seen. what i had just seen was a typical wb-quality show stretched out to the length of two hours. in fact, it almost seemed as if this movie was made with the sole intent of only showing on the wb network. critiquing this movie will basically be like critiquing a typical wb show.where to begin? the characters are shallow, the story is cliche in every sense of the word, the scenes are completely contrived, and the character development is forced and unbelievable. this movie just screams `unoriginal.'the main character, matt sabo, is some hot shot from the wrong side of the tracks (literally) who plays solid high school football as a fullback, but then fizzles off into a life of crime. he is then offered a chance at a full ride scholarship instead of going to jail. obviously, without much of a choice, he agrees to play football with an all-star football team, but is not excepted among his peers because of his poor team spirit and bad attitude.then comes the love interest. of course! where would this predictable fanfare be without a love interest? she comes in the form of amy lear (played by the beautiful meredith monroe). she is actually a likable character, as opposed to the ever-so-abrasive matt sabo, so we almost applaud her when she rejects him at first. but, of course, the inevitable comes to pass. she falls for him, changes his attitude towards everything, and all seems good and happy. but now it's time for conflict!earlier in the movie, amy makes it clear to matt that she doesn't want to score with him, because it would be `shameful' to her and her mother. this is much to matt's dismay, and his football buddies (yes, they eventually warm up to him) who bet him he wouldn't get any. but, of course, matt eventually comes to accept these terms and decides he's not all about the nookie. here's where the exciting plot thickens. if you don't want me to ruin this surprise, then skip ahead.[begin spoiler]matt finds out from some local guys that apparently amy lear always tries to score with a guy each year from the all-star team so that she can try to use him to escape her small town life of working in a cafeteria (which is baffling in the first place) and make it to the big city. suddenly realizing he's been used and that his love was a sham, matt it tempted to turn back to a life of crime and leave the football camp before `the big game.' amy tries to reassure him that she was really in love this time, but he's too hot-headed to buy it. so what will matt do? will he take her back? or will he go back to robbing gas stations and being an all-round jerk? i won't ruin the super-ultra-surprising ending for you.[end spoiler]so, if i somehow got you pumped up for this movie, please realize that that was my sarcasm and not genuine enthusiasm. this movie is an uninspired version of `varsity blues' or `summer catch.' and that's not saying much. there's hardly any comedy to save it and the characters are too shallow to care about. so what do you have left? not a whole lot.what i most disliked about the movie was how much of an unflattering picture hoeger painted of nebraska through this film. it seems like he was trying to capture the essence of rural nebraska and teenage life in the small towns, but his approach is all too stereotypical and shallow. the characters' high hopes for making in `the big city' and the actions they take to do so are greatly exaggerated, and it only further cements the stereotype of nebraskans being a bunch of hicks living in farm communities. i am unsure of whether or not hoeger's intentions were good in trying to put his home state in the spotlight, but i think he ended up with a very shameful product. if hoeger wanted to portray nebraska in a favorable light, he should have taken a note or two from alexander payne. while payne simply chooses to use nebraska as a backdrop for his films, hoeger integrates it into the plot of full ride and becomes so entangled in his awareness of where he's shooting, that he ends up churning out superficial garbage that would seem to come from an outsider. if hoeger actually lived here, you'd think he'd know better than that.all in all, i am completely disappointed in hoeger's first big film, and i hope that next time he can combine his knowledge with a little bit of originality to create something different and thought-provoking.

read the book, forget the movie!

voor een verloren soldaat , for a lost soldier, is a sad example of how not to translate to film a touching, complex psychological study, of that most magical time in a man's life, when he is still a child, but starting to become a man. the novel records the real life experiences of rudy van dantzig, as told thru the boy jeroen, during the waning days of wwii at age 11 as he deals with his incipient sexuality, and his deep fears of abandonment as he has been sent to the province of friesland, north of holland by his parents because of the lack of food in amsterdam and has not heard from them in many months as the postal service has broken down.. the arrival of the liberating soldiers in the film, is presented in a painfully corny way, with the soldiers providing entertainment vaudeville style. then one soldier, walt, romances jeroen and the pair is presented as two frolicking males.who consummate their love in a sexual experience. this taken in stride by the 11 yo jeroen. the reality was somewhat different: jeroen describes his encounters with walt, 6 in all, in detail but in oblique language. but there is no misunderstanding their nature. walt is aroused to an intense passion by jeroen, during which he handles him roughly, so that in their final meeting, jeroen is bruised and suffering a painful wound on the shoulder where walt has bitten him. during this encounter, walt rapes jeroen, twice. jeroen could have easily avoided walt after their 2nd encounter, when walt first assaults him as walt is clearly anxious to keep his abuse of the boy from the other soldiers. why jeroen keeps seeking walt out is a mystery of the human heart and not explainable, by me anyway. what the film leaves out is the aftermath: the nightmares, the dejection, the frantic search throughout amsterdam on the chance of finding walt, for jeroen loved walt, and nothing could shake that.

this is a painfully slow story about the last days of 1999 when a strange disease breaks out and... i stopped caring. this is suppose to be about two people who live over or under each other in an apartment complex. there's a leak and a plumber put a hole in the man's floor so you can see into the woman's below apartment. also since there is a crisis going on much of the dialog is actually news reports...sounds promising?not really.i became distracted and started doing other things which is deadly in a subtitled film. basically i started not watching, which made events seem even more surreal when i did look up.it may work for you, it didn't for me.

i've had never been disappointed by a kurosawa film, but this is probably the first. "doppelganger" is the worst i've seen from this director.tartan films is advertising this as "the most frightening film yet from kiyoshi kurosawa". what? the most frightening film from kurosawa is definitely "kairo". and if you think this is horror, your in for a surprise. this can't be classified as horror, or thriller. this is a drama, and a pretty bad one at that. a lot of scenes that were meant to be shocking have turned out being funny, and a lot of the plot is really confusing. and since it's kurosawa, the pacing is slow. but it's so slow that you'll lose interest forty minutes in, and feel like doing something else. the thing that annoyed me the most was the use of cgi. now cgi, if used well, can be really cool. but if executed with little care... it can be a disaster. i think that describes one scene here that has a very minimal use of cgi.the only positive thing i can give "dopppelganger" is that it has really good acting. koji yakusho gives a great performance, along with the rest of the cast. but that's pretty much it...please, do yourself a favor, and go watch "kairo" or "ko-rei" if you want to be scared. this is a bad, bad attempt at a smart drama. which it is intelligent, but... well, there's a lot missing.3/10 for the good acting.

would someone explain to me when the ghoulies learned to speak? this was a horrible film, i loved "ghoulies" and "ghoulies 2", but what's this? unless you want to kill yourself, please stay away from "ghoulies 3". on a scale of 1 to 10, "ghoulies 3" gets a 1!!

this rubber monsters failed trying to be cool,scary or even comedians,looks like a wannabe movie of porkys or animals house but the sequences and history is not always clear also can't catch your attention all the movie looks cheap and with an amazing bad taste,the only thing that's makes you laugh is the awful rubber monsters who must have a cost of one dollar each,because the work or them never looks realistic,the movements and expressions make looks the muppets as a pixar 3d movie when you compare with this. hope marie carlton is the only thing that makes supportable this awful movie,and when she dies in the movie,this turns even worst than before.a movie who only must be seen in fast forward.

lame is really the best way to describe this movie. it has a real poor script, uninteresting dialog and characters and it's lacking in basically everything else as well. there are too many characters and problem is that you don't care about any of them. what the movie is lacking is one good and clear main character. instead now the movie has a bit of everything, it has a bit of an hero, it has a bit of a love interest and it has a bit of villain. i wish it only had a bit less ghoulies though, fore they are just mostly very annoying in this movie.ghoulies are supposed to be devilish creatures, who murder for pleasure. in this movie however all they want to do is drink beer and watch naked college girls. besides, someone had the 'brilliant' idea to let the ghoulies be able to talk this time. this works out really poorly and annoying. the ghoulie-puppets had been definitely upgraded for this movie and they are more detailed looking and are able to do more, however at the same time they are way more fake looking than the ones from the previous ghoulies movies.it's obvious that the aim for this movie was more comedy than horror this time. the movie is like a lame '80's high-school comedy (even though this movie got released in 1991). it's humor is really the worst and most lame thing about the entire movie. it's so incredibly annoying and simply not funny at all.the story is not going anywhere with its story and the movie is just basically one big mess, that never seems to end. the ghoulies plot line seems basically to have nothing to do at all with the other plot lines of the movie, involving the human characters. the movie is not at all about the ghoulies terrorizing a college, with the humans trying to hunt them down and stop their rampage. no big surprise that this is brent olson's only written movie as of yet. he simply has no talent for it and i think that he has discovered this as well and has gone back to college himself instead.even when compared to the previous ghoulies movies; this movie is just simply terrible!2/10

i don't really know why but i watched this with quite a sense of anticipation. unfortunatly it was misplaced. firstly this is not horror, it doesn't scare and (unless it was even worse than i gave it credit for - which is possible) doesn't try to. it's a trashy comedy and the fact i smiled once means i gave it a 2 not a 1. this film ripps of gremlins in a truly special way, i can't claim to have ever seen a film which devotes its self more. very, very bad - avoid.

maybe it is unfair for me to review this movie because i walked out well before the end. that's odd, because i usually like shakespeare on the screen and i enjoyed midsummers night's dream once, many years ago, when i saw it on the stage. i think that two things did me in: that squeaky twerp with the shakespearian name, calista flockhart, and michelle feiffer sitting in a giant clamshell. well, i suppose you could say it supposed to be a comedy -- but when the scenery is funny and the actors aren't, i'd say we have a bad movie on our hands....

i have been watching "lost" with my family since the first episode, it used to be great. the last season it was very disappointing, it seems as if they (writers)don't know what to do with the show, so, they keep trying to make it up for it by stretching one story line in a whole episode. the present season, which by the way i decided to keep watching only to see rodrigo santoro, and also with a tiny little hope that things would get better; has been one disappointment after another; my husband and son even stopped watching. first of all, he (santoro) only appears for 30 seconds in each episode. but the real problem is with the story line, there is nothing really happening, each episode could be shown in 15 minutes. we watch each episode waiting for something that never happens; i am not asking that every secret be revealed at once, but how about some variation in the story lines? in the first and second seasons, we had different story lines, we saw the characters history, a little action, a little romance, now is like one big event that takes the whole episode to unveil. it is almost tiring to watch it, when it finishes you have a feeling that you lost your time. now, it is important to note that the actors still great.i can't believe they killed mr. eko(adelawale...)he was great, jack(mathew fox)is still incredible, the perfect hero, so kind, magnanimous, brave. sawyer(josh holloway), the "bad boy" is kind of mellowing because of kate(evangeline lylli), but that's cool. i miss sayid(naveen andrews), sun and jin(yoon-jin kim & daniel dae kim), they are all an important part of the plot (or should be), but we barely see them. i hope paulo(rodrigo santoro) will have a big part on the show; if not, why did you make such a big deal of him joining the show (access hollywood, etc)? sorry if i've been rumbling for too long, but i feel cheated by this show. when i started watching it was great, i got used to it, and now it is very disappointing to see the way it is going. i'll be here, hoping for the improvements!!! katia

if this movie were in production today it would probably have the christian right-wingers screaming 'child porn'. it is far from a great film, in fact it is rather pedestrian. however, if you have an imagination and a fond remembrance of youth and first love i recommend it.

i've enjoyed watching lost from the beginning and endured a few bad actors in poorly written episodes because when lost is good, it's really good! but this episode that features mr echos demise had so many drawn out scenes with lingering closeups of bad acting that i found myself tapping the fast forward button. this episode stood out so far as by far the worst. in fact, the variation in quality of lost has been so inconsistent, i find myself often wondering how many writers they are using.i will continue to watch but hope things get better and hope i stop secretly wishing for the sub-par actors in the series to die off.

was unlucky enough to see this while travelling by coach across africa. it was far and away the worst film i have ever come across. deserves to be the #1 all-time worst ;-) no acting, no plot, very little speaking. lots of ape-like grunting though, in this hopelessly unlikely film. an unwitting self-satire - you'll either laugh at it or cry.

i remember seeing this film when i was about 10, one of my friends had it. at the time it was just a film as i was about 10ish and just thought of it as another action film.when i look back now as a complete film buff this is quite a shockingly bad film. whoever produced this film i am sure had a short hollywood career. although the lead actor seems to have done a few films according to imdb, albeit i haven't seen any and don't really remember him too much.anyway, just to say that this film is really bad, in all ways it could be. i would love to see it again though :od

i would be one of the few people who owns a copy of this classic. but i dont only own 1, i actually own 2. its that good.well, when i say good, i mean bad. but i will try to do a thorough review. i even watched 'born a ninja' which one of the other reviewers here mentioned, to compare it to this. and born a ninja is actually worse, but not quite as funny.and is this ever funny. everything about this movie is poor. everything. the plot is absolutely stuffed (note the 'you'll need to keep me alive if you want to know where to find your wife'). every action sequence is stuffed too. our hero danton is more than a hero; he can stab people with twigs, take 3 bullets in the heart at 50 cm away without even bleeding, and tie a rope up to a tree which, when an enemy steps on it, ties a knot around the enemies leg, picks him up, and throws him 50 metres into a bunch of spikes.the acting is so bad it is impossible to comment on it, but it should have you rolling, especially dantons 'jump out of the ground and growl at the bad guy'. oh yes, and the bad guys: somehow, it seems they resurrect themselves 5 times each in the movie. perhaps it's just that there weren't enough actors, but in a movie of this calibre? i doubt that.the 'plot' is about how danton was a soldier in the vietnam war, and now his colonel is hunting real people for training for his mercenaries. the colonel just happens to pick up danton, then danton fights back. this is just the excuse for a rambo clone, with most of the movie being danton slaughtering soldiers. and i really cant explain the plot any more cos there is nothing else to the movie. it still rocks though.what else could be wrong you ask? dont get me started. hand grenades which actually go off at the actors' feet because the explosion is the size of a match.scenes where there are 5 people chasing danton, then the camera cuts away and back and there are 7. the way that every time danton loads the grenade launcher he is against the same background even though he is in completely diffrent locations. and the worst part is when danton pushes the plastic boulders onto the enemies, and one enemy is completely untouched by the boulders, so he doesn't know what to do so he half heartedly dies without even being touched. it's ridiculous!!!but funny. very, very funny. this is one of the few movies i can thoroughly recommend to everybody, cos if you dont find it funny, you are 1 in a million. and for the rest of us it's magic.

i've got as much testosterone as the next bloke, and raquel welch at her finest is certainly worth a look; but the fact is that a cardboard cut-out could act better, and an hour and half of ms. w showing off her considerable assets does not a movie make.considering the cast, it's surprising that it's as bad as it is. i've never been a big fan of wagner, and his tough guy harry is about as convincing as a 9-dollar bill. godfrey cambridge and vittorio de sica, both of whom i usually enjoy, seem to be sleeping through their lines; and as for edward g...well, i can only assume he was there for the paycheck.this film is a mess: from non-existent plot, through stop-start action and unfunny script to puerile slapstick and annoying 60's 'caper' music. if it weren't for miss welch, i'd have given it a 0.that said, she is a treat to the eyes - even better than her delicious cameo in 'bedazzled' - and for that reason alone i gave it a 3.

following his role in the fine caper seven thieves (1960) – which i’ve watched several years back – edward g. robinson seemed to be stuck playing elderly criminal mastermind types (apart from the odd juicy role as in the cincinnati kid [1965]). i’d previously watched the pretty good “euro-cult” effort grand slam (1967) and, apart from this, i’ve yet two more similar titles from italy to check – one of which was directed by future goremeister lucio fulci! anyway, this is the kind of international production – featuring american and italian actors and a british director – which was prevalent during the 1960s; it’s harmless and easy-going in itself but hardly memorable and definitely overlong – especially since to procure finance for the heavy-duty equipment required for the heist (such as an army tank and an airplane!), the gang involved have to pull a variety of minor thefts first.the gang, of course, is an incompetent lot led by an american (robert wagner) and his bimbo girlfriend (raquel welch) – the others are a ‘pacifist’ black man, a perennially hungry italian and a diminutive englishman. they try to induce an ex-gangster (vittorio de sica) to turn over his fortune to them, except he’s destitute…but, under the auspices of “professor” robinson, he proposes instead a caper of 5 million dollars’ worth of platinum! needless to say, the gang members don’t trust one another (wagner instructs welch to seduce de sica so as to get the name of their fence in morocco – where they are to retreat after the robbery), or else bungle the job (commissioned to hold up a restaurant, the italian can’t resist sitting at table and order a multi-course meal for himself!). amusingly, in the face of similar failures, de sica tries to show them how they used to do it in the old days – however, ostensibly holding up a petrol station, it transpires that the owner is a nephew of his and he merely asked to borrow some cash! the central heist sequence is typically elaborate: while the gang, including welch, ‘take’ the train transporting the platinum, wagner kidnaps pilot victor spinetti and his airplane. when the job is done, he fully intends to double-cross de sica – but neither his partners nor welch herself are willing to go along with this, so he’s forced to relent. coming from the time when crime didn’t pay, the gang contrives to lose all their stash in mid-air when the plane’s bomb-bay doors are accidentally opened…

this movie is a cinematic collage of gangster clichés. the writing is grade z and the plot and story are constructed without care or logic. it a messy pastiche of stereotypical gangsters (think of bugs bunny cartoons) and silly supporting characters (the lady doctor and the writer). there are much better bogart films out there. in fact, bogart looks like he slept through this performance. he puts very little effort into this character. i think the directorial advice he received was something like "he's a bad guy. act bad". this guy is the era's equivalent of darth vader; obvious, evil and the anti-hero. don't waste your time with this one.

although humphrey bogart got star billing in king of the underworld, i'm willing to bet he didn't thank jack warner for it. in fact this film was one hollow crown.king of the underworld was supposedly a remake of the paul muni film, dr. socrates, but given humphrey bogart was in the cast, the character is written more like duke mantee in the petrified forest. he even has an english writer along in the person of james stephenson.kay francis and john eldredge are a pair of married doctors and eldredge pulls off a tricky bit of surgery on one of bogart's henchmen. bogey's a man who appreciates good work done on his behalf and gives eldredge $500.00 and there's more where that came from if he plays his cards right. eldredge who has a gambling problem sees a good way to get some undeclared income. but when he's killed in a raid on the gang's hideout, francis is also thought to be involved by the law and the american medical association no matter how much she protests her innocence. it's no good and she and her aunt jessie busley move to a small town to get away from the notoriety.of course the notoriety and bogart and an itinerant leslie howard like writer in stephenson all meet up with her again. but kay is plucky and resourceful to say the least.bogart's character was ridiculous, no wonder the poor guy was screaming for better parts. he's a gangster who both shoots down people without mercy and gives his henchmen hotfoots just for laughs. he's concerned about his image and therefore kidnaps writer stephenson to ghost write his autobiography and of course confesses enough to burn him in all 48 states. and then let's kay francis completely outsmart him, hard to believe he was king of anything.definitely one of the lesser works for either of the stars.

this was the worst wrestlemania in history. the only good matches were ricky steamboat vs. hercules hernandez, and the tag title match between the british bulldogs and the dream team (this one bordered on classic). everything else was either poor or awful. the idea of having three host cities was unnecessary, confusing and messed up the fluidity of the show. the celebrity guests were terrible on commentary, especially susan saint james.if you're interested in the mid 80's wwf, you're better renting or buying wrestlemania 3, or just about any other ppv for that matter.

*possible spoilers ahead*i'll only say what hasn't already been said here (and i'll continue this for the rest of my wwf/wwe comments).if you're going to have a women's title match, at least make it interesting, rather than just a squash to put over the current champion. i guess moolah couldn't handle an intense match but they wanted to have the legend in a wrestlemania.i thought the killer bees were wasted in wrestlemanias, especially here. i became a fan in 1989, about a year after the b. brian blair was gone and jim brunzell became a canvas back. so i didn't realize for a while that they were a top tag team, even top contenders.but i loved seeing bill fralic in the battle royal. he really came into his own here, creating a cocky heel character in a pre-match interview and even making an elimination in the battle royal. besides steve mcmichael and kevin greene, he is the only professional athlete from my generation with any respect for wrestling (anyone remember dennis rodman?). and what was with the hart foundation's ridiculous green tights?

wrestlemania 2 is the only wrestlemania|thank god| to be held at three different locations, and while it was an interesting idea, it didn't really work. there are only really two matches that really struck out, with the rest being decent, or most of them, pretty terrible. there are some entertaining celebrity's on hand, like susan saint james, ray charles and cathy crosby, but the experience was a waste of time for the most part. the british bulldgos vs the dream team match, is worth the price of admission itself, but you can honestly see that anywhere.matches.nassau coliseum.paul orndorff vs the magnificent muraco/w mr.fuji. for the time it had, and despite the crappy finish, this was surprisingly bearable stuff, with the crowd being really into it. crowd chants "bullsh*t" at the end. that being said it did nothing for either's career. match ends in a double count out with them fighting outside the ring2/5intercontinental championship match. randy savage|c| vs george "the animal" steele. not that great wrestling wise, but heavily entertaining due to the antics involved, and some great comedy from steele, besides savage can wrestle a potato and make it look interesting. savage wins when he puts his feet on the ropes, for leverage.2 1/2 /5jake "the snake" roberts vs george wells. for a throwaway match, this was better than it should have been, but it's too short to make any impact what so ever. roberts wins with the ddt, pulling out the snake afterwords, which disgusts saint james.1 1/2 /5boxing match. mr.t/w the hati kid&joe frazier vs roddy piper/w lou duva&bob orton. a huge failure in my opinion. i was bored senseless throughout this, and while it may have been a marketing success, it certainly didn't succeed at entertaining me. lot of rowdy chants are noticeable as well. t wins by dq, when piper slams t.1/5rosemont horizonwomen's title match. fabulous moolah|c| vs velvet mcintyre. ends too quickly, before it even gets a chance to start, making a record for quick pin fall, as far as woman's matches are concerned. moolah wins when she takes advantage of velvet's missed splash from the top rope0/5corporal kirchner vs nikolai volkoff/w classy freddie blassie. big pop for the corporal. stupid match up, with boring offense from both involved, while being much too short to matter. corporal wins when he whacks volkoff with blassie's cane.1/5battle royal. william perry and andre get the biggest pops. this is pretty entertaining stuff, despite all the nfl talent involved. it's also noteworthy for bret hart's 1st ever wrestlemania appearance. andre wins when he chucks the hart foundation out.2 1/2 /5tag team titles. british bulldogs/w lou albano&ozzy osbourne vs the dream team/w johnny valiant|c|. absolutely tremendous match, that is one of the best wrestlemania matches of all time. you won't have time to catch your breath, with all the maneuvers on hand, and the excellent in ring psychology. this is pure wrestling at it's finest, you cannot call yourself a wrestling fan, if you dislike this match. bulldogs win when dynamite kid collide's heads with valentine4/5los angeles memorial sports arenaricky steamboat vs hercules hernandez. pretty decent match up here, with both men putting on solid performances. hercules is a nasty brute, with above average skills, and it contrasted well with steamboat's high-flying style. steamboat wins with a high-flying cross body off the top rope.2 1/2 /5adrian adonis vs uncle elmer. terrible match, with annoying comedy involved. the fans love uncle elmer, but i do not. adonis wins with a top rope maneuver.0/5the funk brothers vs tito santana&jyd. pretty solid match here, with a lot of memorable bumps taken from terry funk|the one through the table was something else for that time|. i would have to rate this as my 2nd favorite. funks win with help from jimmy hart's megaphone.3/5wwf championship. hulk hogan|c| vs king kong bundy. decent pop for hogan. one of the most over-hyped matches in wrestlemania history. hogan can't wrestle worth a lick, and bundy is not that great himself. the violence was brutal for the time, but hogan's superhero act is kind of annoying, and there are too many boring moments. hogan wins when he escapes before bundy.1/5bottom line. wrestlemania 2 is a failure in most aspects. die hard wrestling fans should see this once, but you really don't have too. there isn't enough here, to satisfy a true wrestling fan. vince blew it on this one. don't be fooled by the hype of the main event, it really is a boring affair, like most of the card. not recommended, and ranks as one of the worst wrestlemania's, outside of the brilliant tag title match.4/10

why do the powers that be continue to cast jennifer lopez in unbelievable roles? she was excellent in selena, and pretty good in money train, which both cast her in roles where she could basically be herself. however, roles like this just draw the line. i could never see lopez as an fbi agent (see out of sight for that unremarkable performance), but as a psychotherapist? give me a break!basically, lopez plays the aforementioned psychotherapist, who is involved in virtual reality experiments in which she enters the minds of her patients in order to help them sort out their issues. when she enters the mind of a comatose serial killer to help save one of his victims, she breaks all the rules to try and crack the insanity of his inner mind.lopez's acting here is typically below average. i can't get over that high-pitched squeak of a voice she has. she's no julia roberts, but yet she comes across on screen as though she believes herself to be on the same playing field. well, she's not even in the same stadium. sure, she is a very sexy lady; however, that isn't going to carry a film, and it certainly doesn't carry this one. with anybody else cast in her role for this film it would have been excellent, especially if it was cast with someone who could lend more credibility to the character.having said all that, this film is visually stunning. the colors are fabulous, and the story line isn't half bad in a b-movie kind of way. the audio here is superb as well. this movie gains some points for the fairly original storyline, and major points for how it looks and sounds. unfortunately, the acting and poor casting bring it down a few notches.my rating: 6/10

i love exotic science fiction/fantasy movies but this one was very unpleasant to watch. suggestions and images of child abuse, mutilated bodies (live or dead), other gruesome scenes, plot holes, boring acting made this a regretable experience, the basic idea of entering another person's mind is not even new to the movies or tv (an outer limits episode was better at exploring this idea). i gave it 4/10 since some special effects were nice.

if you like to watch movies because they are pretty, you should be okay with this one. if you like to watch movies that start out with a good guy trying to catch a bad guy, then reveal clues to the motives of each throughout the movie, skip it. at the end of the movie i still didn't know why stargher killed the women the way he did. when you set up such a ritualistic serial killer it would be nice to know where the rituals originated from. in dreams was a similar pretty movie with a serial killer which also wasn't the best, but at least the whys of how he killed the girls was explained. they also hinted at a dark background for vaughn's character but didn't explain, didn't really say why lopez's child psychologist was so much better suited for this task than the rest of the people they interviewed, didn't give much of an explanation for the little kid's problem, etc. if the rest of the story is compelling, i don't care about details like how stargher afforded all the fancy electronic equipment and underground chambers or why the fbi wasn't checking to see if he owned any other property or had access to out of the way places while they were waiting to see if the whole entering the killer's mind thing would work, but i do like to have a sense of what motivates the serial killer in a serial killer movie when he kills in such a complex manner.

as i said the idea itself was great and it had plenty potential. i was truly sad of discovering that this was another typical american mass movie: "we are in this for the money..." if only the producers had had more time to actually make the movie. this one was not finished when they let it out...

i really enjoy this genre but the cell was one of the worst movies i've ever been unfortunate enough to watch. while about 25 percent of my audience wandered in and out of the theater during the viewing (or left entirely) i was dumb enough to stick it out. the main problems with this story (there were too many to list all) is that with this type of film you have to do two things... one, provide fear of the killer (being that they catch him twenty minutes into the film that's gone) and you must give the victim whose life is at stake (the girl in the tank) enough character development that you actually care whether they get to her in time or not. not only did i lose track of the girl, i was given such little insight into her that she was only a blurry face and when i did remember she was part of the story i really didn't care what happened to her. while the visuals were interesting in an lsd flashback sort of way, they often times made no sense and this should be a lesson that visuals can't make up for lack of a good story (see phantom menace for another example) finally, does anyone know or care what was up with the women kneeling in that field and staring at the sky? ridiculous.

i'm in a film class and i know that i don't know everything about film but truthfully this is one of the worst, stupidest, retarded and waste time, movies that i have ever seen and i saw napolean dinamite. they are both equally terrible. conrack is boring and nothing interesting even happens in the film its not really a heart warming story and pat conroy overcomes nothing! i'm not saying there should be fighting and crap blowing up but it would liven up this more than bland film. the kids they fond to act in this film may have been the real kids from yammacraux island they sounded stupid and couldn't act as as far as i am concerned this was a stupid idea for a book and an even worse idea for a movie i don't know why this movie was even made, deviantly top five worst movies of all time.

not the best of the lone star series, but it moves along quickly with good performances. introduced as "singin' sandy" in the main title, john wayne as a 'singing cowboy' isn't successful-- you never even see a front close-up of him while he's 'singing.' the actual singer is the director's son, bill bradley, who warbles away sounding like many popular singers of the day such as hutch or joseph wagstaff. the film features: cecilia parker (also seen in "the lost jungle" serial, "tombstone canyon," and as older sister marian in the andy hardy movies) doing her best katherine hepburn-- "really they mustn't; really i'm not"; al st. john, before he literally became "fuzzy" filling all his available screen time with his characteristic business of hat flipping, head and chin scratching, grimacing, and gawky physical gestures and movements; george (pre-gabby) hayes as a gentle pipe smoking father; and forrest taylor, minor vet of 395 movies and tv shows, playing the oily villain with string bow tie and prop cigar. fun or odd moments: yakima canutt's great 'under the stagecoach' trick; the 'gay' scene when singin' sandy ties bert and elmer together face to face, drags them roped to his horse, and dumps them at kincaid's office, where kincaid says, "you're a fine pair of lovebirds!"; denton's rapturous comment after an atrocious song and guitar playing performance by 'sandy,' -- "ummm. i could listen to that all night!"; kincaid's reply, we won't go into that," after being told by a rancher "you've got the soul of a snake!"; and, of course, he utters the immortal, "i've made denton an offer he can't refuse." the plot of the movie is saved by sandy's tricking kincaid, and later saying the three magic words in many of these films: "i'm from washington." fdr has saved us from the depression! (is that why the villains are always either bankers or in real estate?) the shootout sequence is taken from the earlier bradbury film "man from hell's edges" (1932). all of the lone star westerns are special because of their unique mixture of interesting characters, the troupe of actors and stunt people, and the spin on the clichés and repetitive back stories and situations. this one ranks a little low, marred by the inappropriate and mis-used "singing cowboy" gimmick. i'll give it a 4.

"riders of destiny" was the first of several westerns wayne made for the lone star arm of monogram pictures between 1933 and 1935. in this entry, the producers try to make the duke into a singing cowboy called "singin' sandy saunders with hilarious results. any wayne fan knows that the duke couldn't have carried a tune if his life had depended on it. his voice was apparently dubbed by smith ballew whose deep baritone sounds nothing like wayne. wayne looks awkward and uncomfortable in "performing" the musical numbers. thank heavens the singing cowboy experiment soon ended.as for the movie itself, it contains a standard "b" western plot of the fight over water rights between the villain (forrest taylor) and the local ranchers. duke, of course plays the hero. he had not yet developed his on screen character and still looked like a poverty row cowboy.also cast in the film were george (pre-gabby) hayes as the heroine's father, cecilia parker as the heroine and yakima canutt as "one of the boys" who performs his "falling from the racing horses under the wagon" stunt while doubling wayne. both canutt and hayes would go on to appear with wayne in most of the other entries in the series. canutt, in particular would have a profound effect on wayne's future development teaching him, among other things, how to move, fight and look comfortable on a horse.as "b" westerns go this one isn't too bad, however, i have to give it a failing grade because of the "singing".

this is one of the worst films i've ever seen, don't watch it even if your life depends on it.this laurel and hardy film is when they inherit an island, become shipwrecked and are set to be hung. an incredibly boring film that is no where near funny.this was the last laurel and hardy film and what a very low note to end such a superb career. the 40's films weren't great, this film was made in 1950. if you want to remember laurel and hardy, remember them in their prime, the 1930's. the short talking films are better than the feature length films, my favourite is "me and my pal". another reason this film is awful is because it's dubbed. the actor opens there mouth and the words come out three days later. absoulutley crap, but let's end on a high note, laurel and hardy have been, in my opinion, the best double act ever.

i could almost wish this movie had not been made. stan laurel was dying, and it shows in his face, even more angular and gaunt than usual. a poor script, and inept supporting cast.

what a script, what a story, what a mess!

one of the worst films i have ever seen, but extremely funny (not on purpose though). every scene that contains anything to do with; aircraft, romance, script or acting is badly messed up.i recommend this film for all pilots, it´s so bad that you should burst into laughter at some point in the film (also see airport 79:the concorde, for the same reason).anyone else, avoid this film like the plague (except for fans of b-movies, of course)enjoy

although i have rarely flown myself, i am keenly interested in aviation... and this film has added to the precious laughing stock in aviation cinema.1. why is the captain doing the ground checks? why does he even measure the oil levels in the engines? with turnaround times as low as 15 minutes in commercial aviation this is not a typical pre-flight check.2. why does the captain kick against the aircraft tire? strange kind of pressure check. or anger management :-)3. the cockpit has a crew of 3. all large, western, two-engined jets built since the 1980ies have a crew of 2 people. now try a guess at how old the movie script is.4. a helicopter manages to fly alongside the crippled airliner. must be a fast one... and the captain's words to explain the "maneuver" to the passengers are indeed hilarious ones!5. with arrested elevator rudders it is always possible to lower the nose of the aircraft. it happens, for example, when any aircraft moves slower than the stall speed.6. the elevator rudders have hydraulic actuators. after the collision with the business plane it would, most probably, have severed the hydraulic lines and thus make them useless for steering, but it would not fix them in certain position.7. the fire in the aft galley was a stupid idea. it was designed to show that only gentlemen ask for the extinguisher and fight the fire, regardless of who was actually trained to do that  the flight attendant.8. at the time of collision, the aircraft's elevators would have been in a neutral position. the film could have ended here...9. the flight engineer (the third person in the cockpit) has three bars on his uniform. in reality, flight engineers have two.10. why does the captain slash the cabin casing with an axe to examine the damage behind? i thought it would have been the flight engineer's duty, as he is already supposed to perform technical checks before and after flight.11. in any aircraft, there is no unused space. at least commercial airplanes cannot afford the luxury of a compartment that can be filled with tons of water.i could go on and on... but at last i laughed hysterically about how the screenwriters imagine aircraft disasters! woooohooo! most aircraft disasters happen in such a short time span that you simply cannot make 90-minute flicks out of them. but you can always fill 90 minutes with mind-boggling and insane crap, irrespective of the genre.

you've got to watch this movie! it is so bad it actually is great.you've got your crazy but gutsy captain who of course is having an affair with his worn out used to be gorgeous copilot. and of course the mid air collision occurs when the captain's enemy and rivalis along for the ride to geyou've got your ex vietnam vet who is can't handle the pressure of another mid air collision and crash landing. then you've got your old crazy army air corp buddy who is flying the chase plane and trying to well i can't tell you what he's trying to do. the plane keeps going up, up and well and then you've got your greedy and immoral corporate engineer and then you've got your ice station zebra cold and then lucky saves the bad guy from drowing so they can land the plane! and it doesn't end --- it just goes on and on! you've got to watch this. it's great! you've got to be kidding! did they actually show this on commercial television and how it was ever shown on cable.

weak tale of an evil warlock who is searching for a centuries old satanic bible so that he can do lucifer's bidding by undoing creation. hot in pursuit all the way is a 17th centruy bounty hunter named redfern and his reluctant sidekick kassandra. sound like a load of bunkum? it is.this drivel from writer d.t. twohy gets the superficial treatment it deserves from director steve miner (who helmed that romantic nonsense "forever young"). twohy obviously knows nothing about true evil.julian sands just flies around and cackles, trying to look evil, while richard e. grant succeeds only in wasting his rich talent. lori singer's career also took a nosedive with this one.special effects crew has some fun, and jerry goldsmith provides a score superior to its subject matter.

i never want to see this movie again!not only is it dreadfully bad, but i can't stand seeing my hero stan laurel looking so old and sick.mostly i can't stand watching this terrible movie!frankly, there is no reason to watch this awful film. the plot is just plain stupid. the actors that surround stan laurel and oliver hardy are really really bad and laurel and hardy have been funnier in any of their earlier films! i warn you don't watch it, the images will haunt you for a long while to come!

two escaped convicts step out of the woods and shoot two campers in the head. that's the first scene, and it made me wince, fearing what was in store. but by the end of the first half hour i was all swept up in the flood of images. not because i cared in the least about any of the characters but because i was aghast at how execrable the film was and was curious to see how truly low it could sink.frank (remar) and red (woolvett) are the ex-inmates. after murdering the two innocent campers they plow through the woods and wangle their way into the isolated cabin of dean stockwell and his two sons, the attorney keith and the estranged homosexual behr. the escapees at first pretend their car has broken down and they need to use the phone, but they gradually reveal their identities.well, it looks like familiar territory so far. "desperate hours," or "funny games" maybe. but -- hang on -- the gay son is in cahoots with the two. it seems that stockwell, upon discovering his son in flagrante delicto with another man named billy, kicked billy around and threw him out. billy went on to die and behr now blames his dad for the death. and, indeed, dad is something of a neanderthal when it comes to paraphilias, the fact that he was just found cohabiting with a secretary notwithstanding.the grief-stricken behr just searched and searched, looking for someone else who had known billy, someone with whom he could share his despair. it turned out to be one of the escapees, and now behr is determined to see them to their freedom.it gets all twisted after that. people talk. they talk and talk. they talk continually. and not about the two mad killers who just can't wait to put one between their eyes. no -- the dialog goes something like, "you were just so scared of something inside yourself that you even drove away your own son." that's behr, the young gay guy, talking to stockwell. it's as if an afternoon domestic drama had had its genes mixed with a killer thriller in some kind of transformational device or cocktail shaker.the only real performance is given by james remar as the more talkative and ominous of the two escapees. and that's mainly because of his gruff but fluid baritone, which sounds like lance henrickson's, and his wide guppy-like lips. he's easy on the eyes and ears.dean stockwell has given decent performances, including his inestimable bizarro turn in "blue velvet," in which he was my supporting player, but here laziness, advancing years, or slack direction has shaped his every move and every utterance into a stereotype. it's as if he were reading stage directions -- "look surprised" and "shout angrily" -- and following them literally. there's not a surprise in a cartload.if the gay son, jason behr, ever blinked, it must have been while i was blinking at the same time because i missed it. he has a long neck and just one expression in his instrument. woolvett as the secondary villain fades into the pine-knot paneled woodwork. the attorney son is robert glen keith. i hope he didn't quit his day job.the direction is pedestrian, the staging functional without being in the least innovative. sometimes it's confusing. i lost track of where everyone was supposed to be as the killers are circling around on the cabin's porch and the family has locked itself inside with a shotgun. i also couldn't understand how stockwell could put a blast through the cabin's door, hit remar, and knock him in a back flip off the porch, and then remar could simply stand up, dust himself off, and come up with a cranky riposte like, "okay. two can play that game." but why go on? see it if you must.

i am an indian residing in the united states. why india continues, like a dumb animal, to emulate everything american is beyond me!! the main problems with the movie aren't so much the inane plot and dumb comedy. it is that this movie has a lot of sex, touching, women dressing like strumpets in the streets, and a lot of cursing that doesn't belong anywhere on t.v.to the producers and directors of this movie, i have this message: you continue to weaken our nation's strong family values by making this sort of junk. you continue to let young women think it's okay to have a feminist attitude and have no morals. you continue to make dance songs that belong in the lowest of adult clubs and bars. i am ashamed to be an indian after seeing movies like this.in 2003, the united states government suggested that the best way to destroy iran is to 'send miniskirts' there. there is no need to do that for india. we will destroy ourselves with rubbish like this.

oh my god that has got to be one of the most useless brainless stupidest comedy ever made!! what has happened to subhash ghai, even apna sapna money money was worth watchingeww! god this movie stinksdo not watch it save your money bad movie bad cast bad jokes bad acting, even this movie is an example of shoe polish being rubbed on a facetrust me this movie does even make you smile, vulgar jokes, cheap jokes,a really stupid movie with no conceptsrating 0 on 10awful movie those are the two hours im never getting back....syed shabbir aly naqvi of pakistan

if you have plenty of time to kill and the dvd was given to you by your friend for free but still it may require lot of courage to watch this film which does not have good script or humor for that matter.on the acting front imran is frozen in time/acting, tushar kapoor was slightly better than imran in this movie paresh rawal was good at comedy was usual. the story revolves around a college campus where imran is a bad boy n tushar is the good one, they pretend to be the opposite of respective nature and so the story goes on.....watch it only if you don't have any thing to do and the film is running on your local cable tv.

wow. as soon as i saw this movie's cover, i immediately wanted to watch it because it looked so bad. sometimes i watch bollywood movies just because they're so bad that it will be entertaining (eg. koi mil gaya). this movie had all the elements of an atrocious film: a "gang of local thugs" that is completely harmless, a poorly done motorcycle scene, horrible dialouge ("congrats son, i am very proud that you are a bad boy"), actors playing basketball as if they are good, atrocious songs ("me bad, me bad, me bad bad boy"), unexplained plot lines like why are the good boy and bad boy friends??? and why is the hot girl in love with the nerd?? i've never seen such a poorly constructed story with such horrible directly. some of the scenes actually took 30 seconds long like the one where the good and bad boys inexplicably ran over the "gang member's" poker game. congrats ashwini chaudry, you are a bad director. if you want to watch a good movie, watch guru, if you want to watch a movie so bad that it's actually entertaining, then watch good boy, boy.

can u believe a college professor made this film?????the same man who made dhoopthe film is horrible and has some of the weird scenes everthe main message is nice but presented badlythe film looks like a collage of amateurish scenes, miscasts.etc and bad performancesdirection and everything is poormusic is okayemraan's naughty streak works and he does well tusshar is bad tanushree and isha are bad paresh annoys when he looks at the mirror

it's really a shame there was so much controversy surrounding this picture (in other words, the infamous affair between ingrid bergman and roberto rossellini), as this drew a lot of attention to a very forgettable film. the story is incredibly slow, cheap looking and uninteresting. and, to top this off, the film is stuffed to the brim with amateurish actors who can barely speak any english. i really would have preferred subtitles--it would have made the experience less exhausting. back to the rotten acting. the neo-realist movement was big in italy at the time this film was made. many of these films are absolute masterpieces (such as de sica's umberto d., the children are watching us and miracle in milan) because they got so much out of the non-professional actors. they behaved like normal people, but in stromboli they act like normal people trying to be actors and come off very badly--like kids in a school play. by the way,...if you are hoping the movie has a good ending (thereby making your time commitment to the film worth while), don't bother. the plot was just totally uninvolving and silly--so much so, that i really found that i could have cared less about the characters. like the island they all inhabit, the film is desolate and without color or life.

why bother to see this movie? it probably rates an award for being the worst career move of a major movie star since clark gable's laughable playing of an irish patriot in parnell.it's inconceivable that bergman would choose both this movie and its director over a lucrative hollywood career where she could choose among the finest scripts and directors being offered at that time. to begin with, there was no script to work with except a few notes. then we are supposed to believe the polished bergman as a poor refugee willing to do anything to be released from a refugee camp, including marriage to a poor italian fisherman she doesn't even love. i read where anna magnani was the original choice for this part. if so, that made a lot more sense than to cast the luminous bergman in such a proletarian part. but since she was in love with her director, common sense flew out the window.so she goes to live in this poor village where the men must toil to extract a meager living from the sea. a place she obviously hates to be and where she doesn't fit in.her only friend is the village priest who knows she's not suited to the life of a poor fisherman's bride, but tells her that for the sake of love she must repress her true feelings of revulsion, and accept the poverty and despair she encounters each day. on top of all of this, there's this volcano always on the brink of erupting and drowning them all in hot lava. but like a true heroine, bergman revolts against her misery by declaring war on just about everyone else in this dreary film. she even goes as far as trying to seduce the village priest, in a scene that would generate laughter if it were not so pathetic. since her poor slob of a husband must lock her in a room to keep her from running away, she's forced to use her body to bribe a married man to take her off the island. to her, no sacrifice is too great; no man unapproachable if he is willing to help her to escape the island and her misery. i won't bother to tell you how this all ends. the no-script movie ending is as plausible as the rest of stromboli. i even remember (from seeing it on late night tv) that it had two different endings! so be warned if you should feel brave enough to sit through this king-size turkey and catch the miscast bergman. it led to her downfall in hollywood for the next seven years and she was condemned for sleeping with her director while still married to peter lindstrom. none of the movies she made with this director(whom she later married) are noteworthy except as proof of a career gone berserk. i kid you not. it's pretty embarrassing.- - soundtrack

my wife and i watched this movie because we plan to visit sicily and stromboli soon. fortunately (or unfortunately) the landscape and seascape (complete with tuna) are the only believable members of this cast. we expected reasonable well-written and well-acted movie, but were disappointed. its only redeeming grace is an extended and remarkable fishing sequence full of authenticity: thrashing tuna, nets, wooden boats with long oars, and passionate, if superstitious, fishermen.the movie's sequencing is stagy, its dialogue stilted, and the acting ranges from stiff to completely "over-the-top." one scene, in which bergman stresses out as her macho, native and naïve husband sics his ferret on an "innocent" (but apparently already deceased) rabbit would be perfect grist for a monty python skit.when the volcano blew we hoped for a merciful end to the suffering (ours and the casts'). unfortunately, the movie continues to flail on, staggering finally to a melodramatic and absurd ending. unless you're really into old-time tuna fishing, pass this hokey effort by.

before the days of home video, stan laurel's pre-hardy comedy 'kill or cure' was known -- to the extent that it was known at all -- only because a few sequences were included in robert youngson's compilation film 'laurel and hardy's laughing 20's'. youngson knew what he was doing: the best gags in 'kill or cure' were brought intact into his compilation, while the rest of this only mildly funny comedy remained on youngson's cutting-room floor.laurel portrays a commercial traveller, hawking a patent medicine cried professor i.o. dine's knox-all: that name is the funniest joke in this movie, which ain't sayin' much. i should point out that this movie dates from 1923, the shank of prohibition. during prohibition, quite a lot of americans purchased patent medicine if it had (ahem!) 'medicinal' properties, so -- if knox-all contains alcohol -- stan's job in this movie is less desperate than the one which he and ollie famously had in 'big business', selling christmas trees in the summer. too bad for this movie that it's not nearly so funny as 'big business'.we see stan (but don't hear him, in this silent film) delivering a spirited sales talk to a man who seems to be paying attention ... until we learn that they're standing outside a deaf-mute institution, and this man is deaf. a haughty woman emerges from the gates: stan quickly tries to engage her attention by wiggling his fingers at her. of course she's not deaf, and she promptly whacks him with her umbrella. i found this sequence offensive, not because it involves deaf people (the deaf aren't the butt of the joke) but because it abets the very widely-held misconception among hearing people that they can communicate with the deaf by merely waggling their fingers randomly and performing charades without actually learning the highly complex grammar of sign language.more amusingly, a spinster in this movie has a pet canary named rudolph (as in valentino), and there's a gag involving trick photography to enable a man to hide behind an object that's narrower than his body. i've seen this device in several cartoons and live-action movies but 'kill or cure' is, i think, the earliest movie to use it that i've seen so far.stan laurel, an under-rated actor, does one bit of physical business here that's worthy of chaplin or keaton, in which he conveys his emotions -- and a change in his demeanour -- while walking away from the camera with his back to us. still, laurel never really became a first-rate comedian until he united with oliver hardy to form the greatest comedy team ever. 'kill or cure' barely rates 3 out of 10.

first, let me start by saying that i am a laurel and hardy buff. i have read every book printed about them, and have seen all of their available films more than once. i even took a chance once, and called stan on the telephone. he was very kind, and spoke with me for over ten minutes. i followed with a letter, and he wrote me a letter back. i still have that letter.this film has some fine comedy moments, but stan and ollie are not up to their usual form. stan was gravely ill during the production and looked worse than he did ten years later. in my opinion, any laurel and hardy film is worth seeing.but the ultimate opinion of this film comes from the great stan laurel himself. to quote him, "this film should never have been made."

i hadn't seen this in many years. the acting was so good as i began this time, i thought, "great! another movie i misjudged as a foolish young man." but then the theme started to be clear and i felt the same way.this was hollywood, the seat of glamor; so the concept shouldn't be a surprise. but it is so condescending a concept i feel as if i need to take a shower after watching it. in brief, it tells us that even physically ugly people can seem beautiful to each other and even feel attractive.dorothy mcguire is likable as the homely heroine. she seems to have been filmed wearing minimal make-up. robert young is injured in the war and feels scarred. his parents can't bear to look at him either. he seems to have all his faculties and in part, the notions of disability are outmoded.herbert marshall is on hand as a blind pianist. his character speaks is hushed tones and is omniscient.the best performance is given by mildred natwick as the owner of the title residence. she is bitter and dour but not made of ice. her story is much more interesting, and believable, than that of mcguire and young.

this is a case of taking a fairy tale too far. the enchanted cottage delivers dorothy mcguire as a "terrible ugly" spinster and robert young as a disfigured pilot. long story short: scarface marries spinster, after which their love transforms them, miraculously (lighting, cosmetics and the removal of fake scars), into beautiful peoplea magical change that they attribute to the enchantment of living in a seaside cottage that has been the abode of generations of honeymooners.if the story stopped there, fine; it would be a fable with a proverbial message: beauty is in the eye of the beholder. but it lurches ahead, reaching for reality. when mr. and mrs. scarface greet their public, it comes as a painful shock to them that they're still homely. you see, they only appear beautiful to each other a situation which the audience is well prepared for because all the secondary characters have been sermonizing that ill-favored people really need to lower their expectations, and find other ways to be happy. you know. take up hobbies. spinster does woodcuts, for instance. scarface considers collecting driftwood.the original playwright (arthur wing pinero) and the filmmakers have zero faith in human nature. their message is: you're either ugly or pretty, and no pretty person would ever love an ugly one. what's even worse, ugly people evidently need to imagine their lover as pretty. reality just won't do.one wonders what elaine mason saw every day when she looked at her husband, stephen hawking.

usa's azn tv purchased the rights to this film and the network is showing it using the english title the pickpocket.1997's the pickpocket takes amateur home-movie style movie making to amazing levels of unpleasantness. the movie depicts a long-winded series of boring wanderings of an uninteresting, confused guy. this lead character, xiao wu, does not simply walk about aimlessly. viewers will unfortunately soon realize that xiao wu has an unsurpassed talent to seek out, and remain dormant near the most obnoxious noises to be found in china. clanging empty tin buckets being beaten with a stick -- he is there. every old motor in china clunking in agony -- he is there. a crying baby? yes, you guessed it, he is there! according to the pickpocket, china is the most irritating unpleasant sounding place on planet earth.the only element worse than the sound of the pickpocket is the photography. the camera shakes, shakes and shakes some more. finally, the camera stills, but then it falls to the actor's knees and just stays there until someone in the crew realizes the mistake and begins to shake the camera again. most of the shaky film is framed in distant, long, long, long shots. the few times when the camera gets somewhat close, nothing compelling ever takes place to connect the viewer with what is happening.the photography is murky, faded and often blurry. the use of color is -- well, there is no sign of intelligence controlling the use of color. most every shot is held 20 times too long. few movies are so painful to sit through. this film is painful to watch, and painful to hear. and then it simply ends.john woo fans might enjoy being able to hear part of the soundtrack to die xue shuang xiong (the killer) as the lead character is hanging outside of a video store for many minutes. anyway, be warned -- the pickpocket will steal away your good time.

this movie should have ended as soon as the joke about bebe's kids is told in the opening. i liked robin harris and most of his comedy but the really funny routines were not meant to be something the whole family could go see. liken it to taking the point of one of jerry seinfeld's jokes and attempting to squeeze the joke for as long as you can in order to turn it into a movie. this movie had to be self-serving because i can not find anyone who found the settings or antics familiar. whats most funny about this movie is the gumption of the writers and producers to pass it off as something of value. 1/10 stars because there is no half star.

my brother was working at a movie theater when i saw this movie; i saw it for free and still walked out. i have seen a lot of movies in my time but this was the worst. when people ask me what the worst movie i have ever seen was i mention this movie in less than one second. this movie is bad because it goes from one lame plot set-up to the next, it encourages stereotypes about blacks that are sickening and the flow is awful. if you want to see how to make children cry and vomit at the same time then study this movie. okay, this movie is not good "bad" but terrible bad. if you are like one of those people that watch horrible movies for fun, like me, you will not even be able to make it through this very short film. please for the love of god destroy all copies of this movie.

"atoll k" aka "utopia" is one of hollywood's saddest swan songs. filmed in france, "the land that loves lewis (jerry)" in 1950 and released the following year after a five-year layoff, the boys are in truly terrible shape physically. however, they aren't in nearly as bad a shape as the script.this movie is one of the un-funniest "comedies" ever filmed.it's painful to see this legendary team, the funniest duo in the history of motion pictures, the twosome that made "the devil's brother" (1933), "the music box," (1932),"pack up your troubles" (also 1932), "babes in toyland" (1934), "bonnie scotland" (1935), "flying deuces" (1939) and so many more gut-wrenching, laugh-til-you-choke classic comedies, in a film such as this.but fighters and ballplayers do it all the time. they stay in the game one season or one fight too many. in this case, while is morbidly fascinating to see laurel & hardy at this late stage in their legendary careers, they, too, stuck around for one too many.

when the movie begins, it's obvious just how old and sick the boys are. although oliver hardy is enormous, it is stanley that looks like death warmed over. apparently, he was deathly ill during production and had obviously lost a lot of weight. although he would eventually recover and live another decade and a half, here he looks like a dying man. additionally, as i watched the film i was shocked how many pratfalls stan took--i half expected his to drop dead from the exertion. i really can't understand why they came out of retirement considering their health--especially when the story and production values are as poor as they are with this film. stanley inherits an island and a boat. he and ollie are ready to leave when antoine, a stateless man, is literally dropped into their boat and they begin their voyage to find the island. along the way, they discover that giovanni has stowed away, but despite this the four men become friends and land on a different island. it seems like paradise and they are all very happy. a bit later, a pretty young lady joins them and everything looks grand.unfortunately, uranium is discovered on the island and the place becomes flooded with riffraff. eventually, the mob decides to hang the four men and take over--at which point the island sinks back into the sea and the men are spared.i will give the film some credit for being original and for being interesting. however, one thing it is not is funny--and that is unforgivable for a laurel and hardy flick. while not a bad film, it certainly isn't a good one. a sad end to their brilliant careers.all the actors, except for the duo, are dubbed into english, as the movie was made in france. while it may not be the very worst film they made (this would be the big noise), it sure is close!! watching this film is painful and like watching people clean up after a severe accident.

i was invited to view this film at a small art museum screening. i had no clue what to expect. i was initially optimistic in the opening credits to see judd nelson, bill paxton, wayne newton, james cann, rob lowe, and lara-flynn-boyle listed. however after some very disturbing grossed-out scenes (that did not add much to the story advancement), this film quickly became a weapon of torture. the gimmick of the vestigial growing arm storyline is never really developed. i patiently kept waiting for this film to cash-in. there was a small payoff in the end, but having to invest and sit through the the endless gross, crude, sexually-perverted, in-your-face screaming, unfunny gore cost too much for me (even for a free viewing). what were these established actors doing in this awful film? the art direction was very convincing and creepy. at the very minimum, it should only be a 75-minute film. this is a film that dick cheney and donald rumsfeld would embrace.

this film was such a mess i actually reimbursed my friends who i dragged to see it. the only reason i went to see it was that my friend was an apprentice editor on the shoot.i'm sure that this film was meant to be campy, but the approach was so heavy-handed and self-reflexive it turned out really flat. judd nelson stars as an obsequious garbage man who is a hack comedian on the side. his life is hell and made worse by his obnoxious and overbearing companion bill paxton (who i feel embarrassed for - this was a really tasteless role for a talented actor). a freak accident alters nelson's career course and mayhem ensues.the attempts at humor were corny, predictable and often base and tasteless. wayne newton in the cast as a talent agent is a novelty but he adds nothing - comedically or otherwise.overall, it's a very weak and uncreative attempt at camp humor that goes over like a lead balloon. at least you could laugh at plan 9 from outer space. this one just makes you wonder who thought this was a good enough idea to finance and film. one of the all time worst bombs you'll ever witness.

ok, fans, it's out on dvd. but the only reason to watch this is 1) to say you did (due to its notoriety), or 2) if you're a hardcore bill paxton fan. i am not a hardcore bp fan but he was fun to watch and it was the only thing that kept me from turning this off from sheer boredom. it's a shame, because this could have been a good movie with some script work and if made by someone with some intelligence (and with a cast led by someone besides the totally miscast and talentless judd nelson). sure it's gross, but it's bad, and not in a good way. if after reading all the comments on how bizarrely revolting and dystopianly filthy this movie is you are still interested, do yourself a favor and see some good bizarre revolting dystopian filth instead. films by john waters, david lynch, peter jackson's "braindead", henenlotter's "basket case", etc., all come to mind. there's lots better out there.

teenager tamara (jenna dewan) has it rough. she's ridiculed by all the popular "kids" for being shy, bookish, frumpy and because of her interest in witchcraft. all of the football players and cheerleaders are especially angry at her for writing an article on steroid abuse for the school paper. on top of this, her dad's a drunk, her mom's not around and she's secretly in love with her supportive english teacher (matthew marsden). the popular kids set up a cruel prank to humiliate her, accidentally kill her during a struggle, bury the body in the woods and make a pact to keep silent. to their shock, the very next day tamara walks back into the classroom looking seductive and, uh, dressed to kill. yep, back from the dead and ready for supernatural revenge against everyone involved. she also takes time out to make her sexually abusive pop eat a beer bottle and tries to seduce her english teacher away from his wife (claudette mink), a guidance counselor at the school.acting and writing are strictly mediocre. you can also tell the people responsible for this have seen such movies as carrie (1976), hello mary lou: prom night ii (1987) and the craft (1996) because it borrows wholesale from all three of those superior films. there's some gore (a guy cutting off his ear and tongue and then stabbing his eyeball probably being the best bit), a nasty vomiting scene and a few campy/witty one-liners. not an awful film by any means, but not much originality went into it either.

"tamara" just felt like another teen oriented knock-off of the "i know what you did last summer" trend and is painfully dull. a high school outcast, who is heavily into witchcraft and black magic, is accidentally killed during a cruel prank carried out by a group of bullies who secretly bury her in the woods, vowing to tell no one. the next day, the supposedly "dead" tamara, arrives at school with a completely new image and seduces her would-be killers and has a little revenge... this is basically a combination of "carrie", "the craft", and every other straight-to-video, teeny bopper turkey that hits the shelves these days. the actors are absolutely atrocious and look about ten years too old to pass off as high schoolers. there is some gore, which is actually nothing all that interesting since the movie is so boring and i couldn't wait for it to end. if you like modern garbage than i insist you seek this one out, otherwise don't bother...

i saw this movie, and i do like horror movies.i did not know what to expect, but as soon the movie was on his way it was nice to watch it. the idea was pretty original and the acting was nice. especially jenna dewan as the exciting/evil tamara.the hardest thing about horror movies, is to make a good ending. but there the movie failed. for a change, a end-scene in a hospital, where suddenly all employees are gone. first you see doctors and nurses running around, but then they all went home?no cries for help while being chased by tamara, escaping to the roof (also a smart move...not) and off course a kind of open ending.no....the movie started great, the main part was nice to watch, but they really messed up the ending using all clichés from bad horror movies. jeffrey reddick failed in my eyes with this movie, after making some really quality movies like final destination 1 and 2.if you like a good horror full of cliché endings, tamara is a good movie to watch. for me, i like movies which surprise me.

i am working at a video store so i got to see this one for free- thank god, had i paid for it my review would be less forgiving.well, the major idea of the film (geeky girl takes bloody revenge) isn't all that original, there are several parallels to "carrie" (playing a mean practical joke on a loser, except for one nice girl that is actually sorry for her, tamaras and carries bad family background). i still think it's a fun idea for trashy teen horror flick unfortunately they didn't take much advantage of the potentials that are here and rather put an emphasis on all the wrong things.what worked: i liked the actress that played tamara. she looked great (when she was hot) and her catty lines were fun ("sean can't come to the phone. he's f**king patrick!").what didn't work: the whole wicca thing was silly. i generally prefer rational explanations (she could have ploted the whole thing with her teacher or one of the boys to get her revenge). there were a lot of logical wholes and the gore looked really bad (when the boy is cutting of his ear and his tongue- please!!!)the whole idea wasn't bound for oscar buzz, but i just think they wasted the comedic and the suspenseful potential they had. it was bearable but far from good!

star rating: ***** unmissable **** very good *** okay ** you could go out for a meal instead * avoid at all costs the tale of the titular adam (mark o' halloran) and paul (tom murphy), two heroin addicts in the slums of dublin and their daily amblings about in their meaningless lives searching for the next fix that will make their day. along the way they try and reconcile with close family and friends who they've managed to let down and destroy over the years.i know a lot of irish people like to drink, but it seems some of them have problems with heroin, too by the looks of this movie. i know there is a bit of a drug problem over there, like there is in many parts of the world, so another humorous take on the subject matter is not an entirely unexpected thing.i don't recall the last irish movie i saw (the film is shot in a style that makes it stand out from any film i've seen lately!) and, judging from that, obviously i'm not as enlightened on their humour as i could be. the film is rather funny in certain parts, but it's obviously another comedy that isn't afraid to raise near-the-knuckle laughs. the scene in which the mentally disabled boy is robbed down the back of an alley is certainly true of what a pair of junkies might do to feed their habit but is nonetheless utterly despicable and i'm not sure if it was meant as dark humour in any way but it certainly didn't put a smile on my face! it's also in stark contrast to their previous actions where they're seen showing their soft side rocking a baby to-and-fro. in light of this, some may find the ending sad, others may see it as just desserts.overall, i just failed to see the point to the film. i didn't see any motivation in the 'story' it was telling. it just seems to amble along without really involving the audience in any way. unlike trainspotting (which dealt with similar themes!) it's an unsuccessful effort for the most part that had me on the verge of nodding off despite it's very short 83 minute running time. really no more enjoyable than following two real life junkies around for a day. **

i saw the film yesterday and stopped it at half time because i felt it was a waste of time. the idea to make a film through the eyes of a headsman - one of the "evil guys" throughout most fantasy and medieval films - is great and offers plenty of possibilities but... the film couldn't catch one of them. i was not feeling for any of the characters, the plot was all too predictable (to the point that i followed it)and the second leap of time in the storyline made me quit. those who expect a deep insight into the emotional situation of a headsman in the middle ages, a social outcast to that time, might be disappointed.

this had the promise of being an interesting film. the subject matter was certainly a promising one - the excesses of the catholic church during the counter-reformation. however, not only was this not developed (other than a two paragraph introduction), many things were not explained - i.e. the gypsies, the anabaptists, the inquisitors and their relationship to the one true church. nor were the politics of the time explained, i.e. the relationship between the catholic church and its supporters like the holy roman emperor. though these may have been apparent to an austrian audience, the lack of explanation makes it confusing for americans.but perhaps it's a good thing that they didn't emphasize the history since what they showed was pretty inaccurate anyway. instruments of torture, bloody executions, witch and heretic burnings, big shiny swords and pretty golden reliquaries are the stars of the film. it could have just as easily been one of those conan-type sword and sorcery movies, only with period costumes...

the biggest problem with "in search of historic jesus" is that there is very little search to it at all. shick-sunn produced these "documentary" films in the 1970s and just into the '80s, which featured interviews with "experts" and discussion of "science" and "facts" to make a case for whatever the title of the film was looking to cash in on.sadly, "historic jesus" is really little more than a third-rate dramatization of the life of christ. unlike shick-sunn's more superior "in search of noah's ark" which spends the majority of its running time discussing the possibility that the ark is resting on the earth today and where that might be, this film is basically the story of jesus with no effort made to prove or disprove his existence. the famed shroud of turrin is mentioned, but little other detective work is given much screen time.for fans of these quasi-documentary films like "jupiter menace" and "in search of bigfoot", etc., this movie doesn't offer much.

as a documentary, this is laughable in a campy sort of way -- a schlocky collection of re-created biblical tableaux mixed in with solemn interviews of so-called "experts." think of it as an infommercial which pushes jesus instead of thigh-masters. however, the detailed crucifixion scene is, in terms of historical accuracy, superior to similar scenes in such widescreen hollywood extravaganzas as "ben-hur," "king of kings," and "the greatest story ever told." rather than dragging his entire cross to golgotha, for example, john rubinstein simply carries his crossbeam strapped across his shoulders to his outstretched arms. nails aren't driven through his palms but instead through his wrists. his feet aren't nailed separately but one is placed over the other so that just one nail need be used. incidentally, rubinstein's flogging prior to his crucifixion ranks 35th in the book, "lash! the hundred great scenes of men being whipped in the movies."of course, rubinstein and the two thieves wear modest loincloths, which probably isn't true to the shameful reality of roman crucifixions, but allowances must be made. curiously, the "good" thief is positioned on the left hand of jesus, which goes against a long-standing tradition. just why this thief is played by a pudgy, overweight man is, however, a mystery, especially in view of the fact that the "bad" thief is something of a "hunk."

am not from america, i usually watch this show on axn channel, i don't know why this respected channel air such sucking program in prime time slot. creation of hollywood's money bank jerry bruckheimer, this time he is spending a big load of cash in the small screen. in each episode a bunch of peoples having two team members travels from on country to another for a great sum of money; where the camera crews shoot their travels. i don't know who the hell gave this stupid idea for the show. it has nothing to watch for, in all episodes we see people ran like beggars, some times shouting, crying, beeping, jerky camera works..huh it's harmful to both eyes and ears. the most disgusting part in the race is the viewers finally knows each of the team members can't enjoy their race/traveling experience. even though, to add up the ratings the producers came up with the ideas of including gays in one shows, sucking american reality show.it's nothing to watch for, better switch to another channels.the amazing race = the disgusting show.

scarlet dawn casts douglas fairbanks, jr. as a russian baron rudely displaced by the forces of the russian revolution and now has to fend for himself in a world not terribly hospitable to former aristocrats. he's also not terribly suited for any kind of real work. doug might have been caught by the reds but for the fact that his former servant nancy carroll didn't give him away. nancy's got a big old crush on doug and they do marry once arriving in exile in istanbul which throughout the film is referred to by its former christian name of constantinople. they marry and settle down with doug now reduced to washing dishes.but fairbanks's former mistress lilyan tashman who's always playing bad girls of a sort on film spots him and offers to have him get back into somewhat the style he was once accustomed to as part of a swindle against father and daughter american tourists guy kibbee and sheila terry. good thing this film has the incredibly short running time of only 57 minutes, usually those were given to b westerns because it's both tedious and melodramatic. the ending is rather unbelievable. doug knew he was in a thanksgiving special and really overacts to cover up the defects of a unbelievable story.what i didn't understand was that fairbanks was trained in the military profession, why didn't he just become a mercenary soldier after leaving the new soviet union? that didn't make sense to me at all.i'd only see this if i was a dedicated fan of any the main players.

this movie has lots of action and little heart. let's forget for a minute that it gets just about every aspect of the russian revolution wrong - after all we only have only under an hour here to tell our story. in fact, the czar abdicated after world war i proved a disaster for the country, and a provisional government tried to rule as a pseudo-democracy until the leninists took power nine months later, mainly because they promised to immediately withdraw russia from the war. now, back to our story.here we have the revolution being "rumored" in russian newspapers in what appears to still be a functioning country until violence erupts suddenly and upends the life of nobleman baron nikita 'nikki' krasnoff (douglas fairbanks jr.). he flees his home with his former servant girl tanyusha (nancy carroll) in tow, and they start to make a new life in constantinople. before the revolution the baron made a regular habit out of making a play for the girl, not out of any real passion, but out of boredom as a diversion of sorts. the revolution doesn't change this, and he continues to try to take advantage of what is obviously a very simple girl. it certainly doesn't make the audience like this guy to see him toying with her so. tanyusha follows the baron because she literally has no place to go after the revolutionaries take over the baron's home, and she has known no other life other than waiting on nikki hand and foot. once in constantinople, nikki quickly wearies of life as a penniless laborer, and that is when he meets up with his former lover, russian aristocrat vera zimina, who has a plan for getting them to paris where the tsarists have congregated after the revolution. unfortunately for tanyusha, vera's plan does not include her.this film manages to completely waste the considerable acting talents of early talkie actress nancy carroll. she does a good job with what little she is given to do, but that is not much. lilyan tashman is the standout here, even though she has only a small role as russian vamp vera. lilyan was so often given supporting roles just as she is here, but her earthy voice and glamorous looks make her the center of attention in every scene in which she appears. guy kibbee even shows up in a humorous bit as an american tourist who is curious about the russian royalty that has been forcefully ejected from their homeland.

this is quite possibly one of the worst movies ever made. everything about it--acting, directing, script, cinematography--is dreadful. the alien (a human in sparkly suit) claims to be from a nearby universe; one assumes the scriptwriter meant "galaxy" but didn't bother to get a dictionary to check his terms. a better title for the film would be "it came from the planet of plot contrivances." the plot is excessively silly and nearly nonexistent. the humans are all given magical macguffins that conform to a tortuous series of unlikely restrictions just to move the bare plot. any thought to the passage of time is ignored. now it's a couple days after meeting the alien, then bam! all of a sudden there's only a couple hours left until zero hour. do yourself a favor and miss this movie. you will make yourself stupider for having watched it. the ending is particularly silly, and should have been accompanied by someone going "ta-da!!!!" as the scriptwriter just pulls something random out of his butt. i think the real alien plot is that this movie sucks so bad you'll get cancer watching it. if you can watch the last 10 minutes without crapping yourself ("enemies of freedom"--honestly) laughing, you're retarded.

an intelligent summation of cold war era mutually assured destruction policy, up until the conclusion: it's a gasser! all russians and chinese are obliterated from the face of the earth! saw this one at the 27th annual cwru science fiction marathon, january 2002.

i made sure to see this film because it is a 1950s sci-fi film--one of my favorite genres. unfortunately, while i was looking forward to either bug-eyed aliens or power-mad conquerers, the aliens in this film were a major disappointment! first, you only see one very briefly at the beginning (and he looked pretty ordinary) and you also only got a tiny glimpse of a spaceship! second, the alien was neither the evil conquerer or the benevolent friend of mankind--but a real odd-ball. and finally, the plot itself seemed so dumb, preachy and heavy-handed that it elicited more yawns than thrills.as the film begins, five people from five different parts of the world (germany, britain, russia, china and the usa) are kidnapped by an alien. the alien gives each of them devices by which they can destroy all life on the planet if they so choose--because, the alien admits that his race of people would love to inhabit the earth but they themselves won't kill to get it. then, he returns them all. while it's 100% obvious that no one would want to use these devices, the alien then announces on tv the identities of the five without telling that the weapons are that powerful! so, all the militarists in the world want to find the five and force them to reveal how the weapons work. much of the rest of the film consists of some of the five going into hiding and one being tortured to get him to reveal how the device works--as the soviets want to use it!!! this part of the film just seemed pretty silly. sure the ussr was an evil and corrupt nation (sorry, but it's fact--especially under stalin), they never would have thought of using it like they did in the movie! later, one of the five (the german scientist), somehow figures out that the devices can also be used to kill only all the evil people who hate freedom. so, he uses it to wipe out all the evil commies and presumably others who were anti-freedom and the world then becomes a paradise!! preachy, silly and full of plot holes--this movie just isn't worth your time, though it is an interesting relic simply for the way it addresses communism--in particular, the tensions between nato and the soviets.

this is another of hollywood's anti-communist polemics of the golden 1950s. stalwart american gene barry, lovely englishwoman valerie french, and three others are kidnapped by an alien and given clamshells containing fantastic--and fantastically vague--power. what will the earthlings do with such power? toss it in the sea or use it to wipe out all of mankind? anybody who knows american cinema circa 1957 knows the answer to what the commies will do, but the story gets ripe when the americans actually test the things in the middle of the pacific. then one scientist, alone with the ultimate power in the universe, comes up with his own theory and uses it! his smarmy attitude afterward is nauseating, and the cheery disposition of everyone else is appalling.here's the spoiler for this dog: the capsules inside the clamshells have a mathematical code that tells the prof that they kill only "confirmed enemies of freedom"! that's right--don't worry about the ethical conundrum of killing everyone that an alien pill decides is an enemy of freedom; just do it! hurray! no commies! silly female--and you threw yours into the sea! ha ha! kiss me, baby!

just listen to the broadway cast album and to the voices of barbara harris and john cullum, who do wonders for the wonderful lerner and lane score. then, with that beautiful cast recording fresh in mind, watch the movie, with streisand as streisand, and yves montand reading his lines with such a heavy french accent that a chain saw couldn't cut through it. the best part (for those who need something to look forward to) is what montand does to the introductory part of the title song. listen as he sings/says: could anyone among us have an inkling or a clue, what magic feats of wizardry and voodoo you can do? (that one part sums up the problem that results from casting "name stars" in movie musicals instead of the appropriate talent for the various roles.) i can just see rex harrison entering that scene and suggesting montand, too, could learn to do justice to the beauty of the english language.

"on a clear day you can see forever" is nothing more than a new age update of the "pygmalion" / "my fair lady" story: a professor attempts to turn a common girl into an upper society woman. this time, however, instead of using language skills, the professor tries to do so by hypnotism and past life regression.you know a musical has problems when reviewers constantly mention the sets and the costumes before they mention the plot and the music. the songs are instantly forgettable. (no "get me to the church on time" here, i'm afraid.) and the plot goes nowhere. to paraphrase gertrude stein, there is no "there" here. the characters wander through the story without ever getting from point a to point b. professor chabot claims several times that he will get to the root of daisy's troubles, but he never seems to do so.all meaningful conflict is avoided. for instance, there comes a time when chabot's university demands he either stop his research into reincarnation or resign his position. now there is conflict! will he give up his career for daisy? alas! nothing comes of this development. a scene or two later the university changes its mind and tells chabot to continue on with his work. so much for conflict.the talent was certainly assembled for this movie: directed by vincente minnelli. written, in part, by alan jay lerner. a cast of yves montand, bob newhart and jack nicholson. and, oh yes, starring barabara striesand who was nearly at the top of her game at this point in her career.but it all falls flat. lerner's attempt to reincarnate his greatest success, the previously mentioned "my fair lady," is as doomed to failure as daisy's attempt to revive the greatness of her own past.if you enjoy movie musicals, there are far better choices than this.

in trying to keep up with the hipness of youthful audiences as the 70s approached, oacd,ycsf was the product of odder and odder material selected for musicalization. here it's past life regression, esp and hypno-therapy... pretty loopy! the real problem with the concept (music or not) are the extraordinarily low dramatic stakes; just where can a movie go, and what can happen, when a man falls in love with a previous incarnation of a girl he can't stand? it can't go any place new, but strangely, it can't even go any place old! indeed, if it could, audiences would still have no interest in the union of yves montand (playing a much older, arrogant, french ass) and streisand. (a much younger girl). we never become invested in them, their situations or outcomes. montand is miscast and his strong accent makes many of his lyrics unintelligible.it's all been given a shallow 60s veneer that makes it eminently disposable; despite efforts here and there from minelli that are respectable. it's not even adapted from a non-musical story that met with any previous success... that's just too passe! streisand occasionally has some funny business to offer, as when she's trying not to fall asleep on her roof and improvises an energetic dance. but she over-relies on her ingratiating (translation: irritating) kooky, jewish girl shtick. she can however sing very well, at both the "gentle" and "powerhouse" ends of the range. amidst a score of musical dross, she gets 3 or 4 amazing songs* of much higher caliber than anything fanny or dolly had to offer. 'he isn't you' is a sweet trifle as sublime as lorenz hart's 'my funny valentine,' but the movie isn't able to realize any impact from it; because the lyrics don't seem to be referring to anything in the movie, and nothing remotely suggests a great love is blossoming between chabot and melinda.the only cut we can view is a poor hatchet job of a much bigger film. strong research shows a longer, better-explained and more decorative, but not necessarily a better film at: http://barbra-archives.com/films/clear_day_streisand_2.html. you can be sure there's be more babs in that version but more importantly, there'd be more thoughtful work from minelli.in the end montand sends babs off to sing the title song, after she discovers he's a total dick who feeds her a self-esteem homily to allow himself off the hook. and she takes the bait. so, uh... hooray for that.(*hurry it's lovely up here, love with all the trimmings, he isn't you, & the title song)

last time i checked, the nazis didn't win the second world war - not that you'd sodding notice. after all, the third reich was pretty big on issuing orders and demanding cold, robotic obedience from the populace, and that's pretty much what we're saddled with today. but the way the orders are delivered has changed. instead of being barked at in a german accent through a loudhailer, they're disguised as concerned expert advice and floated under your nose every time you switch on the tv or flip open a newspaper there's a continual background hum, a middle-class message of self-improvement, whispered on the wind."you eat too much. you eat the wrong things. you drink. you smoke. you don't get enough exercise. you probably can't even *beep* properly. you'll die if you don't change your ways. your health will suffer. have you got no self-respect? look at you. you sicken me. i pity you. i hate you. we all hate you. god hates you. don't you get it? it's so sad, what you're doing to yourself. it's just so bloody sad." that's the mantra. and it goes without saying that the people reciting it are routinely depicted as saints. last year, the media dropped to its knees to give jamie oliver a collective blow job over his school dinners series, in which he campaigned to get healthier food put on school menus. given the back-slapping reaction, you'd be forgiven for thinking he'd personally rescued 5,000 children from the jaws of a slavering paedophile.anyway, the series was a huge success. in fact in telly terms there was only one real drawback: it wasn't returnable. after all, when you've saved every child in the nation from certain death once, you can't really do it a second time. the only solution is to find a new threat, which brings us to ian wright's unfit kids (wed, 9pm, c4), a weekly "issuetainment" programme in which the former footballer and renowned enemy of grammar forces a bunch of overweight youngsters to take part in some extra-curricular pe.it's essentially a carbon copy of the jamie oliver show, with more sweating and fewer shots of pupils mashing fresh basil with a pestle: an uplifting fable in which wrighty shapes his gang of misfits into a lean, mean, exercising' machine - combating apathy and lethargy, confronting lazy parents, and attempting to turn the whole thing into a nationwide issue that'll have range rover mums everywhere dampening their knickers with sheer sanctimony in between trips to the conran shop. oh isn't it simply terrible, what these blob-some plebes do to themselves? not our josh you understand: he eats nothing but organic spinach and attends lacrosse practise six hundred times a week.bet he does, the little sh1t yes, it is heartwarming to watch flabby, inconvenient kids transforming themselves with a bit of simple activity... but there's something about the underlying eat-your-greens message that really sticks in my craw, in case you hadn't guessed.what happened to the concept of choice, you *beep* so a bit of jogging might increase your life expectancy - so what? that just equates to a few more years in the nursing home - whoopee do. and besides, i'd rather drop dead tomorrow than spend the rest of my life sharing a planet with a bunch of smug toss ends trying to out-health one another.in episode two, video games and the internet are singled out as villains in the war on flab: they make kids too sedentary, you see. oddly enough, tv, which is equally sedentary, and unlike those two activities, actively encourages you to let your mind atrophy along with your physique, escapes without a rollicking. funny that.well listen here, channel 4 - instead of forcing kids to eat bracken or do squat-thrusts, how about teaching them to think more expansively, so they reject the sly, cajoling nature of programmes like this? or would that be a campaign too far?

the moral of this show is that bad eating habits give people bad hair, bad taste in clothes, bad posture, bad jobs, and on and on. they are obviously miserable and loathe themselves. however, if they learn to eat broccoli, they will be wealthy, successful, and attractive. tlc ought to be ashamed of themselves for this blatant exploitation of parental fears and guilt. if nutrition is really that important, they should be able to develop a show using honest and truthful methods. if they really believed in their computer simulations, i'd like to see them do a double-blind test by finding some 40-year-olds, finding out what their eating and exercise habits were as children, and age-progressing the kids' photos. then compare to the real things. hey, that sounds like a project for mythbusters! discovery channel--are you listening?tlc must stand for tabloid lies and cons.

well, i don't normally think there's such a thing as a horrible movie, but this is pretty damned close! the best acting performance in the whole thing was snoop dogg, who has one line in a 10 second scene. i agree with the "glad it was short" review. the music videos at the end were cool though.

this movie rips off of every mobster/gangster film ever made. mp da last don has a reference to every movie. the acting was by far the worst i have every seen. who the hell is john mario anyway? his acting was by far the worst i have ever seen. he makes bad actors look good. as far as master p goes, he's selling out quicker than an n*sync concert. i really wish i was there to tell the whole production company: what the hell were you thinking when penning the script?" obviously these people are so fixated on the gangster image that they decided to make a movie and live out their gangster lives for real in their minds. one thing i do know is that there wasn't anyone who wanted to distribute this film so it seems (and how predictable) that the guys at no limit had to start; no limit films. i've said enough! this movie is terrible and it does not deserve to be called a movie!

when i saw this movie i think i was a freshman in high school and i still feel like charging master p for the hour & 20 mins or so that he took from my life that i'll never get back.the guy who already posted is completely right. master p is a wannabe mobster. he, like all the other rappers in this country made his millions off of selling rap cds to young impressionable white kids in this country. it's widely known that the mob was not a black thing and blacks were not allowed to be part of it. unfair as that might be rappers can't deal with. this movie paints master p as a mobster named nino? the script is terrible with the acting to match. completely unbelievable. while searching i came up with a link or something that said he was planning on making another movie called "the black sopranos"!!!!please spare us that and stick to nickalodeon. you are not a white mobster, your not even a good actor master p, please stick to your music for the sake of whoever listens to it these days...

this is one entertaining flick. i suggest you rent it, buy a couple quarts of rum, and invite the whole crew over for this one. my favorite parts were.1. the gunfights that were so well choreographed that john woo himself was jealous, .2. the wonderful special effects .3. the academy award winning acting and .4. the fact that every single gangsta in the film seemed to be doing a bad "scarface" impersonation. i mean, master p as a cuban godfather! this is groundbreaking territory. and with well written dialogue including lines like "the only difference between you and me rico, is i'm alive and your dead," this movie is truly a masterpiece. yeah right.

this has to be one of, if not the greatest mob/crime films of all time. every thing about this movie is great, the acting in this film is of true quality; master p's acting skills make you actually believe he is italian! the cinematography is excellent too, probably the best ever. this movie was great; and i have the brain capacity of an earth worm.

on the scale of 1 to 10, i gave this a 4. i thought the film was not very good, with too much violence and not one character to like.on an erotic scale, i give this a 6. many of the sex scenes were tinged with an underlying ugliness. i always enjoy nudity, and nancy travis and faye grant come through, but the sex scenes were more humiliating than erotic.

why lori petty was cast as tank girl, i'll never know. her acting performance is lack-luster. her voice is grating. it's almost impossible for me to put into words how bad this movie is.there are several "modern-pop" references in the film, which i found to be very strange, given that the movie was supposed to take place far in the future. it wouldn't have been hard to make this premise interesting either. some better writing would have helped loads.naomi watts makes an appearance in it as a mild mannered techno-geek. i think they should have probably switched roles.i'll never know why anyone would like this movie, unless they were a petty fan.try not to see this movie. total waste of time.

sometimes a movie cannot easily be classified. such a film is "tank girl", part cartoon, part comedy, and part action flick. i'm sure somewhere there is an audience for "tank girl', but it is extremely small, perhaps punk comic book readers. most viewers will be looking for an early exit or living with the fast forward button. the only redeeming quality are short bursts of humor "find me a microscope and a pair of tweezers", but these tiny moments of comic relief are far outweighed by the sophomoric action sequences. there is no character development, which is not surprising, since the source is a comic book. do yourself a favor and avoid, avoid, avoid. - merk

this film doesn't know what it wants to be: is it making fun of action movies in general? is it satirical? is it supposed to be a black comedy? this is truly one of the worst films ever made.lori petty is annoying. there, i said what everyone else is thinking. it's bad enough that she's such a terrible actress (route 666, bates motel), but she doesn't even qualify as a mediocre b-movie actress. her screechy voice, strange mannerisms, and poor comic timing dot this film from start to finish, until you just want to put your head in a vise and end the pain.do yourself a favor and avoid this movie at all costs. you'll be glad you did.

maybe it's because i'm no fan of the comics (but if the comics are of the same "quality" as the movie, it's hard to believe there are any), but this has to be one of the worst movies ever made. non-existent plot, laughable acting, dumb dialogue... this movie is so bad that it hurts. a lot. that some people actually gave this one 10/10 is an insult to any good or at least mediocre (or at least bad) movie. if you hate yourself, then watch tank girl! on another thought, if you hate yourself that much, maybe you should just commit suicide... my rating: -34/10

i made the mistake of buying this since i collect comic book inspired movies. even at 6$ it was too expensive. i thought there might be some campy fun in it, a "so bad" it becomes good vibe perhaps, i was wrong. i had watched it once long ago and didn't remember any of it. now i know why. i was bored out of my mind and was looking for distractions to do something else. i'm all for grrrrl power, punk attitude and absurd humor but tank girl does not work on any front. the script is bad, you don't care about the characters and the humor is mostly lame except for a few amusing one-liners. the special effects or locations are poor or often replaced by comic panels or animations that are just too jarring compared to the live-action. it's like they didn't have the money to shoot the cool stuff and so resorted to drawings, however cool they might be (an uncensored animated feature would be way better for tank girl now that i think about it). the action scenes were cheesy but not in a fun b-movie way. the tank itself was far from impressive or dynamic although it was interestingly decorated. as a matter of fact, the best action scenes involving the tank were in animation. it does have some interesting songs by known artists such as bjork, hole and portishead but instead of improving the atmosphere, they just don't fit most of the time. once they even break into a ludicrous song and dance number that was just senseless and horrible. i think that's when i totally tuned out. i suppose tank girl, played by lori petty, looks the trashy punkette part but beyond her "attitude" and sometimes barely amusing retorts, is more two-dimensional and superficial than the worst comic book characters. jet, played by naomi watts, is probably the only saving grace of the film and it's amazing how such a good actress was involved in this mess. malcolm mcdowell wasn't too bad playing his usual villain role. it might be a cult movie for some but please consider that it's really different from the original independent comics and the original creators were disappointed with the movie themselves (check out the entry for tank girl on wikipedia). rating: 3 out of 10

oh my... bad clothing, worse synth music and the worst: david hasselhoff. the 80's are back with vengeance in witchery, an american-italian co-production, helmed by infamous joe 'd'amato on the production side and short-careered director (thank heavens for small miracles) fabrizio laurenti directing . marketed as a kind of sequel to sam raimi's evil dead series in italy (that was dubbed "la casa" in there), witchery delivers some modest gore groceries and bad acting.a mix of ghost story, possessions and witchcraft, the film bounces clueless from scene to another without letting some seriously wooden actors and hilarious day and night mix-ups slow it's progress to expectable ending, topped with some serious wtf surprise climax. (i just love the look on her face...) surprisingly laurenti manages to gather some suspense and air of malice in few - very few - scenes; unluckily for him, these few glimpses of mild movie magic go down quickly and effectively.the plus sides are experienced, when the gore hits the fan. this department is quite effective and entertaining in that classic latex and red paint style of the 80's italo-gore, when things were made 100% hand-made and as shockingly and vivid as modest budgets could allow. i could only watch with sadistic glee and few laughters all the over-the-top ways that obnoxious characters (and actors) got mangled and misused, one by one. i only felt sorry for linda blair, who apparently haven't been let to try any other than that good old possessed girl / woman role ever in his career, or so it looks like when checking out his filmography.well, folks - not much more to tell, and even less to tell home about. don't expect too much when spending some rainy afternoon with this, and probably you'll experience at least some mild fun. it also helps if your rotten little heart pounds in the beat of 80's euro gore horror. and speaking of hearts - every movie that has david hasselhoff getting skewered by a sizeable metal object and bleeding heavily around the room and corridors, must have it's one on the right place.this is my truth - what is yours?

i hated the first movie is really boring and we only get see the octopus at the end. the plot dead bodies are being found in the new york harbor. the police have no clues nor suspects until nick and his colleague realize the killer is a giant octopus. everybody, especially the police captain, refuses to believe nick's story, and soon the harbor will be filled with boats for the 4th of july celebrations...in this movie we get to see more of the giant octopus and special effects for this movie are really good for it's time.the acting is this movie not bad but not great too but okay and watch able. the are some really cheese scenes to movie but if can get past that, you should enjoy the rest of movie. 5/10

when i saw the first octopus movie it was a laugh see the cheesy acting and appalling effects. this film seemed to make up for the acting, but not the special effects. after jaws and piranha, sure, why not make a film about a killer octopus? the octopus invades the new york waters, where 2 police investigators try stopping the rampaging beast before the 4th of july.a pretty clean plot and descent happenings but the octopus was pretty much appalling, its nice to see they actually made it this time but it looked like a piece of plastic... better on a big budget really, this film could have been a good watch. there's a continuous amount of errors where it wouldn't surprise me if they didn't research the way octopus live...watch this if you like cheap dvd sequels, otherwise your better watching jaws.

during the summer, the cue line for this attraction is really long, since it is a water ride. it's very well-themed, but a lot of the ride's artifacts seem to be out of order. overall, the ride is not worth it if you have to wait for almost 2 hrs. in line. the drop at the end is exciting, but the whole ride itself could have been better. creators for indiana jones could have prob. helped these hollywood designers. also, many times the ride breaks down and causes even longer waiting periods for others. it's also very unpleasing when they only have one raft departing dock open and not the two, like they are supposed to. during halloween horror nights, you ride in the dark, and it's exciting if it's your first time, but if it's not, then don't bother waiting in a four-hour line.

the salena incident is by far the director, dustin rikert's, best film --- which isn't saying much. in his past films (and i use the term "films" loosely), the director takes ideas from hollywood blockbusters and severely marginalizes them. the salena incident is no different. the movie is basically con air meets aliens done with the semblance of your average film school production. the film is riddled with out-of-focus shots and plagued by special effects that would have trouble rivaling most high school computer animation classes. for example almost every on-screen explosion is the same fire effect matted over the screen.the weak effects and production value are only compromised by a flawed plot and rocky dialogue. in a sentence, the story strings together like an exposition of overused hollywood clichés. the movie begins with the worst cgi alien ship ever made crashing into the worst cgi earth ever made and a team of army somethings going down to investigate. next a bus of prison transports, carrying the worst of the worst from across the state, is overthrown by the prisoners with the help of their blonde girlfriends armed with silicon implants. the prisoners escape and run into the town of salena where they encounter the aliens who... shock... have escaped from an alien prison transport carrying the worst of the worst from across the galaxy. the prisoners, and their captive police armed with only guns and sad puns have to fight off the aliens and escape the town before the international space alliance *rolls eyes* bombs the city into oblivion.the only real enjoyable parts of the movie are when the actors (who are clearly undermined by the script) are given the freedom to improvise and also when they fight off the smaller of the alien creatures in a flurry of gun fire. other than that, the movie really isn't worth anyone's time let alone the plastic that the dvd is made out of. how awful was it? let's just say the secretary of defense is about 90 years old, works in a room that is about as high tech 1950's real estate office and is wearing a looney tunes tie. yes, if that wasn't clear enough before, the man in charge of the pentagon is wearing a tie with bugs bunny and the road runner on it. the movie basically culminates (hahahahhaaa did i say culminates...) with the last remaining soldier running into the group of prisoners and guards and the new formed team fighting their way away from the vicious aliens --- which for some strange reason leads them straight back to the alien ship? yeah...the movie has heart but is riddled with horrible direction and even worse camera work. someone seriously needed to slap the dp and tell him there is more to cinematography than repetitive, stagnant, chest-level shots. this movie really isn't worth renting (if it ever makes it that far) being that it's not as horribly bad as the last films made by the director which reduces the laugh-ability, but it's nowhere near watchable cinema.

i watched this film with a group of nazis, a french archaeologist and my ex-girlfriend on a small island in the mediterranian.when the tape was started, myself and my girlfriend were tied to a wooden stake at the far end of this cave like area. i told her to close her eyes and no matter what happened not to open them. the nazi's and the archaeologist didn't close their eyes and after a few seconds started screaming. the nazi's faces melted and the archaeologist's head exploded.after a few seconds the video tape popped out of the vcr and landed back in it's box and the top snapped shut. myself and my girlfriend were left unharmed.consequent to this experience, the video cassette was put in a wooden crate and stored in a huge warehouse of identical wooden crates, never to be see again.

an italian/american co-production co-starring linda blair and david 'the hoff' hasselhoff: how could any fan of trashy horror resist such a treat?well, based on the uneventful, extremely tedious, and utterly nonsensical first forty minutes or so, i would have said 'very easily'; thankfully, however, things do eventually get a tad more entertaining with the introduction of several inventive death scenes, and for those lucky enough to find an uncut copy, a smattering of nudity too (unfortunately, my copy was optically edited to remove such offensive material).the hoff stars as gary, a photographer who accompanies his beautiful girlfriend leslie (leslie cumming) to a run-down hotel on a seemingly deserted island in order to take pictures for her latest project, a book about witches; whilst there, frustrated gary also hopes to try and cure a bad case of blue balls by relieving leslie of her virginity.his plans for nookie are scuppered, however, by the unexpected arrival of property developers freddie and rose brooks (robert champagne and annie ross), their pregnant daughter jane (blair), son tommy (michael manchester), pretty nymphomaniac architect linda sullivan (catherine hickland), and estate agent jerry (rick farnsworth), who have come to inspect the island's hotel.after explaining their unexpected presence on the island, gary and leslie are welcomed by the property's new owners, and when a violent storm suddenly picks up, making it perilous to return to the mainland, everyone agrees to spend the night in the old building. unfortunately, unbeknownst to the hotel's new guests, the place is also home to the spirit of an evil witch (hildegard knef), who requires human sacrifices in order to bring herself back to life. one by one, victims are pulled into a swirling red vortex (which is guaranteed to provide unintentional laughs), before meeting a terrible fate.none of this makes much sense, and the acting is atrocious (manchester as tommy is particularly bad, whilst hasselhoff proves to be one of the better performers, which speaks volumes about the others), but those viewers who make it past the dreary first half are rewarded with some pretty decent moments of gore: rose has her lips sewn together, before being roasted alive in a fireplace; jerry is crucified and burnt alive; linda is tortured by hags and impaled on a swordfish(!!); freddie's veins pulsate and erupt in geysers of blood; and gary gets stabbed in the back.oh, and leslie is raped by a guy with no lips and blair gets possessed (again).

i bought this movie from a market stall three years ago.. i gotta hand it to you when i sat down and watched it.. i thought 'ok! this is gonna be another big action b-movie..' obviously i was wrong.. while watching this film.. i began to realise that this movie was taking me to another planet.. full of cr*p!i began to get really bored and fed up with this film.. although i wanted to see was gonna happen in the end.. i really felt like it was really getting on my nerves..the people behind the film may've brought some well known name actors into this project.. but what were they thinking..? even these actors couldn't save this film..at the end of the film.. i felt like this was a waste of money.. just buying this low life sucker of film for a small amount of money. a few months later, i sent the tape off to charity.. i didn't want to see it again..sorry! but if you're thinking of watching a movie and then nodding off to sleep.. i can highly recommend it you.. me? i'll rather go on pro-plus and watch something decent..!disappointing 1 out of 10!

for many years ed wood's classic 'plan 9' has been considered the worst film ever made. forget it the roller blade seven is infinitely worse. the cast is made up of famous peoples brothers and almost famous or has been actors and actresses. the plot along with the budget and script are non-existent. the running time is made up not in the classic ed wood style of using stock footage. instead there is endless slow motion and repeated action. and as for the roller blade seven aren't even seven of them!you must see this film just to know how bad film making can really be. giving independent film makers everywhere hope.

this has to be the greatest practical joke ever. i'm amazed that all the other actors kept a straight face. i might be wrong but the impression i get from this movie was that they duped frank stallone and joe estevez into acting in this movie that has a budget of just under $40, depending on how much those nerf bats and spray painted catcher's equipment cost, create the most incoherent movie ever created, and sit back and laugh at the fact that joe estevez and frank stallone weren't in on the joke. if by some chance they weren't kidding and they legitimately tried to make a real movie then i feel sorry for everyone involved in the creation. i've had quite a love affair with cheesy movies, but this movie is so bad i can hardly watch it. they repeat pointless "special effects" so many times that it's obvious they were just trying to cover up the fact that they only shot 30 minutes of footage. if i were forced to watch this movie on repeat i would bludgeon myself unconscious with my own hands after about one and a half times through. no offense to the great frank stallone, but i would rather watch sylvester teach a fingerpainting class for 10 hours than watch that movie ever again.

okay, let's cut to the chase - there's no way i can give this anything other then 1 out of 10; and yet you have to see it! the acting is bad, but is nothing like as bad as the script, which itself pales before the production values. cardboard axes? yup, we've got then. car floor mats painted silver and used as armour? here it is!the film itself pretends to be artistic, but is just cheap; the same shots are used repeatedly - especially in the drawn out fight scenes; there is (thankfully!) very little dialogue, and there is much 'artistic' music to ram home the horror!and yet all this awfulness is compelling - you have to watch it through just so that you can say you've seen it. i've not even got onto the barren sets, the 'plot', or the risible special effects; this really is the 'how not to do it' school of filmmaking. this must be viewed - spread the word, and let the world all join together in puzzling over what on earth is happening at the endthe best thing, though, is that they made a sequel.

it was (foolishly) with some degree of relish that i sat down to watch what a friend had promised would be the worst/best movie experience of my life, the mighty 'roller blade 7'. 2 years on and i'm still in therapy. oh yes my dear friends it really is that bad. they obviously got about 40 minutes of footage in the can and then decided to use said footage endlessly and repeatedly to brain-numbing effect. my only fear of the kind of post-apocalyptic world featured in this turkey is that somehow, some way, a print of this abomination would survive. truly the living would envy the dead.

truly a great leap forward in the perfection of painful cinema.everything about this film is bad. acting (if it can be called that), lighting, sound, script (if there was one), editing, direction, camera work, it is all atrocious. there is not a single element that is done well. if i thought that this was intentional then i might give the film some credit but i can not believe people would set out to make such a horendous film.this film is worth buying and screening to your worst enemies.

in reality that happened: the royal mother in law and father in law lunched with the couple the day after the wedding and gave her the money in public. this troubled young elisabeth so much that she never forgot the issue. we must remember she was only 16. she was so embarrassed that she kept a fear for sex all her life. perhaps this began to appear as a trauma. also the constant meddling of her aunt and mother in law. as you say, she kept all her children away from her, critiqued her teeth and manners (which she considered inappropriate for an empress), and when sissi finally went to venice with her husband and children, her eldest daughter died, and the mother in law blamed her for that unfortunate and premature death. she never recovered.

the figure of empress elizabeth of austria (1837-1898) is, indeed, mostly associated with romy schneider and the sissi trilogy by ernst marischka (1950s) where beauty, gentleness, sweetness but also history are ever present. this was the sissi, perhaps myth for some; however, a powerful portrayal. the spirit of the habsburgs' grandeur as well as the spirit of the bavarian simplicity and straightforwardness influenced much those films. simply, they did have a soul. however, jean daniel verhaeghe's film, though made 50 years later, appears to be a wrong depiction of the empress and her life. it seems to be an attempt to show something different, to reveal some realism as a cure to sweetness; yet, it does not occur to add a lot but rather deprives the whole story of much. let me analyze that in more details.september 1898, sissi embarks at the port of geneva. accompanied by her court maid, she goes to visit dr mayer (didier bezace) whom she is going to tell the whole life story in order to find herself in this tragic life. the action consists of flashbacks to important moments in sissi's life, yet these moments are chaotically presented and, therefore, someone not very knowledgeable of austrian history may get totally misled or confused. much attention is drawn on sissi's bad marriage with the emperor franz josef. the scene of her wedding night is a failure. no one treated an empress like that (i mean undressing and payment). the focus on sissi being misunderstood is right historically, however, the points that her views differ from the rest of the courtiers' are not the true ones. where is her desire for peace? where is her love to her nation? where is her charity? sissi appears to be rather very elegant, modern, liberal (from the 21st century's point of view). she foremost cares for her looks which is not true historically. sissi had an inner life which is not showed in the film. "once women will wear trousers" is a sentence said by her and occurs to be the image of the sissi presented in the movie. sissi detests monarchy, which is the film's noticeable criticism towards austrian empire. moreover, she partly accepts anarchist movements and, to my very surprise, she blames her husband, emperor franz josef, for the death of rudolph, their son. where is any mention in history that sissi was present in mayerling? sissi's relation with sophie, the mother in law, is better shown, however the scene of sophie's death seems barely authentic and the conversation a bit of cliché.sorry to criticize so much but another crucial aspect of the movie which i find weak here are performances. although arielle dombasle has her moments as sissi, she generally does not suit to the role. she looks more like a "femme fa tale" than a tragic empress. her make up is seriously inaccurate as well as most of her gestures as the empress. malik zidi is a bit better as rudolph and may be regarded as the one raising the value of the performances, in general. yet, stephane audran does no special job as sophie: you simply don't get the impression of why she detests sissi. she did despise her for the sake of sissi's young age while crowned, for the sake of her behavior, lifestyle and her believes. partly it appears in the movie but definitely that is not enough. but the greatest mistake is, i think, julien hans capua as andrassi. andrassi was a count with pride, honor, patriotism...here, he appears to be a sort of libertine thinking only to make love to his queen. and the portrayal is so weak that this performance is very very pale. the accurate choice is tatyana ivanova as catherine schratt, she really fits to the role with her looks and her gestures. but, unfortunately, her role does not require much time on screen.a good point of this movie are some costumes and pretty authentic locations. the port of geneva is well presented and the moment of sissi's death occurs to be a good surprise from the movie. it does not appear to be how it really was; however, the moment is good from the symbolical perspective...the empress walks and knows nothing that this is her final moment. that is how she must have felt about it, that is how one insane man destroyed a part of greatness of the world. another good moment visually was when sissi talks to her son rudolph on corfu. but these moments are rare.in sum, it's not a good film. it distorts a very eminent historical figure, a significant historical time, it tries to cure the sweetness of sissi trilogy but appears to offer nothing creative. charm is gone, grandeur is gone and history is ignored! not very worth seeking out! 3/10

this was a movie that could have been great if there were not so many unnecessary historical inaccuracies and if the actors had been chosen or made up to look a little more like the real persons (not very difficult). sissi did not go to mayerling to see her dead son, she also did not die in the street; they carried her on to the boat and then back to the hotel, which was much more dramatic. i am not sure about the wedding night, but i find it exaggerated that a lady-in-waiting would undress the empress and leave her completely naked (and that in the 1850's) or that the emperor would announce very proudly "yes i finally laid her" to the assembled court. as far as i know this was done right away on the first night and nobody rewarded her as if she were a streetwalker. the saving grace of the movie is really stephane audran, excellent actress and true to character.

this film was bad. i believe elton (or is it mike) wong starred in it. anyway it was the wong that didn't have that goofy grin and looks meaner. he plays a man who is hit over the head and suffers brain damage. he recovers and gets revenge. gordon liu is the only one worth seeing in this film, but he doesn't get to do much. but what little he does seems to make theothers pale in comparison. also, the film has some cheesy rubber hawk that the wong guy controls. this film is not worth renting or buying.

well i'd have to say that i do own this film and i only like the ending. the movie is boring and slow but the final fight is so funny. lets just say that if the fake bird didn't attack the main evil guy this movie would be a 0 out of 10. the bird though makes it a 3. if you are truly bored or want something terrible to watch rent this and fast forward to the final battle.

the credits at the end read "all directed by shigeru izumiya". that's a fitting way to phrase it because it seems like filmed material from several projects were thrown together somehow, barely even attempting to make it all form one consistent work. it more felt like one of those music clip things that are marketed as feature films to cash in on those video commercials, just that here we have the marketable music and the live performances missing, except for one scene, which may as well be marketed as a weird music video clip in japan. whatever.it makes zero sense. visually it isn't too special either, although it has its moments (for example the female creature with the "death powder" who is strapped onto a bed base and some morphing sh!t throughout) and it certainly has an industrial-y feeling to it. usually i'd call the effects dilettantish but what this film offers in this regard is baffling more than anything else. you remember those cheap video effects from 70's and 80's music videos that make them look so dated, like a picture within a picture flying through the screen? there is quite a lot of these kind of effects in this, and without any apparent reason. the most half-assed seeming effort comes in the form of a picture collage. the pictures sort of look like album covers. whatever.i don't know what's up with the subtitles of the version i saw. the chinese ones (or whatever those hieroglyphics are) sometimes seem to show up when nothing is even said and the english ones often show up without the chinese ones. the english subs talk much about life without death (is it possible?), and a mind without a body, which provides what comes closest to a comprehensible conflict between characters in this film. one guy (a scientist dude) says that life without flesh is death while another guy (a metamorphosing dude) who claims his mind is beyond his body now that he got the "death powder" blown into his face and that he now knows the secrets of the flesh and whatnot; metamorphosing dude is visibly p!ssed off about the scientist dude's claim. whatever.erm, the end - all written by perception de ambiguity

'gross misconduct' was one of a series of texts released in australia during the early-to-mid 1990s that explored the supposed victimisation of the privileged heterosexual male in the age of feminism. this creature only needs look at a pretty young thing, and he's accused of sexual harassment, and his life is ruined. damn those women's libbers! grrr...as my tone might suggest, i don't buy any of this anti-feminist bs, and correspondingly didn't enjoy this film. 'gm' trivialises the issues of sexual harassment and teacher-student relations. sexual harassment is here the product of a confused young woman's imagination, and those professional boundaries that teachers are meant to maintain ... well, when the teacher is a charming and handsome family man (and played by jimmy smits!), well needn't worry about those.sexist trash, and even by reviewing it, i'm giving it more time than it deserves.

university professor justin thorne (jimmy smits) has got it made. a good-looking, sophisticated teacher, with a loving wife and two adorable children. he plays the saxophone, owns an expensive car and his students love and respect him. but when temptation calls, in the form of one of his bright, pretty, sexy and willing students, jennifer carter (naomi watts), he foolishly gives in. the next day, he is being charged with her rape, and his perfect life could be forever ruined.when we see an american actor in australian film, we know we are not in for a masterpiece. but even viewed with low expectations, "gross misconduct" is a huge flop. based on a play with a rather unimaginative title and then adapted into a reasonably enjoyable book, it fails to engage, convince or even remotely interest its audience on a most fundamental level. the script is awkward and unconvincing; the acting is, for most part, not much better. watts gives an acceptable performance, demonstrating for one of the first times on screen her emotion rawness, but she is the only good thing about the film, which seems almost like even it can't wait to be over.the direction is not horrible or distracting in anyway, but it is just painfully mediocre. apart from the afore-mentioned naomi watts, who could be forgiven, seeing as this was early in her career, the acting is wooden and gets steadily worse over the course of the movie. the usually reliable jimmy smits doesn't seem to have been trying in this one, and who could really blame him? all these small failures, however, only add to the film's ultimate fatal flaw, which is that the focus is entirely in the wrong place. any empathy for the characters or interest in the outcome is lost in a sea of what is basically soft-core entertainment of an adult kind. by the end, audiences will probably be bored, tired and wishing they'd done something else with their ninety minutes. unless you just want to see naomi get naked 4 or 5 times, you could definitely afford to give this nonevent film a miss.

a tedious mixture of puerile efforts at humour with romantic relationship melodrama fails to provide this weakly made film with any flavour of reality. as action opens, reno (a.j. buckley) enters his apartment, there discovering his girlfriend in flagrante delicto with his roommate, who gloatingly tells reno "well, at least it's with someone you know", resulting in reno's decision to never have another roommate, this decision told to viewers by means of a soon abandoned voice-over. the storyline then proceeds ten months where we find that reno is indeed true to his word concerning avoidance of roommates, although this appears to beg the question due to his garnering of a live-in lover, holly (holly fields), with whom he has generated marital plans. the plot briefly shifts to a sleazy hollywood strip club, wherein reno's uncle charley, enamoured of a "dancer" whom he finds eminently desirable, keels over dead atop the club's bar after seeing the unadorned charms displayed by the object of his affections. it is apparent that charley had been aware of the flawed condition of his heart, because he created a video tape during which his commentary bequeaths his large (and mortgaged) residence in hollywood to reno, and we see the latter deciding to, contrary to his vow, interview applicants for two roommates as tenants, with he and holly sharing the selection process in an organized manner. following an inane sequence involving bizarre renter candidates, all of whom reno and holly unsurprisingly find unsuitable for living along with them in their house they, unknown to each other, each select a renter of the opposite sex, with the lovers manifestly cool toward the choice of their partner. the newcomers (chad and nicole) would seem to have little discernible point to their existence other than highly aural fornication with a broad range of partners, and it is not long before jealousy mars the harmonic relationship of reno and holly. reno is bent upon patenting and merchandising a type of sporting travel bag and, as he has given an engagement ring to holly, the potential success of this entrepreneurial adventure is of great financial significance if he intends to advance his marital plan. unfortunately, the rapacious team of chad and nicole, whose every action is ostensibly laced with lust, is likely to disrupt any future wedding intentions of reno. direction is slack, plainly far from fulfilling basic needs of the players, although an erratically composed script provides scant material with which actors may work, and ad libbing falls embarrassingly flat. as a result, the performances are undistinguished, not aided by spotty editing, while the manner of camera-work changes as abruptly and often as a firefly's tail light. filmed with a low budget and on location, only a modicum of skill is required for the designing processes, but a larger measure of value might have been placed upon the tasteless d.j. background soundtrack, generally blaring and nearly always invasive. a good deal of discussion has been stimulated by the movie's final sequences that are apparently not expected by a viewer based upon what has come before, but in reality these comprise probably the only thoughtful portions of a poorly cobbled screenplay, and bids fair to make the work almost watchable, despite the shabby quality of the production as a whole.

this is a typical college comedy and its very average. the story is ok but not very entertaining. its about a unlucky guy named reno who looses his job, gets his car ripped off and then his uncle dies in a stripbar. his got a girlfriend though (a nice one btw. :-). anyway this uncle gives him his mansion in la and mercedes as heritage and soon reno and his girlfriend moves to la to this new house. the problem is that they would need some roommates in order to pay the high rent for this house and so the film unfolds... the movie starts ok and has a few funny jokes here and there, but the suddenly the movie takes a turn straight down to hell... the ending is bad. really bad. it destroys everything about the movie. you will know what i'm talking about when you see the movie...2/10

oh boy.. this movie is so mediocre i don't really know what exactly to write about it. i think it's easier to write what it's not: it's not very entertaining. it's not original. and there's not one character in the whole movie i cared about.kind of reminds me of a certain reality tv show on mtv, but without any interesting people. it just drags on and on and i could hardly wait for it to end. the only thing that kept me from switching it off was jennifer lyons (c:i thought a long time about this movie to find one good thing to say about it. what i liked was the reminder not to judge a person by the first impression you get (as holly did when she accused nicole) which earns it a score of 2 out of 10 instead of a 1.

roomies is the story of a guy who loses everything except his incredible girlfriend and an idea for a corn dog that he plans to patent and sell. immediately his uncle dies and leaves him a house and a car, and he gets some roommates in to help pay the rent and gets a job. then his girlfriend gets drunk and cheats on him, so he goes and writes a book about roommates and becomes famous.88 minutes. none of these details of the plot are explored in any detail, what you read above is more or less as interesting as the film will be. when his uncle dies there are some breasts on screen, one of the potential roommates he interviews is pretty funny for about 40 seconds. the ending is literally the worst i've ever seen. i want the other 87 minutes of my life back!i hadn't thought anyone could make a movie with so little merit: surely there are rules against this sort of thing getting to the public? the script can't be longer than twenty pages, and the budget must have been minuscule because the whole film has about 3 locations and a car. the only conceivable use for roomies, in my opinion, is if you're holding someone hostage and want to frustrate them beyond human thought. if so, get it on repeat and you'll have a ready made gibbering wreck within the day.one-and-a-half out of 10

i had high hopes for this one after reading the back of the dvd, "in the spirit of american pie and animal house..." after suffering through this i realized i just blew $2.50 to rent it. this movie started out slow and just got slower... brief and fleeting moments of levity proved that it was in the spirit of american pie if you mean "spirit" as a dead thing. not very entertaining or fun! don't be fooled like i was and expect anything barely watchable because this movie will depress you more than entertain you. "need to fill up three more lines for this stupid movie that doesn't deserve the effort... what a stupid piece of ignorant crud. this movie wreaked, even the brief nudity sucked!

i saw this movie on video with a couple of friends as part of a teen comedy triple header, alongside dorm daze and going greek. obviously we weren't going for quality, but for air-headed entertainment and gross-out gags. generally we got what we came for, but wild roomies really stood out: for being awful.first impression first, the cover: the norwegian release cover showed breasts covered up and a bunch of seemingly "crazy" roomies in the background; brings up pictures of drunken semi-naked teenagers doing bunches of funny stuff stuff doesn't it?- the "crazy" roomies on the cover were not even featured in the picture. and the funny stuff you assume they'll be doing?- absent as well.this movie was labeled comedy, which is a bit strange since it not even remotely funny. relationship drama would be more accurate.put shortly the movie is about a young couple inheriting a swanky house in la, and are forced to get some roomies to make ends meet. these roommates eventually put both the young couple's patience and relationship to the test because they're so "wild". problem is, they're not. and here lies the problem of this movie: the protagonist couple are so anal-retentive and neurotic that they manage to generate zero sympathy. you'll find yourself rooting for the antagonist roomies halfway through the movie. add mediocre acting, lame dialogue and boring direction and you got yourself a movie that is best left unseen.see something else.

this film makes about as much sense as an 'ozzie & harriet' or a 'father knows best' episode. an old copy of reader's digest (circa 1962) would provide more insight into modern life, or the relationship between a father and a daughter, than this weird concoction.i was surprised with diane keaton. she appears to sleepwalk through the film. (given the film's title, i realize that hers was a supporting role but even martin short managed a distinct, supporting character.)i can understand the attraction of an imaginary world created in a good romantic comedy. but this film is the prozac version of an imaginary world. i'm frightened to consider that anyone could enjoy it even as pure fantasy.

diane keaton is a pathetic actress. she is so boring and phony. she is the same on and off screen. i saw her in an interview with ellen degeneres and she behaves exactly the same as she does in movies. her foolish facial expressions make me want to change channels. she has been in a couple of good movies, but they would have been better had someone else been picked for the part. steve martin doesn't add much to the movie either. he over acts as well and also ruins an old favorite. the ridiculous part martin short plays only adds more idiocies to the movie. i've tried to watch the movie twice but both times had to turn it off.

i like kevin bacon and cathy moriarty, and i love mary stuart masterson, but the movie wasn't good at all. there wasn't a likable character in the picture, and the plot was nearly non-existent.ms. masterson is a great actress, but she just didn't pull off the "tough girl" character. (she had similar problems with her character in the second day of christmas.) perhaps she should avoid these characters, especially those with an obnoxious female child to play off of.evan rachel wood was unimpressive. her character was a brat, plain and simple, and no young actress could have given harriet any positive feelings.in the interest of full disclosure, i couldn't even finish watching this picture. forty-five minutes of my time is enough to waste.

i tried to love this movie. i really did. kevin bacon plays a cerebral palsy victim who is befriended by a 10-year-old girl whose fantasies of digging to china, flying away in a balloon, and so on, are her way of coping with a dreary existence. i admit i did fast-forward through one of the scenes in which the two of them share friendship and simple pleasures while soulful piano music plays in the background. okay, three or four of those type scenes. maybe nine or ten. okay, okay, it was fourteen. but i did sit and watch most of them.

again such kind of zero-budget digital-video cam trash. and again i fell into this trap cuz the title had "zombie" in it (german title: zombie attack!) the story: on halloween some people visit the "museum of the dead", it's a trap, a crazy doctor wants to kill the people, everything connected to some aztec-cult. so they fight against some zombies in there.ultra cheap scenery: some corridors with black tape on it. a few dilettantish drawings and a few skulls as you can find them in every fun-shop. no actors, just low-grade models waking around with absolutely no idea what to do. no effects. laughable make-up, your local hobby-make-up-zombie-fan will do it better, some time it looked as if they had not enough money for enough colour, otherwise they just could not do it like this, man, they have to realize the looks of their "zombies". some laughable martial-arts fights with the zombies, slow-motion. just, when the director wants to have it scary he uses some standard digital-video-cam effect where everything is flackering. unbelievable! 0 out of 10!

a study in bad. bad direction, bad acting, bad writing and f/x that´ll teach you that you´d better upgrade your computer before filming. it´s the kind of flick you used to do totally drunk in your cellar with dad´s camera when you were young at heart. but you certainly would not show it in public when you´re sober again, would you? you wouldn´t even view it. avoid at all costs.

this movie is so daring it doesn't attempt to hide its similarities to the shining. it lacks the originality to do so. and when it does, near the end, try to cover up its story of "father goes psycho under influence of sketchy haunted house in a foreign place," it does so by stooping to plenty of other already established conventions and ideas. in other words, it reduces itself to mere cliche. but hell, even i enjoy a good predictable horror or thriller as long as there is an interesting story, one filled with violence and gore, somewhere before the film makes the dreadful turn towards the predictable and trite. well, this film doesn't have a good story and i was really disappointed with it. what 'darkness' has going for it is remarkable direction and cinematography. it is a film well-shot and carefully constructed full of fun, creepy angles and shots. what 'darkness' doesn't have going for it is pretty much everything else. to begin with a minor quibble - the editing in this movie is obnoxious. it jumps from one scene to the next, sometimes pointlessly. for example, the old man in the movie (who pretty much carries the background story, later filled in by another character) is underscored by a hamster running circles. i mean, it looks cool the first time, but why continue to use the same image? i guess you'd have to see it for yourself, to understand what i mean. another problem with this movie is anna paquin's character who essentially whines throughout the film, crying and caring all too much about everything - she's the film's failed attempt at a character-driven horror film. the movie has scenes of overblown sentimentalism and the family drama it depicts is simply not believable. by the end, 'darkness' is a muddled melodrama, with a non-involving mystery provided with too simple of an ending. and it's hardly scary.

an american family moves to the countryside of spain to live in an isolated house. regina (anna paquin), the teenager daughter of mark (iain glen), who is sick and has some mental problems, and the nurse maria (lena olin), notes that weird things is happening in the house and with her young brother paul (stephan enquist), but her mother does not believe on her. reggie decides to investigate with her boyfriend carlos (fele martínez) the origins of the house, and they find that forty years ago, the place was the stage of the death of six children. reggie decides to ask for support to her grandfather albert (giancarlo giannini) to protect her brother against the house and her father.i bought this dvd expecting to see a good horror movie of haunted house mainly because of the names of anna paquin, lena olin, fele martínez (from "thesis" and "abre los ojos") and giancarlo giannini. further, i like very much spanish cinema. in spite of, i found a terrible screenplay, an awful direction and a deplorable acting of excellent actors and actresses. the intention of the story is good, slightly recalling "the shinning" in some moments, but unfortunately it is badly developed, never being clear, for example, the reasons and motives why the american family moved to spain or the horrible relationship between the members of the family, mainly the situation between maria and reggie. the direction is confused, poorly trying to use dark and shadows to give scary effects to the story. i love anna paquin, but her expressionless face never works in this flick. lena olin is a caricature of the great actress she is; and stephan enquist is too much weak for such important role. only fele martínez has a good performance in his support character. i liked the open end of the story. my vote is four.title (brazil): "a sétima vítima" ("the seventh victim")

when you get ahead of a film, you know you are wasting your time watching the movie in question. that is exactly how i felt while i was watching "darkness." i could see anticipate every twist and turn easily. it is a combination of "the amityville horror" and a myriad of films that deal with the occult. it is so silly that i almost found endearing its naiveness. i cannot say i was wholly bored but i found the film way too derivative for my taste. director balagueró tries to redo his early spanish hit "the nameless," but he cannot pull it off. i admit, a few sequences were creepy enough but i just abhor when i can figure out what is going to happen next. also, i hated to see good actors like lena olin and giancarlo giannini sweat so much over this piece of dreck. finally, anna paquin as the star of a horror film? this must be a joke. she is cute but she is one of those good child actors that have become a very monotonous adult actor. you can live without watching this one.

if you saw the grudge, a another mediocre ghost movie then you should know what to expect, just worse, a lot worse. this time instead of being in japan with all english speaking people we are in spain with all english speaking people. it is interesting that not one shot of this movie actually looks like spain and could have been entirely filmed in a studio back lot. oh and a place with swings, cause there's a good 5 mins of footage of swings with no one on them, oooohhh how spooky.this one is terrible in every way imaginable. the acting by the lameinator mom and dad don't help matters at all. anna paquin is the only person that delivers a decent performance in the film but i hate anna paquin so you can imagine my own private hell viewing this film.there is one good moment in the movie, however, when a villain is trying to explain the convoluted plot to anna paquin's character and she doesn't understand any of it and asks a bunch of stupid questions and he blurts out "you idiot, you have not understood anything!" lol. well i happen to understand this film is a piece of garbage. 0 stars.

horrendously acted and completely laughable haunted-house horror flick that has an out of place anna paquin playing a neurotic teenager fighting off the "things-that-go-bump-in-the-dark" that are plaguing her and her family shortly after moving to their new home in spain(?!). little more than a geographically re-planted rip-off of "the shining" and most notably "the others", the weak-plotted "darkness" is basically your typical run-of-the mill b-horror feature with a few predictable lame scares that can be seen by audiences a mile off (so to speak)! in retrospect i suppose i shouldn't have set my personal expectations quite as high for this movie to actually be good considering the well-known fact that it was shelved for nearly three years before finally being released around christmas of last year in american cinemas across the country to what was ultimately lukewarm ticket-sales and very harsh reviews from critics. when will filmmakers ever learn that there's more to making movies (be it horror or otherwise) than just the fey possibility of a little financial gain? (turkey-zero stars)

this review contains spoilers. i didn't have any expectations about this movie. i pulled it off the video store rack with the movie, "white noise".first, the credits for this stupid movie run about 5 minutes into it. the pacing from start to finish is slooooow. the main heroines don't like to wear a bra and the director appears to enjoy the jiggle effect as anna paquin descends the stairs. if you like movies for boobies, this one has a low level buzz factor.second, it's nice that the movie rips off elements of lovecraft and other horror genre mechanisms, but in better movies, there is at least some rational or consistently irrational behavior. this stinker tries to establish some sense of modernity and reality but then you have situations where no one calls the police even though they've uncovered a treasure trove of potentially incriminating forensic evidence, and otherworldly rituals are nicely spelled out in a comprehensive book on otherworldly rituals like on buffy. i was waiting for miles to show up and give some consultation on how to slay a certain demon type of so and so.the premise is that it is possible to open up an age of darkness where creatures that crawl on the ceiling can cut your throat or turn the meat grinder effect on you. ho hum. to do this you need to have a sacrificial circle and then have seven kids who must have their throat cuts by people who love them. this opens the world to the age of darkness. at least that's what it says in complete detail in the book of ancient occult rituals. which raises the annoying question of, uh, well, how did the ones who wrote the book know, and, if this is what happens, would you really leave this information in a book you can take out from the library, much less get it from a library in a world that is not covered already in darkness, an age brought on by lunatics who could have performed this like much earlier using the "occult practices to bring the world to darkness for dummies, 2nd edition"? it turns out the father in the story is the 7th child, the one that ran away from the ritual 40 years ago; he was released by his father, who is the doctor/grandfather in the movie, who wanted to try the ritual with presumably, other stupid parents, who just wanted to see if dumb sh*t like this opening the world to darkness actually works. the grandpa let the father go because he "didn't really love him". aduh. stupid stupid movie written by a moronic director who appears to think he's some kind of eurofilm auteur. there's also a scene in the movie where the kid appears with big welts on his face and the mother grabs him and has this total lack of reaction. the whole movie is like this. people seeing really weird sh*t going on and not reacting to it in any sort of normal way. must be bad plot and direction.anna paquin does her best to play her character realistically without cracking a smirk, and she does look smashing in a halter top, but at several critical moments in the story, her character doesn't bother to call in for back up. you know, more of the same, "i will walk into a likely demonic evil situation without any knowledge of defense or help from others carrying flashlights or firepower even though i sense impending doom." and even dumber as it may seem, even if you bring on the age of darkness, these creatures who make you bloody can't attack if you have a light source, but they appear as people you know, and tell you to turn off the light source. reminds me of the video game "alone in the dark"; maybe this movie is a rip off of that game's concept.the best actors in the film are the young kid and anna. they both die at the end. the entire family dies. the darkness creatures lead them to their death, but really, the stupidity of the characters in the family was the main cause of death. the other adults could be interchangeable with any other actors from the red shoes diaries series of fine cinema.so to wrap up, the worst things about this movie are the stupidity of the characters in bumping around blindly in an obviously abnormal situation, the really crap plot (there is an old architect in the story who designs a house with a sacrificial altar hidden in it - the architect has suspected from the beginning there would be occult sacrifices in the house but doesn't tell anyone because, well, no real reason, they couldn't find the kids, but he didn't bother to tell authorities about the hidden rooms which he designed into the house but he does like to hang around the house for a 40 year period because he worries about what is going on inside...derrrrh...duuuuh), the hackneyed use of scare mechanisms (more children standing around in the dark or only showing up in photographs, and blood on the wallpaper), and the egotism of the director which when you see him in the dvd features describing his crap work as a new and original rendition, makes you understand where the real horror of this movie lies.is it entertaining? at 2x speed on a dvd player with the subtitles turned on, it can be entertaining, until your reach the end and realize the movie is crap, otherwise it draaaaaaaags on. the cinematic equivalent of a fatty shake; the empty calories are horrid.the movie gives the feeling the director must have seen "the ring" and wanted to attempt to create something similar in mood, which in this respect, the film fails miserably, and so, also, in this respect, jaume balagueró, it is my opinion that you suck at what you do.

what starts out as a passable movie degenerates into one of the most incoherent, unscary, incompetently made, stupid attempted horror films of recent years.absolutely terrible. it's such a derivative mess ripping off every decent fright flick you can think of without successfully producing a single scare. whether it's copying the recent trend with creepy kids or ghosts walking past the camera or the old school horror of fulci's gates of hell.the worst thing is there's not even a cat jumping out of a cupboard to make you jump. to be avoided.

as a canadian history major, my first thing to say : historical facts are not accurate! how can a producer do that? the deportation of the acadian wasn't in 1759 when we see franklin in london, but in 1755! how can he pass that in the movie? the scenes in londo were useless too. then for the story for anyone that read "les anciens canadians", you have the story line right there. it's the story of la coriveau, that "witch". add a love story too and a tragic relationship between mother and daughter ending. sure, it brought tears to my eyes. but that's it. then there's the fact it's apparently set up in québec city, but it's mostly shot at the forteresse de louisbourg. sure it's a historical site and it's accurate to the time, but it was obvious that the scenes were not all set in québec city. overall, if you're looking for a documentary of new france, go get candad : a people's history, a real documentary on the history of canda and new france. if you want a love story that will bring you tears, a story set up in a wonderful forest, watch new france.

the actors were not believable, the story was really weak, total sap, and completely predictable. really disappointed in depardieu. it was a shame that they did not focus more on the struggle of the canadian fight for independence. we have seen this love story many times before, only with better actors! we had to wait for the last 15 minutes for a small sense of drama! the soundtrack was totally disturbing. the underscore hit you over the head with sentimentality. but really over the top. the only thing we found ok was the fact that they let the indians speak their language. and we found the cinematography, of the indian village relatively realistic.

much can usually be forgiven in period pieces that ask us to recall important historical events and spice them with enough love interest to keep the story going. battle of the brave tackles the 18th century struggle for the control of quebec (an all of canada) between the british and the french with sidebars form the new america. it has the makings of a sweeping epic of fascination, but sadly in the hands of writer pierre billon (whose script deserves a razzie award for worst of the season) and the scattered, unfocused, and confusing direction by jean beaudin this film is a dud - a two and a quarter hour tedious mess of a film.even a cast a fine actors - pairing noémie godin-vigneau as marie-loup carignan with david la haye as françois le gardeur, adding the lovely bianca gervais as acoona , the venerable gérard depardieu as le curé thomas blondeau, and the likes of irène jacob, vincent perez (ridiculous in period wigs), tim roth as william pitt, colm meaney as benjamin franklin, and jason isaacs as général james wolfe - doesn't help. veteran actors such as these must have cringed at the crude lines written for their characters! cover the whole mess in a sappy musical score by patrick doyle and the result is a long film to be avoided. sad to say such bad things about a costly project, but be warned....grady harp

this was truly the most painful experience i have had in quite some time in a movie theater. i will forego such facile criticisms as 'maudlin' or 'historically inaccurate' or 'horse's crap's crap' because quite simply our sympathies would then immediately go out to these words. if a director's to make a sweeping grandiose love epic, well for god's sake make a real damn sweeping grandiose love epic! why bother with such laughably unconvincing second rate harlequin romances and such boring interchanges between characters we could care less about when the most decisive battle on canadian soil is taking place? and for the pompous people thinking 'oh well, this story must center characters!" well you're wrong, dead wrong.

from the second the music swelled (second one of the movie) and it was movie-hack tripe, i knew i was in for a very long ride. horrendously clichéd - (i laughed a lot and knew how the plot ended well before the ending) - they didn't use louisbourg particularly well and the costuming and hair were kinda awful. (my particular favourite makeup moment is that the only way they age depardieu as far as i could see was by putting a straight hair wig on him, instead of wavy). i could go on about the ridiculous unsuitability of the music for a long time -- the movie could be improved massively by an 18th century score. (eta: ah, it's that horrible moviemusic guy patrick doyle who's responsible for the score - say no more! he should not be allowed near historical movies -- he should stick to 20th century settings.) the "visit to the notable people portion" was also hilarious particularly his little visit to madame pompadour who was not particularly convincingly played. i thought the only actor who appeared grounded in the century at hand was michael maloney as james murray. he absolutely stole the show for all 30 seconds he was on screen. tragically, he made you see what the movie could have been.the love scenes did have some heat - the two leads were stunning together.the most awful scene for historians is where they're at the big leavetaking dinner in britain before wolfe sails and he lifts his glass and says the first two lines of "how stands the glass around" aka "why soldiers why" as if it's a toast. absolutely excruciating failure at historicity, much better to leave it out. thousands of people know the damn song and thousands more believe the rumour that wolfe and company sang it (probably drunk, not all stuffy like this bunch). daft.

from the title, the tag-line, the plot summary on the dvd etc..., i expected something at least slightly epic, with the historical fiction and the romance concurring to thrill you; that's what they did in last of the mohicans for example, and i think they did a superb job. maybe i had standards too high for this movie and didn't give it a fair chance. but the scenery was barely ok (how could they not come up with something more beautiful when they have such landscapes to work with?), the two lovers had no chemistry whatsoever, and the plot was just so predictable it felt like it had been drafted in 5 minutes by a twelve-year-old -- and not a very imaginative one. nouvelle-france is a love story set in an eventful historical age. but the history of nouvelle-france is hardly a side note, and the love story is banal and fails dramatically to make the viewer care for the lovers' fate. surprisingly, the only good parts about the movie came from something completely unexpected and unadvertised: the relationship between marie-loup, the heroine, and her children (one natural, one adopted). if only they'd concentrated on her family and forgotten about the love story, it would have been a much better movie. marie-loup's parents should have been given more screen time and character development, the politics going on in britain should have been more than a three-minute scene with barely any connection to the rest, the rotten baddie should have been either more developed or removed from the script completely (why hire actors like vincent perez, tim roth or jason isaacs to misuse them so badly?) bad work overall.

despite decades of tax incentives, in terms of international visibility the canadian film industry still lags behind most central african and islamic states (surprisingly few canadian films are released outside their native shores), and nouvelle-france aka battle of the brave is another example of why. more than any other country, commercial canadian cinema seems unable to develop an identity of its own and is stuck in pale imitation of other countries' failures. on paper this historical drama could look vaguely promising. there's certainly a rich vein of untapped material in canada's history as the french and english warred over and bought and sold the colony, though none of it makes the cut here unless you count the odd blink-and-you'll-miss-it scene of characters saying "wolfe is dead" or "nouvelle-france is no more" before getting back to the soap operatics. but while this isn't a history lesson, it isn't a drama or the epic adventure the new title promises either: there is no battle in the film unless you count 10 seconds of shelling by a half-dozen re-enactors and one collapsed shed. the town square that is all we ever see of quebec is a rather obvious flatly lit studio interior, giving many scenes an old tv miniseries look, as does director jean beaudin's reluctance to offer much in the way of long shots or even exteriors. what you do get for your money is a simple but drawn-out harlequin romance about doomed lovers constantly separated by events beyond their control where the biggest surprise is that fabio doesn't turn up in the cast. it's the kind of film where whenever two characters are about to make the beast with two backs the camera pans over to a convenient raging fireplace or waterfall.an anglo-canadian-french co-production that doesn't so much unite once-warring nations as throw any country with a decent tax break into the stew, this massive box-office disaster was clearly intended to be canada's titanic - though someone neglected to tell the producers they meant the film, not the ship - but turns out more like revolution done on the cheap without the battle scenes, crowds or the few moments that threaten to briefly work in the face of overwhelming odds. the montreal mirror described it as "so bad that one can't even find the strength to mock it." that's rather unfair, because while for most of its running time the film looks like a below-par 80s miniseries, the last half hour suddenly becomes very funny, with characters accidentally putting their legs in bear traps, dastardly husbands declaring "you'll never see your handsome lover again, cuckold's honor! you'll pay for this, both of you!" and our heroine accused of murder and - gasp! - witchcraft in a trial funny enough to have been in demi moore's version of the scarlet letter. throw in caddish british governors, devious slaves and celine dion singing at the end and you've got something that at times almost feels like the kind of film that timbo hines was aspiring to (and still managed to miss wildly) with his legendarily inept period version of war of the worlds, albeit without the staggering technical incompetence.leading man david la haye's versatility seems limited to the number of other actors he can look like throughout the course of the film: he starts out looking like andy garcia, briefly adopts the al pacino revolution look, flirts with the clean-shaven tchéky karyo style before turning into a younger ted danson as his character ages. while his opening scene where he reacts to news of his father's death with an expression that looks like he's waiting for the director to tell him he can go home now promises a feast of bad acting, in reality he gives the impression more of a mediocre supporting actor who's lucked into a lead at the last minute when whoever was originally cast finally read the script and bailed. he shows willing and gives it a go but the grace and charisma the part needs just isn't there. billie piper lookalike noemie godin-vigneau's leading lady doesn't exactly set the screen alight either despite occupying center-stage as the peasant girl who is the prey of giggly vincent perez's corrupt and perverted intendant le bigot (that really is the character's name), the duplicitous goateed drunken lackey sebastien huberdeau and, saddest of all, gerard depardieu's bedridden revolutionary dirty old priest in a manky grey-haired wig. it's a truly pitiful sight to see a once great actor at the absolute rock bottom of his game as he shuffles through the motions looking like he's not just lost the will to act but the will to live along with it. he clearly couldn't be bothered to stick around for the english dubbing sessions (or even a couple of long shots where he is very noticeably doubled). small wonder he talked of retiring around the time of the film's brief release.some brief comic relief is provided by jason isaacs in his default patriot mode who overplays wolfe of quebec rather like an asthmatic alf garnett/archie bunker played by timothy dalton on speed while tim roth's william pitt stands on the sidelines with the occasional bemused smile of one who's being put up in a rather nice hotel with excellent room service and plenty of days off, though like colm meaney's benjamin franklin they're both in the film for less than three minutes. (voltaire and madame pompadour pop their heads around the door for a couple of minutes as well but fail to make any impression, comic or otherwise.) the supporting actresses are generally better: juliette gosselin and bianca gervais as the heroine's real and adopted daughters and a strikingly beautiful irene jacob looking for all the world like a young fanny ardant are all refreshingly good and deserve much better.

it's really a shame to see so many talented people involved in what's happen to be a very waste of talents. the plot is cliché. the directing is too self conscious and the characters are almost caricatures. one of the most disappointing aspect of this film is gerard depardieu's performance in the english version (this movie was shot in french and english at the same time). although he is one of the best actor in the film, he gives the worst performance of them all. i must say that bianca gervais come very close though...on a more positive note i must say that the newcomer juliette gosselin gives an amazing performance in both version. unfortunately that the only good thing i remember about this film...by the way i must apologize for my not very good english...

a film about an interesting and sensitive period of history, filmed in beautiful surroundings, managed to present an appallingly trivial and clichéd production, grossly clumsy script, poor continuity, intrusive slushy music, sugary casting, and pallid acting. it was a toss up between the script and the acting as to which was worse. the script probably won - the historical background, backstory and character descriptions were spelt out in painful detail in the dialogue. .. actually words can't describe quite how bad this film is.in a pre-release screening there was a massive exodus from about thirty minutes in. at about an hour many of those who remained were laughing loudly. i should add i am a francophile, i am fascinated by canada, and love historical film. this really was a one off.

please, do not waste your time and money with this stinker of a turkey.this is an over-the-top melodramatic love story set against the background of new france (aka quebec in the 18th century). or is it an historical saga of new france with an epic romance thrown in? i don't know, and at this point i don't care anymore.there is a rich story to be told out there about the intrepid french adventurers, rogues and other assorted characters who settled canada and parts of the us. this is not it. the characters are total clichés, the story is overblown, breathless and devoid of any charm, and before long all the viewer wants to do is get the heck out of the theatre, have his or her head checked, and get hold of his or her anger at being taken in by the hype.this film was the biggest disappointment of my year in terms of cinema, especially since, as an historian and a french canadian or canadian of french descent (or whatever) i am a) a believer in the fact that the story of my people in this country has yet to be told as well as it could on film b) interested in this subject c) a film-lover who thinks cinema these days could do wonders with this grandiose and tragic story.as i said, do not waste your time with this frustrating bit of claptrap.

this is the one major problem with this film, along with a good deal of québecois' biggest movies: done in a pretentious way by pretentious people.it's really sad, but "big shots" movie makers (driving dodge stratus...) from this province believes they got the thruth, they know what the little people like.we're not a rich province, every time a big movie like this (30 millions?!!?) is made, it's cutting off a lot of others who won't see their movie made because of lack of governmental help. so it generates mediocrity; only movies from "friends of the family" are going to be made.i sound angry and i am. i went see nouvelle-france expecting a journey in the lives of my ancestors, but i found myself stuck in a pool of inconsistencies: french accent (we gotta please our cousins, so f*** our québecois' language)and lack of historical research is only a few. add a campy love story and the same music score playing again and again and dumb québecois' viewer is gonna open up and ask for more. i'm glad this pretentious piece of s*** didn't do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots... it's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained "movie business" of québec.rent cruising bar instead and have a real good time.ps: i'll never forgive them for ruining such an awesome title.

as anthony bourdain said... "i wanted to stick my head in a bucket of lye, pull my eyeballs out and jump off a cliff." this summarizes my feelings about this pathetic waste of human effort. artless, self- indulgent, thoughtless, and just bad. bad beyond comprehension. what else can i say? if you are unfortunate enough to be in an area where this piece of idiotic trash is playing, please, please have mercy on soul and avoid at all costs.

if you would have asked me 1 month ago how this movie was i probably would have left most of this out, but i am a fan and as any fan i visit the movies sites often well when super troopers came out i visited that site after the release on dvd and was hooked yea it's a difficult site to stay on, but the good ones normally are like good families they stick together. what a story this company/comedy troop has.begging people to come and see there movies on street corners,universities, anywhere they can and all for free and after all that to develop a great fan base after a few years they crap on it and decide to close down there website that helped them and was created for the fans, but the worst thing about it....they didn't tell any of them. they just decided that they are better than us they want new fans not the fans that helped them get where they are....you know the same fans they begged years ago. still the smart crew they are they released the best movie with super troopers and got everyones attention and thank god for that because after that they have sucked with everything else. good for you guys way to go mainstream, just remember when you realize your material isn't that good and you have no new fans left you are the ones who crapped the original ones away. fans make you who you are not the other way around. never burn your bridges

i rented this movie because the dvd cover made it look like it was going to be a ridiculous college comedy like van wilder or animal house. i took it to my friend house to watch for movie night. we ended up stopping it 15 minutes into the film, and watched copper mountain instead. i don't know if any of you have seen copper mountain, but it isn't great either. however, i would have to say that the alan thick jim carrey duo made it a more enjoyable watch.i later finished puddle cruiser. this movie was slow and the humor was forced. this movie reminded me of some stinkers that i saw in some of my earlier production classes in college. i was left wondering "was this the film that enabled broken lizard to make supertroopers?" also how could this movie suck so bad? supertroopers was good and club dread was decent. don't see this movie!

i found super troopers only mildly amusing at best (seemed like a glorified police academy ripoff to me), and i rented this movie in hopes of it being better. it wasn't.the writing is absolutely horrible and the pacing of this film is even worse. it doesn't feel like a whole lot happens in this film, or that it really gives us a reason to give a damn about any of the characters.the actor who plays felix is totally uninspired, though possibly due in part to the dialogue he had to work with. in short, this movie just went wrong in so many places.i get the impression that since films like clerks, independent filmmakers seem to think that they can make movies like this with long, rambling scenes of dialogue where characters are trying to be funny. but, where dialogue in clerks pushes the story forward, in this movie, it hopelessly weighs it down. films are supposed to have a decent balance of action and dialogue, and as tempting as it is for filmmakers to try to have tons of snappy, funny dialogue, it just doesn't always work. especially if they're not that good at writing dialogue. i hate to say it, but even "extreme heist" was more interesting than this movie- and that movie was so low-budget it was shot on video.

oh my gosh!!!! this was the first movie broken lizard made as a group (although it just recently came to video), and i have never been more disappointed in my entire life!!! i tell you what, if i had seen this movie before i saw super troopers (which by the way, is a kick a$$ movie!!!), i never ever would have watched it!! i had read several reviews online, as well as on the cover of the dvd, that raved it as being,"broken lizard's funniest movie ever!" now if they were referring to super troopers as being their funniest movie ever, i would agree nonstop, but not this one. talk about dry. it took the movie a good 45 minutes to even get going, and by then, i was so out of the mood to watch it, that it wasn't even worth it. maybe you gotta be high for it to really be funny? i dunno. i love these guys, i really do, but that movie is by far the worst one they've made. club dread was a pretty good movie, but this one, just wow. i'd highly recommend super troopers if you want a good laugh, but if you want more of a romance, drama, with a few funny spots, i'd say go with puddle cruiser. just my opinion though, everyone is entitled to their own! :)

talented screenwriter alvin sargent sadly cannot get any engaging ideas cooking in this artificial trifle about a wayward mother and her mature teenage daughter trying to make their lives work in los angeles despite mom's flighty behavior. apart from several good sequences, i didn't quite buy susan sarandon as a flake (she's too intrinsically smart and focused to be passed off as this devil-may-care lady), and her naturally grounded personality is a bad fit for the role of an irresponsible parent. natalie portman fares much better as her kid, and yet there's a creepy aloofness to her work (and some of her scenes, such as the one where she asks a boy to strip, are misguided and uncomfortable to watch). certainly not an incompetent piece, "anywhere but here" does have moments that work, but it isn't an embraceable film, nor has it proved to be an important one. ** from ****

this film is about a couple that decides to take a vacation to the everglades along with another couple and the family dog. when they first get there, they are not welcomed by the neighboring gas attendant that warms them to stay away from the cabin in which they are to spend the night at for the week. after pestering with the old man, three hillbillys also do not take kindly to their arrival as they approach their car and threaten them to leave. after asking some of the local dummies that can't speak or just don't want to answer, they finaly find the cabin. after they settle in, strange things happen to the visitors including discovering crap on their car, the man thats the head of this trip thats an idiot shoots the family dog thinking it was a killer clawing at the door and a series of deaths later on in the end. adding a church group did not make the story any better. then at the end, the idiot that survives the whole ordeal goes around the town carrying a shot gun. lame. thats what this movie is.

think of an extremely low-rent version of "heathers," and you've got "pep squad." that sums up the flick in a nutshell. i must give credit where credit's due, though. the film has a nice visual appeal to it. i liked the cinematography, i liked the wild color schemes, i liked the costume designs. but without good acting, a film has no redeeming value. i'd rather watch a film with little visual appeal, with good actors and sharp dialogue (i.e.: "the brothers mcmullen" or any edward burns film). the actors either recite their dialogue in monotones or scream it out like they're in a bad soap opera. this is why i don't badmouth most mainstream actors. let's face it, most actors who are mainstream are mainstream for a reason. if they're not "great" actors, they're at least competent. people badmouth leo dicaprio, but when was the last time you saw a movie where he recites the dialogue as if he's reading it off the page? it's a shame, because the director seems like he knows his stuff when it comes to mis en scene (sp). at the same time i can't totally praise steve balderson (the director). he did write the screenplay, which contains some horrible dialogue. he might be slightly racist too, since there's a black principal in the movie, who inhabits a culmination of african-american stereotypes.

skilled professionals live it up in an exotic and dangerous location. they get drunk every night. they smuggle opium. they drop pigs in parachutes. they fly under impossibly hazardous conditions. they dress weird and act weirder. they're iconoclastic, outrageous. they violate every rule of command and have contempt for their employers at the cia. they're irreplaceable.nope. it's not "only angels have wings" and it's not "m*a*s*h." it's an uneasy mixture of the two that unfortunately comes across as more silly than funny.it aims at shock, amusement, and education, but doesn't really achieve its goals.as far as its shock value is concerned, well, we're inured by now, aren't we? does it really shock anyone that a bunch of hard-living pilots flew secret missions in laos in the 1970s? no, it's not shocking. it's not even educational now, under our current circumstances, when it would be interesting to learn that some paramilitary excursion was not buried in a file labeled national interest, defense de toucher. that's okay. so we've been wised up a little and are no longer neither so shockable nor so dumb.the problem in this case is that the film depends on those very qualities for its power to amuse. without that, the film implodes. a group of shaggy drunken cia pilots are sitting around in a cat house, goosing the girls, shooting out the lights with a silenced pistol, killing lizards with same. asks newbie pilot robert downey, jr., "when you guys act like this does it mean there's something to celebrate?" replies another, guffawing, "no, it means it's night time." that might be funny if we expected renegade pilots to be as upright as the rest of us. if we don't, the gag, like the movie, falls flat.there are action scenes naturally. everything that can possibly happen in or to an airplane in flight happens in or to an airplane in flight. people fall out of them, baggage is thrown haphazardly out of their hatches, engines fail, they sustain damage from aaa, the are torn apart during crash landings, but we've seen most of this elsewhere, often done better.some might find this funnier than i did, and the acting is pretty good. robert downey jr. is especially effective as the straight man. check out the other comments and if they describe a film that you might find appealing, then by all means watch it. there might be some laughs in it that escaped me.

an obscure horror show filmed in the everglades. two couples stay overnight in a cabin after being made a little uneasy by the unfriendliness of the locals. who, or what, are the blood stalkers? after awhile they find out. watch for the character of the village idiot who clucks like a chicken, he certainly is weird.

after his success with a nightmare on elm street in 1984, director wes craven for some reason decided that his next project would be this tv movie. i'm not a big fan of this director on the whole; early exploitation flick the last house on the left as well as his modern slasher scream sit well with me, but the rest of his work is very hit and miss and i'd hesitate to call him the master that others have labelled him as. the main theme here is cryogenic freezing, although it's more a springboard for the plot rather than an important part of the movie. the main influence here is obviously the excellent 1974 zombie film deathdream and we focus on miles creighton; a businessman cryogenically frozen for ten years before an accident that means he has to be thawed out immediately. miles is a part of a project for people that are ill; they pay to be frozen in the hope that they will be revived in the future when their illnesses can cured. miles is successfully revived and it's seen as a miracle...but the person that wakes up is not the person who was frozen, as miles returns without a soul.this film could actually have been quite decent judging by the idea behind it, but instead we're given a plot that doesn't really have a lot to it and it has to be said that craven doesn't make the best out of the potential of the film. the 'soul' is the main focal point, but it would seem that not having a soul and simply having a murderous intent/no compassion are the same thing, which feels a bit unimaginative. the film was made for television so it's not particularly nasty and it's obvious that not a lot of money was spent on it as the whole production feels very cheap. michael beck never became a very popular actor and that isn't surprising judging by his performance here; while he is passable, he largely lacks charisma and is not formidable in the central role. the plot doesn't flow too badly but there's a real lack of suspense and/or tension and things slow down too much too often, which results in the film being rather boring on occasion. it all boils down to a predictable ending also. overall, i have to admit that i was not impressed at all by this film and as far as craven's filmography goes, chiller would have to go down with shocker, the scream sequels and the hills have eyes ii as a miss.

john sayles, what have you done?"silver city" had moments in which i could see the glimmering hope of a good story, well-drawn characters, thought provoking dialog. and then those moments would quickly be covered over by layers of poor writing, clumsy direction, and abysmal acting. i truly love almost all of john sayles' work, but "silver city" is ghastly.i got the feeling that sayles may have been working on the beginnings of a good story involving the illegal labor and industrial corruption plot lines, but then he got rushed and stuck the secondary plot line satirizing the bush administration onto it. the two stories don't really connect with each other, and the weaker elements of the political theme dominate the first 3/4 of the movie, causing me to lose patience with the whole affair.the other major flaw is danny huston's acting. his dialog in every scene is delivered with a gawping grin, regardless of its appropriateness to the mood. i hated this guy by the end of the film, having been reminded of every bad actor in every high school play i've ever seen. not having seen huston in anything else, i don't know whether to blame him or to blame sayles' direction of him more. regardless, he's the unfortunate focal point of a very unfortunate movie.right down to the last sledgehammer-subtle final scene i was disappointed by "silver city." sayles at his best, or heck, even sayles at mediocre, can be so very much better than this film. see any of his other works instead. this isn't even worth a rental.

when my parents rented this movie, i was expecting a very funny movie as randy quaid is very funny in comedy movies. however, this movie is not all that funny and it is somewhat boring too. you can see the surprise coming a mile away and it runs long for a movie that is supposedly only eighty one minutes long. so i can honestly say it is not a movie that is on my favorites list. it may work for some people, but it just did not work with me at all proving to be rather slow in the build-up with virtually nothing that amused me within the entire movie. randy quaid is wasted and the rest of the cast is a list of very bland actors and actresses. the premise of the movie had potential, as did the casting of quaid, but all of it just sputters and the inclusion of the horror element just seems very unnecessary. granted, the one dream sequence the kid had when he jumped on the bed and it suddenly became a whirlpool of blood was very nicely done and would have worked very well in a movie that was supposed to be pure horror, instead of one that lists comedy as its first genre.

very disturbing, but expertly crafted & scripted and intelligently directed with a good eye for color and detail. mary beth hurt, sandy dennis, and especially randy quaid are unusually good. the story centers around a young boy (bryan madorsky) wondering where all the leftovers they eat every night comes from. his parents (hurt, quaid) strange behavior causes the school psychiatrist (dennis) to get involved. it is a gruesome cannibal movie. but it's not bad. if you like hannibal, you'll love this. if you don't like parents, stay away from the film. just giving advice to cannibal lover and haters.rated r for strong adult themes and graphic violence.

i watched this film with a bunch of friends at a halloween party last night. i got to say that the sarcastic comments were never ending and i have to say that they were well deserved. though i felt that the directing was done well, the craziness in their dialogue is just a little too much cheese. i think i got about an hour into this before i even started to realize what it was the point was that they were trying to drive home. you catch on pretty quick that this whole family is pretty quirky and something is off about them, it's just a little too slow. this movie could easily have been about 45 minutes and been a lot better. the only thing that made it bearable was the two bottles of wine that i downed during the course of the flick. bring on the slasher films folks, because at least i know what to expect out of them. this was not my thing, too much dark humour, and the subject material of cannibalism was a bit explicit and gross. i have to say that randy quaid played the part as well as it could have been, and i will give him props for that as i normally see him as a drunken goofball or a washed out fighter pilot who likes to kill aliens.in conclusion i give this horror/comedy film a very generous 3 out of 10.

(may contain spoilers) this movie is the epitome of weirdness. i rented it hoping for a film so bad it would be funny. however, i still honestly can't decide if this film was intended to be scary or humorous. it combines the emotions in a rather disturbing way. apparently this is trying to be clever but in actual fact it isn't. for instance, when the knife comes out and tries to kill the teacher, it starts playing happy music. when we go to toxico, we have up-beat, quasi-mr. roger's neighborhood music. however, when the little kid's dreaming of falling in "blood" and when he finds the leg, these are clearly intended to be tense. so, watch this film, and decide for yourself. it is too weird to be described in words and for that i say, kudos."nose-dive... wow!"

the second woman is about the story of a mysterious man who lost his wife in an accident and now believes that someone wants to do him harm. a girl who likes him wants to help him but she is led to believe that his fears are caused by a mental illness...interesting plot, very good acting, but the result as a whole is poor in many ways. the story is too simplistic, or rather, presented in a simplistic way (even though there is a couple of interesting plot twists). for example, people say they love each other after only two meetings. i don't want to reveal anything else, but you 'll see what i mean if you watch the movie. "come on, it was the fifties!", you may think. yet i 've seen quite a few films from that era and i know that some don't seem so dated nowadays.something that disturbed me was that some scenes were shot pitch dark, making it almost impossible to watch what was going on. ok, it's a film-noir but this one is too noir at some points... :o)overall, the second woman is not a masterpiece of that era, but no trash either. watch it if you have nothing else to do...

this film isn't a little bad. it's not even kind of bad. it's horrid. you know you're in trouble when charo shows up in a film. she must have had the week off from "love boat." george kennedy, at least he's a gamer - he's in there trying. actually, he's all right. and it's good to see martha raye. jimmie walker's okay. there's slightly better acting than in airport '75 but what film doesn't have better acting than airport '75? one thing i liked about this film is that it had more going on than a lot of other disaster films plot-wise. at least they made an attempt at subplots. what really hurts this film is the special effects - ugh! not too special if you ask me. this is the kind of film that at 2am is truly, truly funny if you've been up having fun with your buddies and you're looking for something to laugh at.

this movie has more goofs than any other movie i have seen in my life. the special effects are damned terrible. for instance, near the end, when the concorde is falling after the cargo door tears off, the thing spins like a toy. the special effects of airport (1970) are way better than this crap. also, the force of a concorde opening up at altitude and speed would essentially turn the thing inside-out. (that is if it would even open at all) but the movie has its good points. mostly when it ends. that's also cheesy. e.g. the thing lands on a bank of loosely-packed snow, if it did that, it would splinter into a million pieces. overall, 2 out of 10. instant flop. great laugh flick.

actually there was nothing funny about this monstrosity at all!! this movie was a complete abomination. the absurdities in this movie almost made me want to vomit!! i think that the people responsible for this movie took advantage of their viewing audience. they took a relatively decent series of movies (i did say decent, not good!!) and totally trashed it by trying to put money in their pockets. the making of airplane! was a way for hollywood to make up for this crappy flick. the worst part about it is that either nobody in 1979 realized the asinine events of the movie (such as concorde's door popping off at some ungodly high altitude or patroni shooting a flair gun out the window at mach 2 to avoid a nuclear warhead!?!?!?....what were they thinking???)were totally unrealistic or they just didn't care! i think that it is the latter of the two. the writers and director of this "film", if you want to call it that, really tried to suck the airport dynasty dry with this crap!

ok, so my summary line is a cheap trick. but the movie is full of them and it gets absurdly praised, so...i caught this one on tv (uncut, as tv here shows all movies, that's for you americans who might say i didn't like it because i saw a cut tv version - fortunately that's only an us thing), and had no idea about what it was. i switched on, caught the last minutes of a show, and the movie began. within a minute, i was begging it was a comedy, given the particularly ridiculous clichéd beginning (yes, it's a bad movie-within-the-movie, i know, but what a way to try to keep the viewer interested! i don't even know why i didn't switch channels). and, yes, in fact the movie turned out to be a comedy, albeit an unintentional one.marina zudina is pretty enough, but gosh, what a dreadful performance! while casting a foreigner in the role is smart enough (she doesn't talk so bye bye language barrier), yet, sorry, marina baby, playing mute doesn't mean impersonating harpo marx. her acting is unintentionally funny in many moments, just look at her when she draws an x in the air while stalked by the killer. he wants to kill you, it's no time to play zorro. we get plenty of "running upstairs" stuff passing for tension, as in the worst slashers, and things like pulling a carpet and a bad guy shots the other. ugh! will hollywood ever learn? yet the best/worst pearl is having a guy electrocuted in a bathtub and... well, i have never seen anyone being electrocuted to death in a bathtub, but i'm sure you can't see the blue cartoon rays in real life, do you? and how about immediately trusting a mean-looking guy because he says he's a cop, and not asking him to show you his credentials? ok, so he turns out to be a real cop. but still, not asking for the badge makes no sense (plot-wise, we could always think the credentials might be phony or he might be a crooked cop. screen writing 101). and how about the big twist? don't tell me you didn't see that coming from 200 miles away...i feel sorry for poor old alec guinness and his useless stock footage cameo. now i think about this, what's the point in giving him a "mystery guest star" credit... in the end titles? the movie's over, there's no mystery anymore, and everybody and their brother have identified guinness (even non-movie buffs will recognize "the old guy from 'star wars'"). yet better off this way, so we can pretend it's not the late great actor.people keep comparing this to, of all people, hitchcock. i suppose it has to be john hitchcock the milkman, as the late sir alfred would feel embarrassed out of watching this, let alone making it. and this gets a 6.8/10???? it's bottom 100 material! but then, we're talking a rating system that allows 'the lord of the rings: the return of the king' to appear as the third best movie ever made (check top 100), so...2/10.

i found this movie really hard to sit through, my attention kept wandering off the tv. as far as romantic movies go..this one is the worst i've seen. don't bother with it.

assault on precinct 13 is the absolute dumbest film i've seen since charlie's angels 2. the shame lies in the fact that they had a good cast and a good premise to work with. spoilers ............................................................. i know they've said this movie is a remake descendant of rio bravo but did the writers of this film actually watch rio bravo? besides the fact that rio bravo is a western classic, the premise of the film was that the sheriff (john wayne) had to keep a prisoner accused of murder from being liberated by his brother and his gang. no one wants to liberate anyone in assault on precinct 13. they want everyone dead. so, my first question would have to be, why not just burn the whole place down from the start? why "assault" the place at all? i know the contrived plot turn was suppose to be clever and shocking but it didn't make sense and/or was presented properly. if the veteran cop was in on it from the start, why the need for this whole movie? if the veteran cop suddenly cut a deal at the back door during the siege, how did he even get the chance? as soon as he appeared at the door he would've been shot and they would've had their entry point. it's all just fubar. what part of any city can an all out war take place at a police precinct (complete with helicopters and massive explosions) but no one notices?? however, as soon as there's a fire they have to "leave before the fire department shows up"?????? how did they plan to cover up the chaos that was happening outside?? police issue bullets in the walls, bullet casings, footprints, equipment usage, and the fact that there were going to be no bodies of "bishop's men" to be found? how about those police snipers? how could they possibly miss so badly so often? i like the fact that when the two detainees tried to run, the snipers were foiled by two tiny mounds of snow. as if it's not possible to shoot a high powered riffle through a pile of snow. the set up was interesting although ridiculous but the movie just went off a cliff when they decided to kill that particular character with a bullet to the head for absolutely no reason at all. i know the makers of the film were going for shock but all they got was disgust at the cruelty and the anger of the audience. don't you think that part of the reason why this thing is bombing at the box office is the fact that word of mouth has everyone telling friends and family to stay away from this one? that particular scene has to be a big part of that word of mouth (that and the fact that every plot turn is dumber then dirt). the conclusion remains steadily stupid as the villain pauses to deliver an austin powers-like diatribe instead of killing the helpless people who he has finally captured. i know several people have mentioned the closing scenes that take place in the woods of detroit city (>snicker<) but why did ethan's character just wander off in to the woods in the first place? he doesn't even look to see if the suv with the secretary and his friend gets away? they just cut to him prowling slowly in the woods, pistol in hand. gack. i could go on but won't. all i can say is that you want to avoid this stupidity at all cost.

the original "assault on precinct 13" is gritty, witty, and - perhaps most importantly - short. this remake is mercilessly padded out and talky. worse yet, the african-american hero of the first movie is here replaced with handsome white boy ethan hawke, which makes this "assault" less progressive than the 1970s one. god, how i miss john carpenter and his improbable plot line and his weird sense of humor. i even miss his b-list actors, who are leagues better than hawke and company.i can't say i care for the new villains in this version - they stretch what little credibility the story ever had to the limit. the female characters are useless, the criminals are all generic hoods, and gabriel byrne gives another of his bored performances. the music's all wrong, too - it's bland action stuff that actually detracts from the tension. simply awful.

the opening scene keeps me from rating at absolute zero. i wish the entire movie was as gritty and real as the intro.in order to enjoy some movies, a lot can be forgiven,(hand guns with 60 shots, hero's with super human powers, all women are gorgeous and half naked) but puuuuleeese this "assault on my intelligence 13" is so far fetched that i'm surprised the cast showed up for a second day of filming.firstly, how did these guys get to be cops? based on stupidity i guess. how do the main female characters justify being half naked in the middle of winter in detroit or wherever the heck they are. as a matter of fact no character reacts to the elements whatsoever in this movie. no windows, no electricity(which miraculously returns unexplained)during the storm of the century and they are all comfy as bugs in a rug. what technology exists which disables all cell phones, radios, and brain function. this must be the same power which causes maria bella to walk from her disabled car knee deep in snow with no coat and hardly any dress.

s l o w, l o n g, d u l l. . .oh my god, dull. characters so annoying - you'll cringe every time you see jimy smits, or the guy that played tomtom from now on. they must have never rehearsed or reviewed the film in progress. mel gibson was absolutely wooden.this may not be the worst movie ever made, but that it went almost straight to video says it is darn close.

i rented this movie on 20 june 2001, and watched it for about 45 minutes. i concluded that watching a blank screen would be delightful by comparison. there was not a single person in the cast for whom i would have shed a tear if hell itself had opened up and swallowed the whole bunch of them.so, i e-mailed all of my friends and relatives warning them, and i am taking the time to urge everyone who may see this note to avoid this movie like the plague! i have seen some really bad movies in my time, but never one as bad as this.

pretty pictures with a cool sound track do not constitute a 'movie'. like all pop promos, mdh's pretentions are are outdone only by its' unjustifiable budget. one dollar spent on this aimless, purposeless dross was one dollar too many. stick to penning pop songs bono.

it's the one film i almost walked out of, and would have if my friends hadn't been in the movie theatre with me. normally, even if i don't like a film, i think it's still worth sitting through it to the end. that way, you can really claim to have given it every chance to redeem itself. but with the million dollar hotel, it was so dreadful i just badly wanted the experience to end as quickly as possible. i think i probably would not have been so sourly disappointed if this film had been made by a lesser director, one i didn't normally like so much. but coming from wenders, it was all the more shocking to behold. i know bono from u2, a good friend of wenders's, wrote the script to this abysmal film, and i wonder why wenders let him, as buddy-buddy as the two may have been. "stick to the day job, bono", is a sentence that easily springs to mind whilst viewing this mess. pretentious, disjointed, a mish-mash of every possible contemporary film stereotype, a naive and transparent attempt at coming across as kooky and daring, with the most irritating characters i have ever set eyes upon, especially the leads, jeremy davies, milla jovovich and mel gibson, none of whom i dislike normally. the happiest ending i could have wished for would have been for a nuclear bomb to be dropped on their collective heads so as to get it all over with as soon as possible. on a positive note, the first five minutes of the film are extremely good, with an extremely stirring soundtrack from u2. but the film's opening shots make the rest of the film (which takes a spectacular nose-dive from then on) all the more disappointing as they are a promise of cinematic quality that's just never delivered, not even close.

perhaps i'm just a simple person, but i prefer movies that somehow make me care about the people in them. i couldn't care less about anyone in this movie. this was supposed to be a comedy? maybe the humor was too subtle for me (all the way down to the nano-level). the thing about it is, it missed on so many things. there were characters that could have been funny, but they weren't. there were characters that you could have liked, but you didn't. for instance, the guy who thought the beatles ripped off his songs. there was so much potential there, but all he did was talk like a beatle and complain about how they ripped him off. haha. and the previous poster talked about the 'i am the walrus' scene like it was special. what? he played 'i am the walrus' on an old piano and sang out of tune. is there an inside joke there? it sure stank at face value. this movie has the feel to me of a movie people say they like because it sounds 'intellectual' or 'hip' to say you like it, that you get the whole metaphysical art/garbage message the artist is expressing. if you want to be entertained, stay away.

this movie just stunk. i know that some people will say that anybody who thinks it is no good "just doesn't get it." i like wenders in american friend and wings of desire. but this is utter dreck. the main character is so annoying that i couldn't care less what he does. he is, as has been said in another review bouncing around like a little annoying monkey. i just couldn't stand him or force myself to care. this is the case with most of the characters who just seem to be trying to hard to be goofey or weird. i liked the mel gibson character and the milla jovovich characters and wish they would have focused more on them. milla is of course beautiful, pitiful and you really feel for her and what she has been thru and why she is the way she is. i see gibsons character as almost frankenstien like. i just wish he would have save milla and brunt the hotel down with all the worthless boring characters that lived in it. milla rating 10 movie rating 0

even mel gibson couldnt save this slop of a movie. this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen. why would mel gibson make a movie that im sure he couldnt sit and watch? what was this? a total goofball on some heavy drugs stalking a schizophrinic lady, who was also on some heavy ilicit street drugs. for all the moviegoers out there on heavy drugs; you will love this movie.

riccardo freda may have a good reputation; but since we now that many of his best films were, in fact, directed by the late great mario bava; it's clear that he wasn't one of italy's most gifted filmmakers back in the seventies. this film pretty much proves that as despite the simplistic plot; it's a sprawling mess and overall, i'd even have to go as far as to say that tragic ceremony is worse than freda's insipid giallo effort, the iguana with the tongue of fire. freda apparently disowned this movie, and i certainly don't blame him! the plot simply follows a bunch of kids that run out of petrol in the middle of nowhere. they happen upon a house while searching for fuel; but it turns out to be a bad choice, as the owner is just about to conduct a satanic ceremony...ho hum. the film features a lead role for camille keaton, who would go on to star in the exploitation classic i spit on your grave some years later, but fails to make an impression here despite acting alongside a cast of talentless performers. the film features one decent gore scene towards the end, but this really isn't enough considering that it takes eighty minutes of tedium to get there. i have a high tolerance for rubbish italian films that don't make sense - but even i couldn't stand this one. miss it, miss nothing!

on the way home from a day at the beach, four young people seek shelter from a torrential downpour at the home of lord and lady alexander after their car runs out of gas. they don't know it, but the house they're staying in is to be the site of a satanic ritual. jane (camille keaton), the only female of the group, is to be sacrificed. as her male companions rush to her aid, one of them accidentally kills lady alexander. things really get out of hand and everyone else attending the black mass is also killed. the four try to make an escape, but soon discover there's no escape from what they've witnessed. one by one, they meet their fates.gong into tragic ceremony, i was positive i would enjoy it. slow-burn gothic horror is right up my alley. i'm also quite fond of some of riccardo freda's other movies like the horrible dr. hichcock, the ghost, and i vampiri. tragic ceremony seemed to be a sure thing. unfortunately, things don't always work out the way they should. the biggest tragedy with respect to tragic ceremony is the time i spent watching this mess of a movie. with a few minor exceptions, nothing about the film appealed to me or worked for me. the characters are unlikeable, the plot is incoherent and schizophrenic, and the pacing is terrible. there's a subplot about some cursed pearls that goes nowhere and only serves to confuse things even further. in addition, nothing interesting happens for most of the movie. by the time the four leads realize they're in danger, i was well past the point of caring. and i don't understand the reviews i've read that praise the acting of camille keaton. i suppose it's a terrific performance if you consider an emotionless daze to be acting. the three male leads are the very definition of nondescript. they do nothing to stand out. the supporting cast includes some genre favorites like luigi pistilli, luciana paluzzi, and paul muller, but none is given anything to do. in fact muller's main contribution is a two minute long monologue at the end of the movie that attempts to explain what happened in the previous 80 or so minutes. it's a weak attempt to provide a wrap-up to a very weak movie.

this late-ish effort from freda plays as a modern day (70's that is) gothic thriller, but comes out short of thrills. certainly it's not a dreadfully bad film, it's jut got that feeling which many of freda's later films have of someone who has given up when he's seen the first daily's. it starts out good enough, almost giallo like in tone, then takes a turn into gothic territories with a decent (albeit terribly cliché) set up. then suddenly freda seems to have lost interest in the film and all we get is prolonged shots of camille keaton and burning candles. then circa an hour into the film we get some sort of violent climax with decent-to-poor special effects. this is followed by a slow paced outro with a very obvious twist ending (if it's even intended to be a twist?). and throw a few very halfhearted explanatory scenes along the way and you got tragic ceremony. thus in parts it's got its qualities. but then suddenly stumbles and collapses in front of you. a pity.btw stay away from the sharoma dvd, a useless murky pan& scan edition which kills of what could be a good visual experience.

i will repeat - what a stupid scenario.is there anything new inside? i don't know who have wrote this. but i believe this guy have watch all hollywood -children -family -teens movies ever made... all scenes and dilouges u can see in everywhere. why do u people making this movies? children's like an adults? they like money gold cars... and they are positives? they have lucky... and emotions of course... without it can be done. o the young actors - wow :-). i do like when is camera concentrated on their nice faces? what a crap... there is 90% better children movies that this one! this is not creative or funny movie. this is simply nothing.d.

this is one of those "family" movies that i can't imagine having much appeal to anyone over about 9. a group of siblings discovers a "sand fairy" (yes, really) conveniently located at the end of a not-so-secret passage at the country home of their eccentric uncle, to which they've been evacuated from the london blitz. ...and there you have it, all in one sentence. the story is about the role of magic in childhood and the danger of getting wishes fulfilled, but neither of these issues is examined in a way that would be interesting to adults or instructive to children (or vice versa!). the only reason i can think of for watching this is to see how starkly freddie highmore's outstanding talent stands out from the rest of the mediocre performances.

the great war breaks out and daddy is a brave pilot who goes off to carry out some unsightly business to put jerry in his place. mummy is doing her bit as a nurse, so the five children are evacuated to their barmy uncle in the country, where a secret passageway takes them to a mischievous sand fairy and the beginning of a magical adventure.based on a book written the best part of a century ago, they don't make stories like this anymore. and there's a reason. the men fly planes and author books; the women change bandages and clean house. the boys lead the way with their compasses and nighttime furloughs; the girls do what they are told and play violin - badly. fat kids who wear specs are nasty. all the kids speak in those clipped, vowel-flattening accents that are soppy and prim but which a certain economic class of english people cultivate. on top of the snobbery and yearning for imperial albion, there are plot holes a five-year-old would not tolerate. i mean that literally - my son was asking why the father disappeared before sunset, why the compass didn't just drop from his hand as he disappeared. the film at least tries to aim strictly for the kids, until a completely inappropriate and unfunny monologue by eddie izzard (what a waste of genuine comic talent) plays over the final credits.no doubt the five percent of british schoolkids who go to expensive public schools in the uk will find it all such a jolly wheeze. for the other 95 percent of british families who no longer live in the 19th century, the good news is wall-e, ratatouille and wallace and gromit are all out on dvd.

1st watched 10/29/2006 - 4 out of 10(dir-john stephenson): mildly entertaining story of a group of five kids who are forced to live with their eccentric uncle while their father and mother fight & work in world war i as england entered the war. they are told not to go in the greenhouse of the uncle's mansion, which of course they do over and over, and they discover a sand fairy who them daily wishes that only last until the sun goes down. this is the "it" referred to in the title, created by the jim henson group and voiced by eddie izzard. the problem is their wishes usually bring about other problems that they are supposed to learn from. this part of the movie is not done very well because it's obvious the children, primarily the freddie highmore character, do not learn from them but instead keep going back to "it" to solve their next big problem. "it" is not nearly as funny as it could have been with the comedian eddie izzard really not given much opportunity to improvise and kenneth branagh is wasted as the eccentric uncle, although he is the best character. the children are fine as far as their acting abilities but the story probably would have been much better going into the fantasy realm but they did have a human story to tell as well, which probably caused the confusion with the filmmakers. so, all in all, this was an ok film but could have been much better.

i would think that this was one of those films whose director hadn't read the book it was based on, were it not for the fact that they are just slightly similar. it is certainly possible for a great film to be "based" very loosely on a book and this was certainly the latter but not the former.there were a number of flaws. one was that it tried to be too much like the railway children, probably because adults would expect this, being from the same author. another is that it also sought to be too like harry potter, down to the music and in overemphasizing the setting. i have nothing against j k rowling or the films but the book is just nothing like the harry potter ones. i thought the psammead, though very well voiced by eddie izzard and in character too, was almost gratuitously in a totally inappropriate environment. i may have missed something here, as the comments made about one of the characters' own books may have been a reference to the inaccuracy of the adaptation. there was also no need for the extra characters, and today's special effects could easily have been used to tell the story as it was written, but they weren't.i saw this film with my two children, one of whom knows the book and the other of whom doesn't. the one who does know it thought it was all right but wasn't as enthusiastic as the one who doesn't. i'm not sure what this means.

schieder delivers a semi-believable part as the president of the united states with politically correct maria conchita alonzo as the female vice president. the movie just stinks. with so many plot holes its a wonder they got it to stick to the film it was shot on. relegated to late night hbo time schedules, this film is not worth seeing at all. 10 minutes into it, you are asking yourself why it was written. 40 minutes into it, you are wondering why you are watching it. save the effort and watch a re-run of hee haw or something. anything is better than this clunker.

ugh. this movie has so many unbelievable plot contrivances that they made what could have been a good movie into a hideous mess. the story is halfway decent, but the holes in the plot make the execution literally laughable. we're actually supposed to believe that the secret service would go against all common sense and allow the president of the united states to be put at unbelievable risk. if this is an indication of the kind of thinking that passes for good judgment among the president's protectors, then we're all in trouble. roy scheider turns in a good performance as the president, but it is unfortunately offset by the truly loathsome acting of patrick muldoon (who somehow continues to get jobs in hollywood based solely upon his good looks and his uncanny knack of smirking at every opportunity, regardless of whether the script calls for a smirk). perhaps someone will see this and be inspired to make a good movie from the premise--or, perhaps someone will see it and say, "hey, if they can get a movie this bad made, maybe i can, too!"

^^contains spoilers^^this movie is utter crap. do not watch.there is no one in this movie to root for, or even like, except for the wife, and she wins by default. everyone is selfish, and many things happen that make no sense.the acting is mediocre at best and everyone breathes too heavily about everything. no one can even cry believably.if you leave the room for even a second, then something totally out of left field will happen, and it will make no sense whatsoever.for example, i left the room for a second, while jennie garth's character was sleeping with her manager. i come back, seriously about 4 minutes later, (also i'm pretty sure there was a commercial somewhere in there) and she's sleeping with that berko guy. i gave up on this movie around the time that berko was being an ass to his fiancé in the car, because she didn't want to call off the wedding.i wasted 2 hours of my life. you shouldn't.

as i was flipping through the channel i came to a channel 124. it is an urban channel. i saw this movie on and decided to give it a try. i almost became a mass murderer due to this film. i have done home movies and they are oscar quality compared to this huge mass of dookie. the lighting was terrible and the acting was absolutely unrelentlessly bad. i would rather watch star crystal....... holy cow maybe that is not a good example. the main question i have about this film is... was it to be a morality film? the reason why i ask is because ther was one line where this lady in a wheelchair says " i would have been another gang statistic" oh my head is starting to hurt. after hearing that line i went into the kitchen and pulled out a knife ready to stab anyone who dared watch this movie. but some sense kicked in and i just changed the channel to watch the man with the afro paint. well that is all i have to say about this movie. if you want to endure this pain go ahead but not recommended for those with short fuses or a bad case of tourettes

i remember watching this movie on tv a few years back. it was so bad, i can only remember the scenes that just made me die laughing. the only plot summary i can give you (without any spoilers) is picture a home movie made by college kids who were high.(spoiler alert starts here...) when the movie starts, a guy's running, being chased by the "demon cop", when in fact, the man was really being chased by a halloween costume gone wrong. a car pops out of nowhere, hitting the guy who was running. it sends him flying over the top of it, and what does the driver do??? watches the man as he falls, gets back in his car and drives away. what kind of hair-brained dolt would do that? i would've at least asked if the guy was okay.then, some black guy stares the demon cop straight in the face, then, later tells reporters, "i didn't get a good look at him." my sisters and i, by then, were almost choking ourselves to death with laughter.then, there's some scene in an alley, where this girl with an afro, pulls a machine gun out of her teeny-weeny little purse. it couldn't have possibly fit!! i can hardly remember certain scenes. maybe it's because they were just that bad.cops in the film can't even jump a fence, and the acting is so wooden, it makes planks of wood look like better actors.all in all, this movie brings shame to hollywood, way more than any other flop could. you have to see it to believe its sappy cheesy plot, which it has none of, as far as i can tell.

one night on an independent channel famous for showing off-the-wall films was aired this monstrosity. though tempted to turn it off, we watched it to the bitter end, hoping to see some semblance of redeeming value. alas, there was none. absolutely nothing. the film quality was cheap; the soundtrack was muddy; the editing was ridiculous. then again, there was precious little to salvage. after a few minutes of cameron mitchell's doctor character narrating about some patient of his, the viewer is tortured by no plot, pathetic writing, abysmally terrible acting, and an utter lack of cohesion and continuity. the rotting cherry on top of this fetid mess was the most horrendous "special effects" and "makeup" to ever disgrace the screen, even for television. the main character stumbles through his role in a dimestore rubber mask and a pair of dishwashing gloves which appear to have been dipped in glue and rolled in beads. perhaps the poor lighting and gag-worthy film quality were attempting to cover up how bad-to-the-tenth-power the makeup was. one can only hope that at least one deliberate decision was made in the course of this hopelessly amateurish video. seriously, a handful of three-year-old kids could've produced a better project. at the end, poor mr. mitchell returns (how desperate he must've been for money!) and drones out some nonsense that's supposed to connect this pile of crap with the aids epidemic. please spare you and your loved ones the inhuman cruelty of sitting through this. it was so bad, even mystery science theater 3000 couldn't have salvaged it.

this is a movie that was probably made to entertain the middle school, early high school age kids. maybe to them it's funny, they may possibly even see something scary in it. to me, the acting is poor, and plot is poor, there's just not much value at all for the adult viewer. i saw this film as weak and boring. at times there was the possibility that the movie could become interesting but it never really materialized. the creatures look pretty good but after seeing them for a few seconds, they don't seem to have any substance other than the look. at times i wasn't sure if the movie was trying to make another attempt at comedy or was it just another attempt at horror that failed again. this movie just wasn't good for me.

this is one of the worst movies i've seen in my life. if you're looking for a nice theatrical effect, skip it and watch something else.but if you're looking for camp-value, this is it. here's my advice: gather a few sarcastic friends and watch the movie strictly for the purpose of making fun of it.

this movie's only redeeming factor was the fact that it was on tv for free, and that it probably helped the romanian economy. other than that, hallmark needs to re-evaluate this division of their empire, and maybe keep their movies more oriented towards bizarre love affairs between cancer-stricken hemophiliacs in mississippi. to go into details about how mindless this movie is would give credit to it for being memorable. it wasn't. i remember the act of watching it, there being vampires (some of them teenage) and some very bad dubbing. whoever worked on the dubbing track of this movie needs to be relocated to another sector of society...maybe food service, to the deaf. if you have the opportunity, watch this movie, just because it makes so many other really bad movies seem oscar-worthy in retrospect. then again, if you actually ended up at this movie's profile, i imagine that it may be too late...

this story starts at the end ! so the film's opening credits advise us. unfortunately that's not true as we then are treated to around 70 minutes of a typical b science fiction movie of the 1950's. the story is dreary; the plot is very weak and has clearly been filmed on a low budget, as was often the case in those days.the story could have covered any situation where people are taking refuge in an isolated house and being threatened by someone outside. it just happened to be adapted to fit round a sci-fi story.the scenery consisted of a few rocks, bushes, and smoke. - oh yes there was a pool of water as well. someone wore a rubber mask with a beak like face and what looked like feathers.written by lou rusoff, who penned several sci-fi stories around that time including the she creature and it conquered the world the filming was completed in a matter of days, not allowing the actors time to develop their characters to better advantage. the low budget restraints also prevented this film reaching its potential. it could have been a much better film than it turned out to be.mike connors and richard denning brought some life to the film, but even they could not lift this film into the category where you could say- 'i enjoyed that film' richard denning's acting career began in 1937. he starred with gregory peck and deborah kerr in an affair to remember and later became more well known on television in the series hawaii five-o and the flying doctor series.directed by roger corman who has many films to his credit both as a director and producer. he has made some good films and is still making them. he became very well known for his direction of films from the stories of edgar allan poe, often starring vincent price. he also made other low budget films; some were good and entertaining for one reason or another, and most were much better than this.i would not recommend this film to anyone.darnmay 10th september 2007

this is a very low budget film, set in one location in a valley shielded by the effects of radiation. the cast, an older man and daughter, a handsome visitor, a couple (a tough buy and gal), a drifter, a donkey and a radiation affected man, interact during the after effects of a nuclear blast. added to this is an entity watching the women take a bath.they all have guns, some of them get shot, some of them are told to have children, others are murdered and others just drift away and, well this is the movie. harvey cormann's first film, it shows a certain simplicity in movie making. to avoid expensive sets, actors go through curtains to enter and exit the house (ie the studio). the location shots filmed in the hills near hollywood are the backdrop.i would not say this is worth going out of your way to see, but interesting to see how movies with human subjects were made in the 50s.

a 1957 roger corman non epic in which a sundry bunch of characters end up in a lead lined valley (sic) just as stock footage thermo nuclear heck is unleashed. it's the end of the world. four men with guns, two women, (one an unmarried virgin the other a las vegas show gird who drinks and smokes - guess which one makes it to the end of the movie?) time passes, tensions develop (or are supposed to). something is in the woods eating radioactive rabbits. a mutant monster! seven weeks of radioactive dust has performed "a million years of evolution" (on an already living human) the result is a laughably bad, zip up the back, rubber monster who is strangely scared of their only source of fresh water. it rains. the monster dissolves. the remaining two characters, the hunk and the virgin. set out to repopulate the world as the caption 'the beginning' fills the screen after it transpires that the brief shower of rain had washed all the radioactivity away and dissolved all the monsters running around 'out there'.the only thing of real note about this is the incredible amount of 'curtain acting' that goes on in it. one of the staple elements of bad and lo budget movie making of the period was the superabundant use of curtains in the set design. it was cheap. finished with one set-up? pull a curtain across, drop a different piece of furniture in front of it and you have a different location in minutes without having to move the camera or change the lighting.'curtain acting' is a skill in which the actor will get to comment on what's going on outside any building he happens to be in ("it looks like rain", or "here they come now, and it looks like they've got the sheriff with them!", that sort of stuff). he'll do this by standing to one side of the window - reaching across his body and lifting the curtain away from the window but along the axis of the shot - ie towards the camera - thus enabling him to pretend to look out and tell us what's happening off screen, without letting the audience see he's staring at the studio wall three inches away from his nose behind some cheap velvet curtains. there was a lot of that in this movie.

a group of seven people fear they are the only survivors of a near world ending h-bomb blast. not only do they fear the radiation, but also mutants in the surrounding hillside. one of the group is already contaminated, but strangely poses no real threat to the others. just surviving the friction of assorted personalities at close range is the sub-plot. richard denning plays the hero. mike connors is close to the edge playing a tough guy. lori nelson is the girl destined to start populating a brave new world. not one of director roger corman's best. this is predictable black and white sci-fi.

that distinction has to go to the dungeon of harrow. at least ed wood's misguided attempt at making a quality science fiction film had the dubious "star" power of bela lugusi, vampira, tor johnson, criswell and lyle talbot. the dungeon of harrow has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. what could have been an interesting and suspenseful plot about a marooned aristocrat on a leper colony, perhaps in the style of the island of dr. moreau or mysterious island, is trashed by the heavy dialog and mono tonal acting of amateurs whose lines sink like lead weights into a sea of stupidity. the "special effects", which took place in someone's bathtub, further doom this film to the dung heap. even the treatment of leprosy is something out of a victorian interpretation of the bible. the fact that leprosy can not be contracted from an individual in its last stages belies the plot line that the aristocrat fallon and his lady, cassandra contract the disease and end up as the original occupants of the castle de sade, doomed to insanity and inhuman cruelty. it is interesting to note that not one member of the cast made another film. no wonder, talent begets talent; lack of talent begets oblivion, which is where this film should find its deplorable end.

this movie shows what you can create if you have a camera, some spare paint and cardboard,a toy ship, a few friends who acted in community theater, and the incorrect notion you can make a film. the end result is an unwatchable time-waster that you'll skip through, unless you take it out of the dvd player and toss it through the window first.the acting in the opening scene (especially by the rotund lee morgan as 'captain') and the toy ship "crashing" into the rocks before the credits is a good indicator of what you're in for (with all the foam, it looks like this "special effect" was shot in a kitchen sink. i guess boyette figured he save some cash by washing the dishes at the same time). in terms of bad cinema, the funny thing is "dungeon of harrow" seems to have inspired (maybe by coincidence) the twist ending of "manos: the hands of fate". yep, it's the same lame "i was the victim, and now i take the mad villain's place" ironic ending. the bigger irony is that two inept, talentless filmmakers could make two equally-wretched, texas-filmed horror movies and get away with it.monotone nerd russ harvey is a noble in a great family line (why they were great is never broached), boring us while lamenting the death of his family line and crest before his ship even crashes (we're also treating to a droning narration throughout the film). sadly, we aren't so lucky. his family's toy ship crashes into some styrofoam in a sink, and he's washed ashore with his bloated captain and some woman, conveniently deposited on a mad count's island.meanwhile, the count is visited by an evil spirit who, dressed in a blackstone's magic kit outfit, assaults him with various puppets (spiders, snakes, bats. . . all the icky stuff). the count (william mcnulty) overacts worse than shatner and has a visibly difficult time keeping a straight face through the typical madman ranting.i'd be mad too if i had to be in this disaster. the woman is promptly killed by the count's ferocious dogs, and the two jerks are captured by his manservant. the count accuses them of being pirates (apparently his worst fear), he slaps his manservant around a lot (apparently his greatest joy), fatboy gets tortured, there's a woman who's a servant and one who's a nurse, the rotting leper hag-in-a-wedding-dress countess in the dungeon (she digs the nerdy noble and is the only effective & creepy thing in the movie), a lot of inane dialogue at a dining room table, the blubbery captain gets killed while making a pathetic getaway (aking to watching a sloth battle a pack of lions). . . it's all an ugly haze to me. i spent most of my time on the fast-forward button.anyway, the jerk noble and nurse make a getaway and think they're going to be rescued by three guys in a rowboat on the lake (yeah, we're supposed to believe a lake is the ocean). they don't, since the nerd's hair turned gray and he scares the would-be rescuers away. honestly, i think they simply took the opportunity to row away from this hideous film while the had the chance. they head back to the castle, the nurse starts rotting like the countess (and your stomach, by this time), and we end with these two getting ready to descend into the . . . dungeon of harrow!!!! blech!i love old, lousy horror films, but they must have some sort of entertainment value. i feel ripped off, even at the low low price of $5.99 for this biscuit. mystery science theater would have a tough time making this one fun. i was taken in by a few nutty reviewers who claimed this film had atmosphere and some creepy moments. wrong! avoid this tripe at all costs, and don't even waste a buck if you find it in a dollar bin somewhere. this movie makes corman's "the terror" like like a masterpiece of horror and atmosphere.

if it was possible to give negative stars i would for this stinkburger.don't get me wrong i loooooovvveeee a good crappy movie. i am a big fan of films like octoman, wizard of mars, queen king and others. real classics of b-cinema.but this film actually makes jack nicolson and boris karloff in the terror look like an academy award winner!! the dialouge is so needlessly long-winded, and mostly inappropriately used. (ie. "i will now condensened (yes, condensend!!) to your wishes. the acting might have been a lot better if they had some more logical lines.the story? what story, a count is exiled because his wife had leprosy? i'm still not sure on that count. a (rich?) fleet one and the captian of one of his ships crash on the island? people acting unnaturally? ok, i like camp in b-films a lot, there lies a lot of it's charm, but this was just dumb..plain dumb. a salty sea captian who sounds as well versed as a college professor? a fleet owner who is as clueless as they come (i felt this guy had no idea of how to play it, one scene he's spanish acting, the next english/european)? the count, who's not sure if he's a reincarnation or really desade (don't ask me how desade figures into this, after 4 beers my wife, friend and i still couldn't figure it out.the scare factor? i could show this turkey to my small grandkids and only worry about them sleeping through it. i like a lot of early 60's horror movies, and some still have good shocks, but this thing...never had a shock, or even a hint of of a scare.on the info on the back it says, "this movie contains scenes that are so vivid and degrading that they will surpass your worst nightmare." the only degradation is watching this movie. it's 90 mins.(the case says it's 74 mins.) of your life you do not get back.i paid only a buck, yes one buck, for this and another film. i still feel like i am owed .50 cents for even sitting though this.to sum up dungeon of harrow had no one named harrow in it, but, it did have a lovely cardboard dungeon.

why can't a movie be rated a zero? or even a negative number? some movies such as "plan nine from outer space" are so bad they're fun to watch. this is not one. "the dungeon of horror" might be the worst movie i've ever seen (some of anyway. i had to fast forward through a lot of it!). fortunately for the indiscretions of my youth and senility of my advancing age, there may be worse movies i've seen, but thankfully, i can't remember them. the sets appeared to be made with cardboard and finished with cans of spray paint. the special effects looked like a fifth grader's c+ diorama set in a shoebox. the movie contained unforgivable gaffs such as when the marquis shoots and kills his servant. he then immediately gets into a scuffle with his escaping victim, who takes his flintlock and shoots him with it, without the gun having been reloaded! this movie was so bad my dvd copy only had name credits. i guess no company or studio wanted to be incriminated. though i guess when you film in your garage and make sets out of cardboard boxes a studio isn't needed. this movie definitely ranks in my cellar of all time worst movies with such horrible sacrileges as "the manipulator", the worst movie i have ever seen with an actual (one time) hollywood leading man-mickey rooney. the only time i would recommend watching "the dungeon of harrow" (or "the manipulator" for that matter) would be if someone were to pay you. (i'm kind of cheap) i'd have to have $7 or $8 bucks for "dungeon" and at least ten for "manipulator". phil-the never out of the can cinematographer

this movie tries to be more than it is. first of all, the acting is horrible. you have to get past the incredibly bad delivering of lines and terrible emoting. the plot is quite interesting. a shipwreck occurs (apparently because it was made out of strings and balsa wood), and a couple of guys find themselves on shore. if this weren't bad enough, some guy named count de sade is living there as well. he lives in fear of pirates and has gone utterly insane. anyway, he has a large slave, a young woman, and some dogs. there's another woman who doesn't speak and his wife, who is a leper. anyway, things get bad as these men have to deal with this nut case. he is arrogant and likes to pose and deliver lines. the rest of the movie involves an attempt to escape. it has an ironic ending which i won't reveal and it kind of rescues the film. i wouldn't bother if i were you.

a couple of men are ship-wrecked on a remote island. they are then captured by an insane count who lives there with a small group of servants; while in the castle dungeon lives the count's unfortunate leper wife.the dungeon of harrow is pretty much a hack job of a movie. the amateur actors all sleepwalk through the film while an annoyingly insistent score continually plays in the background. the various bits of action are all filmed in an incredibly unenergetic way; in fact the film in general is completely lethargic. it just seems to drag on and on. and even though the ending isn't too bad you will be hard-pressed to care by that point. as an example of 60's gothic horror, this is strictly a bargain basement example. i sadly can't recommend this one really.

"dungeon of harrow" had a lot of things that could've made this quite a good horror film. creepy mansion, a torture chamber, a paranoid host, a henchman, a ghoul in the dungeon, etc. but sadly to say this wasn't made very well.a writer and a skipper get shipwrecked on an island owned by a count in a castle, his slave, and a mute maid. the count becomes more and more suspicious that the two shipwrecked men are pirates (of all things) and gets more inclined to turn on them and subject them, and the mute maid who befriends them, to torture and imprisonment. sound not-bad right? well, not quite. i used to call this one of the worst movies i have ever seen, but now i hesitate. because it had so much potential it can't really be called "one of the worst." however, seeing all this potential go to waste is a really big hit against this film. all in all, it's not a very good movie.there is a very gothic-suspense scene when our hero is chained in the dungeon and is confronted by the insane and leprous rotting bride, adorned in a tattered wedding dress. this was both creepy and disturbing the first time i saw the horror unfold in this scene. man i wish this was a better movie! this movie had all the right stuff to make this a moody late-night chiller, but ultimately took all the wrong turns. i suggest someone remake this one.

this weird movie from texas is about fallon, a dilettante rich boy in the late 1800s (although he looks like a 60s c&w singer with greasy hair and sideburns) whose ship wrecks on an island owned by count desade (pronounced de-sayd) with his captain. the count is afraid of pirates and tortures a young girl who was once a pirate hostage and also tortures the captain. meanwhile, creepy former nurse cassandra tells fallon the secrets of the castle. the countess has leprosy and went mad! fallon is trapped but brings supplies. the captain is killed by a racist-caricature slave. fallon is thrown in the dungeon with the leper, who always thinks it's her wedding day. the leper bride is horny, bu cassandra kills her. fallon and cassandra escape the castle, but the count and his slave chase them with dogs. desade kills the slave and fallon kills desade. fallon and cassandra fall in love over the course of the next year, but when the supply ship comes, the crew refuses to take our lovers because they're both lepers now. they live for years in the castle...fallon's hair turns gray and cassandra goes bonkers. fallon puts her in the dungeon. our tale of love and leprosy ends.so bizarre it's watchable, and you can smell the drive-in popcorn.

the basic idea behind "dungeon of harrow" isn't all bad. the acting, however, is bad. the lighting is bad. the music is bad. the scenes of torture are without emotion. there really isn't much there to recommend this film. you know what kind of a movie you're in for when the credits say "special guest star" and list someone you've never heard of. might as well say "rex hamilton as abraham lincoln." because there's really no one in this movie you can identify. there are one or two decent moments, mostly toward the end and i think the basic plot outline may have contained an original idea, but that alone is not enough to keep you awake through this otherwise inept yawner.

buyer beware. the alpha video release uses a print that defies description. the movie was shot in color but you wouldn't know it for the first 25 minutes or so. the print that is used is so faded and decrepit that it appears almost sepia toned. after 30 minutes some color seeps back into the print but from there to the conclusion the color comes and goes. keep in mind, even at it's best the color is pale and washed out. it looks like the print was recorded off a television that wasn't getting the best reception. adding to this travesty is the most plodding delivery of lines that i can recollect. even the voice over narration is stupor inducing. every line is delivered in this irritating plodding demeanor. i found myself wishing that they would hurry and get the words out. for this reason i couldn't wait for this movie to end. it's one of those so-bad -it's- good movies but i wish that someone would find a half decent print.

my bad film guru (and the president of the exposed film society) sprang this one on us last week. there was no denying the demented gleam in his eye as he pulled it out of its brown paper bag and announced what he had in store for us: "the most dangerous game", filmed on a budget of about $2.95.of course, $2.95 went a lot further back in 1962, but still...anyway, there is certainly a lot to dislike about this film. it abounds with serious technical gaffes (my favorite was the 'repeating musket' that fired twice in two minutes without benefit of a reload). the hero is a wuss who stands by while his wounded friend fights the henchman and gets killed. more? ok -the plot is a shambles with no continuity to speak of. the movie wastes five minutes with a 'special guest star' who serves as the physical embodiment of the villain's madness and paranoia, but never shows him again. the hero is choked unconscious by the henchman but makes no mention of it when he wakes up and first meets his host. the mute servant girl is captured, put on the rack...and then the movie (and the hero, who put her in this predicament) just sort of "forgets" about her. more? well, the sets are cheap, and the special effects are cheaper (the makeup is an exception to this). much of the plot is carried by the narrator's droning, monotonic voice-over, which carries less dramatic impact than the menu recital at denny's. most of the dialog is simply ridiculous and stilted , as if it was translated from japanese. ("i demand that our conversation be pleasant!!!") and the color values tended to shift violently from shot to shot, as if cheap film stock and problematic lighting equipment were the order of the day. (note - this last may have been the fault of a bad print, rather than the camera crew). but there were a couple of nice moments here and there. the makeup effects were startlingly good in contrast to the rest of the film, the actors were looked interesting, especially the mute servant girl and the countess. and in spite of everything, there was a definite creepy atmosphere to be found, very nasty and disturbing.so what was the deal with this movie? i thought about it a bit, and realized that director/writer pat boyette basically tried to put a story from of the old "ec" horror comics on film. that would account for the stilted dialog, the sketchy character development (in a comic, physiognomy = character even more than in film), the loopy interior logic of the story ("ec" horror stories went out of their way to include a nasty "shock" ending and weren't big on psychological realism), the over reliance on the narrative voice (which belongs in captions over the panels), and the interesting makeup effects that mimicked the grisly pictures that the old ec artists did so well.in fact, i'd be willing to bet that when boyette saw his leading man during casting, he instantly saw that the fellow was as close to being the equivalent of the lanky, shambling figures and caved in faces that artists like johnny craig and jack davis drew as an actual human could be and still exist in the real world.. he used costumes and lighting to emphasize the cartoony aspect of the visuals and turned everyone into living ec comics characters. (see: the leading lady's blank beauty, the count's strong bony features, oddly bronze skin and sharp chin, the platinum 'do on the tall, bony black henchman, etc.) this would explain the movie's failings. boyette knew how to 'frame' things, but he didn't know how to deal with three dimensions and moving bodies. boyette knew how to tell a creepy story within the confines of a comics page, but the nuances of film and live actors escaped him. he wouldn't be the first person with this problem of course - look at what joel schumacher did to "batman". but he didn't have a big budget to hide behind.in any case, i'm imagine that boyette walked away from this train wreck and probably spent less time thinking about "dungeon of harrow"than the folks who post on this film's message boards. he did, within certainly vague boundaries, what he set out to do, and you have to respect him for it...even if you don't care for "harrow".

**may contain spoilers**the main character, a nobleman named fallon, is stranded on an island with characters so looney and lethal he might have been better off drowning. count lorente de sade (pronounced "dee-sayd") talks to his own hallucinations and sees all intruders on the island as invading pirates. he routinely beats mute servant anne and tortures his unwilling guests in the dungeon. inadvertant laughs are provided by giant "nubian" slave mantis who talks with a deep south accent and helps de sade hunt down trespassers in the style of the most dangerous game. de sade's crazed wife, ravaged by leprosy, provides some truly scary moments as she prowls the dungeon and embraces a helplessly chained prisoner. (this scene was viewed on late-night tv by many kids who carried the memory into adulthood.) the one nearly-normal person in sight is cassandra, who has self-deprecation down to a science. ("i used to be a nurse, now i'm not much of anything.") she and fallon plan their escape and ultimately encounter an enemy more fearsome than de sade and mantis combined.	this movie was shot in san antonio and directed by a man more competent at drawing horror comics than making horror movies. (i'll say this much for mr. boyette--he does showcase his fixatation with contagion here, as he did in his comics.) it's rather like an andy milligan melodrama minus the meat cleavers. the period wardrobe, library music, abuse of the handicapped and all-around misanthropy makes one wonder if andy wasn't called in as a consultant. however, milligan made better costumes and wrote better dialogue. technical gaffes are too numerous to list here but you know this flick is in trouble when you see the opening shipwreck, which looks like it was shot in a fish tank. also, a film made in texas should have had real spiders and snakes rather than rubber ones. glorious eastmancolor gives this melodrama the garish look it so richly deserves. fallon's initial encounter with the leprous countess is truly horrifying, as is the movie's parting shot. if the rest had been half as harrowing, the dungeon of harrow would have been a terror classic. instead it's a funny piece of schlock that trash-fiends will love, for all the wrong reasons.

okay, make no mistake - this is a pretty awful film, but i actually thought it had a couple of creepy scenes and overcame its pathetic budget every now and then. at the very least it's unintentionally funny in spots and has a definite air of creepiness and discomfort (a face burning scene, the part with the disfigured bride). this baby falls into the "so bad it's entertaining" category to me, and for that alone i would give it a star. the effects are terrible, the acting is abysmal, and the whole thing looks like it was shot in a day. you gotta love that toy ship at the beginning, too! it brought back childhood memories of seeing this on late night tv many years ago. while the alpha dvd print looks weak and as though it was recorded directly off an old television broadcast or something, i actually liked that in this case!

the film successfully gives a graphic portrayal of the suffering of forced sex labour, but nothing more. the leftest agenda behind this movie could be seen a mile away and leaves viewer so embarrassed while watching if you know that feeling. so, the women are kidnapped and sent to ex yugoslavian territory to work as sex slaves because (take a deep breath) the american military institution is corrupt and looks away while their private security contractors are selling people abroad. you don't need half a brain to see the relevance to iraq war and black water company.what a load of leftest excrement! looks like i have been fooled all my life into thinking that this problem and many others were a direct result of communism's grip on this region for 45 years. but no, it was the american war on iraq, which is also responsible for earthquakes, tropical storms, and the constipation i had last week.the film ignores the fact that 95% of the sex trade is women willing to sell their bodies for money and entry to the western block. you also see scenes that are so stupid you want to pull your hair. we have someone chasing down a woman in the streets of london in broad daylight, beat her up, then somehow drags her unconscious body half a mile back to the apartment where he rapes her. no one sees this or calls the police, and the running woman does not care to scream during the chase. even better, we later see 4-5 women lined up in the centre of london in -again- broad daylight to be sold, one of them has a smashed face, and people are shopping in the background as if nothing was happening. you can't make this stupidity up.i used to think that such trash was exclusive to hollywood, but apparently i was mistaken.

the movie begins with much voice-over, a bad sign. then it just slides downhill with silly and intelligence-insulting scenes involving trappers and indians. but, it reaches new and impressive lows when all the merry mountain men square dance with each other in a high alpine meadow. meanwhile, the happy-go-lucky indians sit around watching them. it's a better scene than the dancing cowboys in "blazing saddles". there is a minor flaw in this comparison; "across the wide missouri" is not a comedy.

of all the directors ever to sit behind a camera wellman could break your heart quicker than anyone. even ford. but this is one of his worst. even he seemed to know it, probably from its jejune treatment, not much above a bonanza or big valley. yet there is one moment, typical wellman that comes out of nowhere to shatter you, the death of the indian wife of gable. she has gone to give her baby some water and wham is killed by an arrow instantly. no warning. nada. one of the most shocking, unprepared for deaths in all cinema. particularly after investing a whole hour of love for the lady in what looked to be a sappy western. of course the treatment of her afterwards is laden with wellman's total indifference, apparently, to the film. even so it is a reminder of the power he has always had at his best.

for those that might send me nasty e-mails, shove it. there is a trend in hollywood where those that create overly-quirky movies are instantly impervious to criticism. garden state tends to be one of those movies. sure, zach braff, star of a rather overrated sitcom, surprises people with some talent behind the camera, but that doesn't warrant the kind of praise that a film like this has been receiving. the story is often times too thin and shallow to provide any real insight. people have compared this film to the graduate, but those type of people are the types that try to oversell independent cinema. indie films are subject to the same hit and miss mentality that typically hits the studio films, but people seemed to have forgotten that there are far more bad indie films than good ones. garden state isn't atrocious, but its isn't great.first off, the film is too quick, resulting in a rather fast reemergence of large into his former life. after ten years, people tend to act like he never left. where's the awkwardness? of course, the situation is always solved by a quick drug tasting scene (which i will say was portrayed rather accurately). the film seem to present a lot of emotional inequities, giving us the idea that the emotion will come up later in a more deeper and more well thought out way. however, it fails to deliver on those fronts, leaving us wondering why the journey to some of his decisions and moments were quickly resolved (like peter saarsgard's grave robbing tendencies). it wasn't completely abysmal, but maybe we should stop praising the film as something it isn't.

"garden state" is another of these "indie"-type pictures that supposedly skimp on production values for the sake of giving the audience some real true-to-life human drama. oddly enough, the production is very good, so are the performances (by some fairly big-name actors as well). where the picture is lacking is in zach braff's script, which seems mostly culled from situations taken from other movies.when you're as young as braff is, you haven't really lived enough to use the experience as film fodder. braff's experience looks to be from watching movies, then repeating the same trite clichés in his own movie. in garden state, he plays andrew largeman, a semi-successful hollywood actor who returns to his hometown in new jersey to bury his mother, who took her own life after suffering in a wheelchair for many years. he appears to have no feeling about any of this; he has no relationship with his father, who blames him for causing his mother's paralysis in a freak accident as a six-year-old, and has no particular despondency over losing his mother (in fact, he attends a party right after the burial to which he was invited by a friend of his, who works as a cemetery grave-digger). it all smacks heavily of "beautiful girls", also about a guy who returns to his hometown to "find himself" and hang with his old friends, with a little "ordinary people" thrown in on the side. it's really a miracle braff could accomplish anything at all in his life, given his father and his useless friends (i'm surprised he didn't kill himself), who are still living their "lives" as though they're still in high school, partying with dumb bimbos, drinking and drugging, etc. none of them even recognize him from his tv role as the "retarded quarterback" (natalie portman's character, the most aware person in the movie, does), and say things, like "hey, i remember you from junior year". these guys are such losers, for them, watching television would be a cultural leap forward. even one friend, who made millions inventing a silent velcro, has no real reason to live, because his whole frame of reference is high school and partying. and you don't need big money to party like a high school sophomore.braff, it is revealed, is heavily medicated, which keeps from "feeling" and dealing with anything, really, like an adult would. then he meets sam (natalie portman) a sort-of lost girl, who gives pet funerals and lives with her mother like a 10-year-old in a bedroom that looks like a pink doll house blown up to life size. anyway, they fall in love, and braff learns to "feel" again. the clichés come fast and furious. braff has a long delayed heart-to-heart talk with his cold, distancing father and tells him what it is and the name of the game. in one scene, braff and portman are in the millionaire kid's house, playing touchy-feely is front of a giant fireplace, and the bit is so routine, so standard movie-schtick, i swear, i half-expected somebody to walk up and throw a sled into the fire. in another, braff visits a doctor (ron liebman) to get his junk refilled, and liebman tells him (in easily the worst line in the movie) "the body can play tricks on you. i once found my ex-best-friend's cufflinks in my wife's purse, and i didn't have an erection for a year and a half." obviously, no licensed physician would ever say that, but it's dirtbag poetry, a nod from braff to, i guess, his loser friends to let them know he's still thinking of them, just as the "37" joke in "clerks", was kevin smith's nod to his dirtbag buddies. anyway, braff finds true happiness and gets off the dope; the story plays itself out predictably. but if you're going to have a movie that's wall-to-wall clichés, at least give it some charming performances to breathe some life into it. and braff does. he has the right sort of vacancy, of casual acceptance to make his role as the zonked-out andrew both real and poignant, and natalie portman (also of beautiful girls) gives the movie a big lift. with her tiny features and flickering expressions of mood, she just about steals the picture as his traveling companion. jean smart is surprisingly good as portman's mother, and peter saarsgard (though much better in "shattered glass") is notable as the gravedigger friend. i would recommend "garden state" if you can't get enough storybook romance out of movies, but when people start hailing it as a masterpiece, they're just clueless. braff thinks you can take the same old tired plot, write in a few "f**ks" and "awesomes" and slap on an acoustic rock soundtrack and that contemporizes the material. it doesn't.

wave after wave of directionless nausea - this film wants and at first promises to be quirky and original but is in fact obvious, solipsistic and mired in cliché-driven dialogue which builds to a crecendo of awfulness and cheese by the end. throughout the film we meet supposedly off the wall characters, who are actually very dull, and just don't quite work and who clunk through the horrific screenplay like men in armour suits, driving jeeps through mansion houses and spouting preppy existential obviousness accompanied by the whinings of coldplay. the film has occasional funny episodes, often no funnier than a dog playing with its genitals, which happened twice (an index of the slapstick, rudimentary humour of the film in general) but by the end, the film falls into an 'infinite abyss' of complete detritus and the director's egocentric ramblings which made me want to gouge my eyes out. watch this film at your peril.

i have no qualms with how the movie does not capture new jersey (like zach, i'm from there). fine. whatever. i lived there way long enough. i don't need to see a movie that captures the garden state.what i do have qualms with is how bad this movie is. let's make it easy on you. we'll use some bullet-points. there are probably some spoilers that follow. (not that you wouldn't be able to predict the movie anyway): -the music placement was maddeningly forced and patronizing. example: large: "what are you listening to?" sam: "the shins. ever heard of 'em?" "no." "listen to this song - it will change your life!" and then they proceed to play that shins song that was in a mcdonalds commercial. (don't you love when the characters in a movie blatantly tell you - the viewer - how to react to something? i love that! hey, they should have put subtitles during various scenes instructing us to "chuckle," "say 'aaaaaw'" "cry" "feel inspired" etc.) -the scenes were so bad. so cliché. so melodramatic. example: the entire movie. but no, really, example: they're in the rainy quarry by the ark. large runs up - in the pouring rain (oh he's so tormented!) - on top of a piece of heavy machinery and screams! oh how moving! but wait! here comes sam and his buddy (the annoying drug addict), and they all scream!!!! but wait!!!! oh my god!!!! here it comes! they kiss!!! long, deep!!!! in the rain!!!!!!!! -the dialogue was so bad. so cliché. so melodramatic. example. they're leaving the ark and sam says something like, "hey. good luck exploring the infinite abyss." and the guy says back, "you, too." oh...oh my! i never realized...could it be? oh my god it is! large's life is like...ohmigod...an infinite abyss!!!! another example: large and sam in the airport. sam says something like, "is this goodbye?" not enough for ya? ok, largeman says something like, "this isn't a period at the end of the sentence... it's an ellipses." and guess what happens when he tries to walk down the jetway and go back to his life in la. you know, what? don't guess. it's a waste of your time.-it's a grade z wes anderson rip-off movie. when not busy being melodramatic and cliché, the movie spends lots of times with crazy-kooky-off-kilter characters. hey, sam's brother... thank you zach braff for including him, because it really made the movie so much more textured. also ripping off anderson: the dialogue. scene: sam and largeman are in a bar. in walks friends, "vagina!" says one of them. then they see him sitting with sam, so one of the friends says, "sorry i said vagina." and sam says, "it's ok." -inventive cinematography that's not inventive but pointless and annoying. give me a break with the speed-up/slow down of film. again, wes anderson does it effectively in his movies. and it was done well in "donnie darko." but, really, it was pointless. wow. a crazy party where people are taking x and snorting coke. better roll out all the tricks! -you can count the good moments on one hand (even if you're missing fingers). that's what makes it even worse. the retarded quarterback thing...well, that was good! the little thing he (largeman) says as they're about to enter the quarry (something about huffing turpentine)...that was good! oh, wait, that's about it.you know, zach braff is, i think, always a little too cute. but, he's likable. but, man, this is forced, pretentious, melodramatic (have you gotten that yet?), overly cute, overly everything. this movie is terrible. apparently, i'm outnumbered, as this waste of time is currently rated an 8.0.please, though, if you're looking for something truly poignant and subtle and unique do. not. rent. this. movie.

shot in my former home town by a couple of college kids, this movie centers around some freak named "luther". luther, recently paroled (revealed to us by an arguing parole board in one of the most laughably scenes of all time), runs amuck at the local kroger grocery by eating an old woman's neck with his metal teeth.luther runs to farm where he eats a guy, steals a car, ties up an old woman, and gets chased, and gets killed. oh, and the chick from the superboy tv show gets naked.

i'd chose either over this film. this film has been in my "must see" list for a while because people talked about it being "disturbing" and also the vhs box contains lots and lots of quotes from people saying how "amazing" it is, or how "as close as you can get to texas chainsaw massacre" and lines like that. but, sorry folks, i was disappointed big time. the idea is interesting, but the script is so underdeveloped that each character becomes a mistaken creation of evolution and people do indeed to the dumbest films in the film.that, in turn, takes away any credibility that the plot may have otherwise had. i couldn't believe how unnecessarily loooooong some "where is he, let's find him" sequences were. a few gory moments to please the gore fan, but they are so few that by the time we get to them there's no point. if luther's a geek, then the filmmakers must really be down on the food chain.

this isn't a very good movie, but it is easily the best troma studios film i have ever viewed. lloyd kaufman - the "brains" behind troma - isn't concerned with a good plot or even making a moderately entertaining film. his chief concern is making something bizarre. and his definition of bizarre oftentimes mirrors my definition of terrible cinema.in this film we have the titled character luther - whose favorite pastime isn't baseball, but biting the heads off of chickens - receiving his release from lockup. the board has deemed him rehabilitated despite the fact that he doesn't speak - he merely clucks like a chicken - and has a set of razorblade dentures at his disposal. of course, once luther is set free, he goes about causing mayhem, first at a grocery store and later at a farm house.violence: $$$$$ (lots of violence in this oftentimes tasteless flick. luther sinks his razorblade chompers into a poor elderly lady waiting at a bus stop and then spends the rest of the film terrorizing the mother and daughter at the farmhouse).nudity: $$$$$ (stacy haiduk delivers some noteworthy skin in his picture, as the former lois lane (i can't recall which superman edition she was from) gives us a shower scene followed by a romp in bed with her boyfriend - a guy who just doesn't have any chemistry with ms. haiduk. the extended shower scene footage in the dvd extras gives the viewer quite a bit more of stacy. she is quite something).story: $ (forgettaboutit!!!! whitey styles' screenplay may just be the worst ever written. the way in which luther is released from the asylum completely throws all credibility out the window. his dialogue is something that a pre-schooler might write and the actions he writes for his characters border on the absurd. it's as if styles spent ten years without human contact and completely forgot how people react in certain situations).acting: $$ (the film belongs to edward terry who actually does a decent job as the geek. he is quite menacing in a stupid barnyard fashion. joan roth as the mother does a super job in support but haiduk and her boyfriend's lack of chemistry made their roles awkward at best).

this movie tries its darndest to capture that classic bad canadian movie feel:"quirky" and obnoxious characters (a few); "quirky" town with "quirky" folk; a "quirky" coffee shop or restaurant (coffee shop here); lots of shots of canadian stuff for postcards (ocean stuff here); lots of mention of "gotta get out of this town"; downright booooring.and it succeeds on all counts.something to note, though. i couldn't figure out whether this movie was just trying to be post-northern exposure "quirky" comedy or something surreal like a drug-induced or psychotic hallucination. the editing of this movie jumped around nonsensically from one unrelated thing to another with zero pacing or motivation. not to mention the fact that half the time we didn't even know where we were jumping. take for instance, the very opening shots, of yelling teens in a car. who are they and what the h--- did they have to do with anything? and this sub - uh - plot (use that word plot loosely) concering kids that seem to span generations. i don't think they actually do, but the editing makes it look like they materialize from flashback, all of a sudden, to current time. huh? what did i miss?avoid. unless for laughs. or you want to try and trip out on the inept editing.

i couldn't help but laugh when i saw what the public could be made to think was email back in 1996. apparently email is an interactive discussion (similar to a chat) with lame voice synthesis reading every comment out loud. and some of the other "tech" aspects are also laugh-out-loud funny. i'd swear the "high tech" communications centre she has actually has a few commodore 64 monitors in it. almost like watching the movie hackers nowadays, i guess.despite the fact that for most of the movie the lead actress carries off the illusion of being disabled, the final part of the movie has an unexplained use of her legs which somehow i can't ignore. i mean, why include something so stupid? anyway, to sum up: the plot is pretty predictable, the acting bad, the killer quite guessable. but it can be amusing in a mystery science theatre 3000 kind of way i guess.

ok.. at the time of writing, 65 people voted for this movie, bringing it to a 5 out of 10 rating. my guess is that only the film crew voted. so i'm here to bring some justice to it all.never has a movie provoked the audience's intelligence more than this one. given, i laughed out loud quite a bit - but the movie/story absolutely didn't want me to.i've seen a lot of bad movies. a lot. but man, this one blows them all away.speaking '96 computers, ridiculous acting, and wheelchair chases - and we have young tarantinos who can't get their ideas financed. yup, life's a cruel joke.

after high school track & field athelete, laura remstead, dies of natural causes during a race (an event that is shown multiple times, in slow-motion none-the-less), an unknown killer is murdering all the people who were on that same aforementioned team close to graduation day (hence the name)in this laughably inept slasher flick.it brings absolutely nothing new (or even good) to the slasher table, instead opting to merely unleash the most god-awful song i've heard in quite some time with ' gangster rock' being played in a roller-disco party that went on far too long.eye candy: denise cheshire & linnea quigley get topless my grade: d-

the title for this review about sums up how i feel about this movie. i can't imagine what audience there would be for this thing, if not for the die-hard fan of 1980s slasher films who simply has to see -everything- from that era. otherwise, don't even waste your time on this.the story is similar to most films of its type: something awful happens to one of the characters in the opening scene, which inspires a bloodthirsty killer to go on a murderous rampage. been there, done that. truth be told, none of these '80s slashers were known for their originality, so i can't see the point in harping on the film simply for this.but where the film fails is in its suspense and murder sequences. i've seen some pretty scary slasher movies from the 1980s that had far lower budgets than this. this one just fails to create any real suspense. the director throws in some nice camera angles and some semi-professional directorial touches here and there, but they mean nothing if you're not frightened. the gore is pretty tame as well, so anyone who watches these things with the intention of seeing some cool 1980s makeup effects will be sadly disappointed.the movie manages to clunk along rather dully. honestly, the key ingredient to almost any slasher is the tight pacing--you have to keep things moving along swiftly and keep the murder set pieces staged at regular intervals, because, let's face it, we don't watch these things for the great characterization and stellar plots. but the pacing, whether due to the script or the editor, is all off. the murders are spaced out at odd intervals, leaving us with some long-winded scenes (no doubt meant to build "character") that serve only to bore you and leave you praying for the next kill (which, as i've said, usually isn't executed all that well anyway).as for the killer, don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening. he (or she?) wears a jogging suit, a fencing mask, and his (or her?) primary weapon is a sword. i bet the writer just wet himself over thinking he came up with an original, "cool" murder weapon, but the idea just comes off as impractical and silly. there's also not much emphasis placed on the "whodunnit' nature of the film, as if they either forgot or don't care to place any red herrings in the mix to throw us off.i have the sense that the people behind this were trying to make something decent and respectable, and at times, it shows their intentions were probably a bit more genuine in regards to making a quality film as opposed to countless other knockoff slashers from the era. but alas, the attempt fails for the most part. there is, however, some pretty good acting (at least, for this type of film). there is attempt at characterization, but none of it ends up meaning anything in the end, so...what a waste. here, all it manages to do is bog down the plot and make the murder sequences feel like they can't come soon enough.in the end, if you're really into these old '80s slashers, by all means, check it out, if only to say you've seen it. there's a completest in all of us. but don't expect to be blown away or anything. what we have here is a very mildly entertaining slasher movie that leaves no real impression at all.

this movie was sheer, slow, plodding torture. not being a fan of slasher films, and preferring classic horror, i may not be the best judge. slasher fans may enjoy this as an early entry into the slasher genre. i really would like the 90 minutes i spent watching this back. the only reasons to watch this are 1) a young vanna white (pre wheel of fortune) who has about 3 minutes of total screen time. 2) an early role by scream queen linnea quigley (with nudity), and legendary beauty ej peaker as the school secretary, who added a bit of humor and sex appeal. otherwise, an 80's band called felony makes an appearance, which while interesting, drags on way too long. just like the movie.....i had to keep checking how much time was left and couldn't wait to "graduate" to a better film.

for me, reviewing movies is an extension of my love of film--and of horror cinema, in particular. the reviews i've written thus far have been for films that i love, respect, and admire, and i have eagerly rewarded them with glowing accolades and perfect-ten ratings. a life-long horror movie fan, it is a tremendous pleasure for me to be able to share with others my thoughts and ideas about great horror films, and to, hopefully, have a hand in exposing people to movies they may not otherwise seek out. i only recently began reviewing films for the imdb, and it was my initial intention to concentrate only on my own personal favorites, examining those which i believe are of substance and of lasting value to the horror genre. however, the existence of films like "graduation day" is, without pun, a thorn in my side. completely devoid of any merit whatsoever, this 1981 hodgepodge of unformed ideas is amateurishly directed, poorly acted, and, in every sense, an unmitigated embarrassment to horror cinema. during the brief couple of years before and after this movie's release, we saw the appearance of domestic (and canadian) films such as "halloween ii," "prom night," "terror train," "madman," "my bloody valentine," "the prowler," "just before dawn," "final exam," and "hell night," among others. these films, though of varying degrees of quality, clearly strove to achieve something in terms of story line, plotting, acting, direction, and overall tone. not every movie released during this bountiful season of the slasher era would be of the artistic merit or commercial success of the original "halloween" or "friday the 13th," but these films were all well-made and clearly contributed to the ongoing development of horror cinema. "graduation day," an abysmal farce about a masked killer stalking members of a high school track team, was directed by herb freed, whom one can only hope will never again attempt to besmirch the horror genre with such a travesty. the task of creating worthwhile horror films is best left to those who have a genuine love and respect for the genre. this movie fails miserably on every possible level, not the least of which are dreadfully wooden performances, dime-store special effects, an irritating musical score, and, most of all, a story lacking even the slightest hint of tension or suspense. a pointless exercise in how to waste film, "graduation day" is an utter disgrace to horror cinema.

"graduation day" - i bought this movie this past week and waited for some time where i could kick back and relax and watch some "good" 80's slasher gems, i got this and "xtro" to watch, never seen any of them. i just watched it and realized my outdoor speakers were on also. i only imagine what my neighbors thought when "felony" came on to sing their one 10 minute hit? i'm sure it was loud and i'm sure they think i'm weird, with that and the chainsaw sound and screaming from other movies.this was a pretty sub par slasher movie, no suspense, no story, some cool deaths, almost seemed on the amateur side, i usually like movies like that, but it just didn't click with me, now i will watch "xtro" for the 1st time and have a margarita!dj eric austin tx

pretty lame and awful slasher about someone killing the members of a high school track team after their star runner dies during a meet.christopher george gives a hilariously over-the-top performance as the track team's coach. i don't think anyone has ever taken track and field as seriously as chris does here - not even in the olympics. it's a typically divine cg performance, and if you are a fan of the man/the legend, you should run right out and grab a copy.but we watch slashers for the murders (you know it's true), not the performances, and graduation day fails to deliver on most counts (there is one really good kill). true horror only comes during a performance by the band "felony". never heard of 'em? watch graduation day and find out why.

this film is slow. this film is cheap. this film makes friday the 13th look like a best picture nominee. the acting is crap. the special effects are crap. no one dies for like 40 minutes and all the people do is act badly. the only thing that saves it is it's ability to make you laugh at all the stupidity going on. the funniest part is watching the heroine "fight off" the attacker. she supposed to be trained but she fights like a 70 year old. they spend pointless scenes on people who don't die and no scenes on people who do die to the point where you don't even know why they are dieing. i love slashers but this is just crap.

first and foremost i wish to aim a big & mean middle-finger towards the troma dvd-distribution crew, who were actually stupid enough to reveal the identity of this movie's pivot killer on the back of the cover! the synopsis just randomly mentions who's the person responsible for the massacre on graduation day, for christ's sake! i don't care how terrible or how predictable an 80's slasher can be; just mentioning who did it ruins the whole point! so, a word of advise in case you also purchase the troma double-feature containing "graduation day" and "nymphoid barbarian in dinosaur hell", do not  repeat do not  turn the box around and read the back! watching the film is already a painful experience, but reading the back would really spoil everything.now, as for the actual the actual movie oh boy! personally i'm a fan of the cinematic 'work' of herb freed. well actually, i don't really know whether i should admire himor pity him! all herb's films are pretty bad & amateurish, but at the same time you can tell his direction is spirited and full of good intentions! unlike with "haunts" and "beyond evil", he followed a contemporary popular genre trend and tried to cash in on the typical high-school slasher films. just to offer a minimum of originality, all the victims in "graduation day" are promising athletes and members of the same track of coach george michaels (awesome name! i guess herb freed is a fan of "wham!"). during the opening credits, we witness how a young girl dramatically dies on the field, moments after winning a 30 seconds running race. the debate of whether or not her coach and fellow track team-members weren't pushing her physical limits too much is raised, but one particular individual goes one step further and begins to sadistically kill everyone he/she considers responsible for laura's death. what a demented little movie! the script must be one of the most incoherent ones i ever beheld, with loads of red herrings and sub plots that go absolutely nowhere and death sequences that are almost too cheesy for words! there's a bloke impaled by a football attached to a javelin, others are decapitated with an absurdly big sword and the unluckiest bastard of them all even falls to his death on a disguised bed of spikes! herb concentrates on the ingeniousness & the fast pacing of the killings so much that he totally forgets about the sub plots he introduced earlier in the film! for example, laura's sister returns home from her military training and seemly starts an investigation regarding the circumstances of her death. halfway through the movie, however, her character hardly appears in the movie anymore. also, the girls' stepfather is referred to as a violent drunkard but this interesting given immediately gets ignored as well. instead of carefully mounted suspense and misleading red herrings, we're served disco-dancing & roller-skating sequences and  of course  numerous images of unattractive 80's chicks stripping their tops off. despite being really bad, "graduation day" could count on a respectable cast! christopher george ("grizzly", "city of the living dead") greatly stars as the demanding coach, carmen argenziano ("when a stranger calls", "the accused") briefly appears as a police detective investigating the rising number of missing teenagers and michael pataki ("dead & buried", "dracula's dog") has a very amusing part as the school's stressed out principal. the teenage beauties on duty include linnea quigley and vanna white. heck, for some horror fans, the presence of these two ladies is enough reason already to count "graduation day" among the most quintessential slashers of the early 80's. it's a dumb film, but entertainment and chuckles are guaranteed!

an interesting slasher film with multiple suspects.includes typical girl flashing her breasts (denise cheshire) as she changes into her swimsuit, creepy suspect - any one of them could be doing the deed, expected breast baring to get a passing grade (linnea quigley), a very unusual forward pass, more bare breasts, a track and field event that will not be in the summer olympics, and a ghoulish secret.it all comes to a crashing ending. no, there's more. won't this guy die? i bet anne (patch mackenzie) doesn't plan any more visits home anytime soon.if you like teen slasher films, can you possible be a pervert, even if all the actresses are over 18?

after their star cross-country runner dies after a race, the members of a track team are stalked and killed by a mysterious masked murderer seeking vengeance for the girl's death.from the beginning of this film, it was quite obvious it was not going to be very good (at least as far as true quality goes). the 'dramatic' track race at the end of the introduction scene was one of the least believable sporting events i've ever seen in a film. it would seem that the winner of the race had never actually run before in her entire life. not just run track. . . but, run at all. ever. from there, we get a horribly unrealistic female navy member who was breaking numerous appearance rules with her jewelry and make-up, not to mention the fact that her hair was hanging loose onto her collar while in uniform. ridiculously awkward camera angles, pathetically done gore effects, and acting that ranged from frighteningly over-the-top to boringly under done (all in one actor, mind you) all help to make this film one of the most unintentionally hilarious horror films ever made. on the other hand, the writing wasn't all that terrible and the story was actually okay. but, the direction was horrible, made worse by offensively bad cinematography. the acting ranged from acceptable to just plain abysmal. regardless of all the embarrassingly bad elements, however, there's something here, whether it be cheese or something else that i can't figure out, that makes the film extremely enjoyable and very worthy of a watch. maybe it was just vanna white.obligatory slasher elements:- violence/gore: death scenes were fun enough, but the gore was just awful: blood squirts from impossible angles, no actual gashes or wounds from knives, etc. but, this film has the first 'death by football' scene i've ever seen.- sex/nudity: there was a bit of nudity (i mean, linnea quigley is in it, after all), and some overly horny high schoolers, but nothing to excess.- cool killer(s): if you think leather gloves, stop watches, track suits, and fencing masks are cool, this one is for you.- scares/suspense: not really any at all. there is one moment that takes place in the girls' locker room that i was preparing myself to be scared at. . . but, it just led to some typical stupidity and was ruined for me.- mystery: a little, but if you can't figure out the killer's identity about 20 minutes into the film, then i'm not too sure about your powers of deduction.- awkward dance scene: there's a great impromptu jam session ("graduation day blues") with a guitar & harmonica that leads to some awesome 80s bopping. this is followed shortly by some kind of weird blend of 70s disco and 80s break dancing that was probably the scariest part of the film.final verdict: 4/10. don't take it too seriously and you might enjoy it (just like most everything else troma touches).-ap3-

six months after high-school sprinter laura dies during a race, a killer begins to murder the rest of the track team using a variety of sports equipment as weapons: that's the daft plot of early 80s slasher graduation day, a lacklustre addition to the genre that offers very little in the way of style, originality or decent gore.what it does deliver, however, are some stunningly awful musical interludes, a few familiar faces (including an early appearance from scream-queen linnea quigley), and a smattering of nudity (a prerequisite of any slasher movie!).so forget the death scenesthey're lame and rather bloodlessand instead enjoy the movie's more memorably crap elements: the rapid editing that can induce migraines and epileptic seizures; the roller disco, which is accompanied by a prolonged heavy rock song, ' gangster rock', as performed by the unforgettably awful felony; an impromptu jamming session by the school's students; christopher george hamming it up as chief red-herring coach michaels; and the cheesy music teacher who letches after his female students (who, for some reason, find him quite irresistible?!?!).towards the end of the film, the action picks up a little, with the discovery of the slaughtered kids' bodies under the bleachers, and a quite twisted scene featuring laura's corpse in her cap and gown, but it all comes way to late in the day to save this film from mediocrity.

next stop on our journey through the calender-slasher scene is... oh yes, "graduation day"! all of those seniors, just brimming with possibility and ready to venture out into the real world and become adults. that is, however, if they can make it to graduation without having to tangle with the campus lunatic who's running around, gouging the life out of students with his fencing sword... yeah, it all stems from a the high school track star who drops dead from a blood clot during a race and a year later, her older sister returns home from the navy for graduation. the track coach holds the blame and broods in his demoted position in shop-class while the girl's boyfriend still mourns her death a year later... all of these characters are prime candidates for "serial slasher of the year" and you just have to sit through this movie until the end to find out who-done-it. "graduation day" is fun, though it isn't spell-bindingly original by any means and there aren't a whole lot of memorable demises, but there is enough going on to keep you mildly entertained. like linnea quigley screwing the music teacher and getting busted with a joint, 30 year-old actors playing teenagers, and of course... rollerdisco! gotta love that crap! you can do a lot worse than "graduation day", kiddies...

a high school track star falls dead after winning a race; shortly after, her older sister (patch mackenzie) returns home in time to notice that all of her sister's track team members are disappearing. who could the killer be? you may not care enough to want to find out.crude, cheap, amateurish slasher is just about completely worthless, although top-billed christopher george (as the nasty, hard-driving track coach) tries to give it a lift with an intense performance. not even the gore is worth mentioning. the whole thing is lame from beginning to end, starting with opening the movie to a track meet montage set to disco music, and the casting of e.j. peaker, once a co-star of the movie "hello, dolly" as a character named "blondie"! that's right, "blondie". this may mean that we aren't supposed to take the movie seriously, but in any case it's a shambles.it's the kind of routine slasher junk that makes the "friday the 13th" movies look like works of art in comparison.the only point of interest may be wanting to see an early film appearance by vanna white, of all people.2/10

i've got to say that i'm not a massive fan of troma films. granted, i've only seen three of them (or four including this one), but two (blood sucking freaks and mothers' day) are widely reputed to be the best, which leads me to believe that all the others aren't worth seeing. that would certainly seem to be the case with graduation day, which is a troma take on the over-popular eighties slasher. while the film is never particularly bad (given the type of film), it's never particularly good either; and by the end, all i could think about was 'why did i bother watching this?'. anyway, the plot sees some girl die on a race track, and shortly thereafter; more people start dying. naturally, there are a few possible suspects; but it's hard to really care about anything that happens. of course, in slasher terms; it's the gore that is most important, and given troma's track record where the red stuff is concerned, i was expecting buckets of it. there are some decent kill scenes, and some of them are gory; but it's never very shocking, which really just makes this another dreary slasher based on a celebratory event on the american calendar. it's worth noting that there's a small role in this film for sleaze queen linnea quigley, but the rest of the cast aren't worth mentioning. the direction, plot and its execution are all very mundane; and i will say that unless you're a big troma fan or someone that wants to track down every slasher ever made; don't bother with this film.

high school female track star dies of a blood clot after winning a race with the community in an uproar against coach george michaels(christopher george playing him as a major butt-head who is very demanding of the athletes under his watch). he'll be canned after school lets out providing the flick with his motive as a possible killer. some twisted psychopath in sweats(much the same as what michaels is often seen wearing), using a stop watch to time his executions, murders the members of the track team the dead female runner was a part of. soon disturbed parents call principal guglione(michael pataki)wondering why their children didn't come home after a prom party. inspector halliday(carmen argenziano)begins snooping around campus at worried parents' request. instantly a beleaguered michaels becomes a prime suspect after the body of a gymnast is found in a locker. ensign anne(patch mackenzie)returned home from her base in guam to receive her dead track sister's diploma and soon confronts the killer herself in the climactic chase scene. kevin badger(e danny murphy)is the weary boyfriend of the lost track star.rather leisurely paced slasher spreads out the death sequences quite a bit trying to mix humor within and rather failing miserably. low-quality kill sequences only increase the laughter such as a sword embedded within a football thrown into the stomach of a football player or a pair of garden shears used to behead a poor soul taking a leak. linnea quigley has an amusing role as horny student dolores who sleeps with her music teacher for a higher grade and always chases after a male stud(the recipient of the garden shears before he has a chance to bed dolores outside of the prom party). vanna white has an early role here as a ditsy blonde who discovers the dead gymnast's body in the locker. virgil frye has a silly role as an inept officer.

"graduation day" is a result of the success of "friday the 13th." both of those films are about creative, bloody murders, rather than suspense. if you enjoy that type of film, i'd recommend "graduation day." if not, i wouldn't. there's nothing new here, just the same old killings.even though i've given the film a 4 out of 10, i will say that it's not a repulsive film. it is watchable if your curious about it, just not creative.

"graduation day" was released in may 1981, during the height of the slasher film craze. earlier that year, fans had been subjected to flicks like "my bloody valentine", "just before dawn", "friday the 13th part 2", and "the burning" and theaters still were expecting flicks such as "halloween ii", "the prowler", and "happy birthday to me". i have seen all of these films, and out of all the popular 1981 slashers "graduation day" is by far the worst.what "graduation day" amounts to is an exercise in poor, low-budget film-making with bad acting, bad writing, pointless characters, pointless scenes, unneeded nudity, cheesy dialogue, and an experiment in editing that didn't work so well. and who could forget the classic 80's disco music that plays throughout the film (the opening scene's music is only rivaled by the music that plays during a chase scene). however when renting a movie like this a person should be aware that those details will be in this film. so why isn't "graduation day" considered a classic like "halloween", "friday the 13th", "a nightmare on elm street", "my bloody valentine", "the burning", or "prom night"? why do fans still seek those films but disregard this without care?where slasher films need to succeed above all other areas is in the pacing. there is nothing worse than a slow moving slasher, and "graduation day" moves pretty slow. the most aggravating part is that there are plenty of opportunities to speed things up; there are numerous pointless characters who are introduced and who are never allowed the chance to be a suspect in the murders or be a victim. there's a sleazy teacher, a stressed principal, a cunning secretary, a dopey school security guard, a clueless detective, an alcoholic step father, a mindless grandmother, and a mom to an earlier victim still grieving. all of these characters could have a motive to killing or a reason to getting killed, but they are all wasted. the worst part is that the story still focuses on them, and at times designates entire scenes just to flesh out their character. but for what?what does amaze me about "graduation day" and its small fanbase is that people aren't more amazed by the death scenes. fans go wild for death scenes like the raft massacre in "the burning", the washing-machine death in "my bloody valentine", the kabob death in "happy birthday to me", the upside down death in "friday the 13th part 3", and hot tub death in "halloween ii", and even the car hood death in "madman". but where is the respect for some truly unique (even though cheesy) deaths in "graduation day". one victim gets impaled right through the jugular with a fencing sword, while another gets that sword thrown at them like a javelin. the best death includes spikes under a landing mat. why aren't these deaths famous among the genre like the deaths in more popular slasher films?"graduation day" tries hard to be a great and unique film, but there is just an element of logic and pacing missing that really ruins the whole experience. its not the worst of its kind (try checking out "don't go in the woods... alone") and there is a bit of suspense, plus it delivers just what fans are looking for (blood, gore, nudity, sex, and nostalgia) but "graduation day" will not be remembered as one of the all time greatest slasher films ever made. it's not a question of budget - almost all slashers have a low-budget - however it is a question of ideas, creativity, and craftsmanship. that's all any type of movie making is...recommended for hardcore slasher fans. general horror fans might get a little bored, and people who don't have much interest in horror at all should steer clear. it's not the worst slasher film ever made, but its a long way from being the best.

while i am a long-time shatner fan (since we used to watch trek re-runs over the dinner hour in the early '70s), i cannot think of any possible reason why he wanted to do this film, whether for personal development or business reasons. did he lose a bet?as a movie fan, i like to appreciate the bad films along with the great ones. but "shoot or be shot" doesn't have any flair or funny bits, unintentional or not.while unrated, there were no objectionable scenes (blink or you'll miss it nudity, cartoonish gunfire "violence" with the endless bullet gunfights), so one is led to believe that the producers merely wanted to save the fee required to get the mpaa to rate it. this will make its way to cable with barely 10 seconds edited out.of the eight people that were in the theatre with us, four of them left mid-way, muttering statements like "this is stupid".shatner plays an escaped mental patient who has been denied release because he views himself as a screenwriter. the examination board stamps his request "insane". he runs into a group of z-grade moviemakers who "shoot on video because its 80% cheaper than film" and decides to force them to shoot his script at gunpoint. there are a few minor subplots that develop some of the secondary characters, but for the most part, that is the whole movie.if you want to spend 90 minutes on a shatner "art" film, see "free enterprise" instead, it is a much better film.

some of the secondary actors try, really hard. and camera shots in the desert are quite lovely. otherwise, this film is horrible.william shatner's character, harvey, is an amateur screenwriter. he's also a psychopath, a man who quite literally escapes from a mental institution. is the point of this film that amateur screenwriters are psychopaths? harvey will do anything to get his script read and turned into a movie, even if that means taking a film crew hostage. do amateur screenwriters ... grovel? maybe they do.the film's setup is way too long. we don't get to the point of the story until well into the second half. the first half darts and flits among assorted characters."shoot or be shot" is touted as a comedy, but i found it totally not funny. dialogue contains no subtext. none of the characters are believable as real people. they're all stick figures that perform "action" in a way that resembles cartoon characters. indeed, the film is basically a cartoon for adults: silly, inane, birdbrained.i can understand why some actors are in this film. they need the money or the exposure. but what are insiders shatner and harry hamlin doing here? maybe shatner wants more comedy roles. is this the best he can do? is hamlin that desperate for money? he used to be a respected actor. what happened?even though the story is supposed to be a satire, it comes across more as a put-down of amateur screenwriters. maybe that wasn't the intent. but that's certainly how the film can be interpreted. as such, the script was very, very poorly written.

uggh! hanna-barbera of the 60s and 70s! what lousy and unwatchable cartoons that were thrust upon us by these hacks! it's a shame really, as in the 1940s and 1950s "hanna-barbera" meant quality--because they produced so many wonderful tom and jerry cartoons. however, with the major cost-cutting efforts of the late 1950s, cartoons in general began to look pretty poor and budgets were slashed. in fact, william hanna and joseph barbera were fired by mgm and replaced by a team of czech animators who had never even seen the original cartoons! so, in the late 50s, the team was out of work and decided "if you can't beat 'em, join 'em"--and began producing horrid little cartoons themselves--with horrible animation, backgrounds and writing.it's unfortunate, but the team's production of crappy cartoons worked too well---making them rich and the most successful producers of cartoons of the 60s and 70s. during this time, again and again, bad production values was their norm and a long list of very forgettable cartoons were created. in this case, the amazingly bad inch high private eye--a completely unfunny and stupid idea. if you want to know what the show was about, the title says it all.rotten to the core and strong evidence that the production team had total contempt for us kids!

i was wondering when someone would try turning that whole matamoros mess into a goreporn pic. anyroad, here's a few things i learned about mexico from watching this film.~all mexican women are super hot - remember that little desert town in unearthed? yeah, well, this must be it's mexican sister city. don't even bother with the hookers, just put a few smooth moves on the hot bartender. she'll be just as hot as the prostitutes and probably doesn't have any kids as well! ~half of mexico is controlled by insane satan-worshiping palo mayombe cultists. ¡ay, caramba! the other half, as everyone here in the u.s. knows, is run by drug dealers. fortunately, this doesn't much interfere with the sex-tourisim trade and our ultra-low wage factories down there.~mexican cops are useless. don't go to them. go to the nearest occult bookstore and ask the hot chick behind the counter what happened to your vanished friend. she'll be way more help than the cops.~when you're being gruesomely tortured by the aforementioned bloodthirsty cultists, don't go reciting the psalms or any part of the bible, really. you'll just mess up the mojo.

this movie clearly has an agenda, which could be summed up like this: never, never cross the border (either physical or metaphorical). let's shun everything that's on the other side with a wall or a fence or something else, let's pretend all "gringos" are evil, satanic, or drug dealers. all that is outside one's country's border (and specially us borders) is dangerous, malevolent and people there will hate you, or envy you or try to steal you or something else. the "based on true events" is only a perverse tag that can be pinned on anything to give it some aura of credibility or, in this case, just to help pushing the film's ideology down some naïve throats out there. the perversity of the film lies in the fact that it reduces countries, people and all else into very black and white stereotyped categories: mexicans into disgusting people, mexican police into a bunch of corrupt cops, republicans into the right-wing morons, democrats into almost hippie humanists and so forth. is there anything good about the film? i hardly think so, but may be you think differently.

ok, if you like yer monster moovies sullen, stiff, starchy, and thunderously dull, but with lots of throttling, then head right for "lady frankenstein", a stagy, costumy italian corpse-walker. joseph cotten("citizen kane")plays the crusty old baron himself, and must have really needed to make that condo payment. sexy sarah bay, who has played in cow-ntless european b-films, usually as rosabla neri, including "hercules against the moon men", plays his ambitious daughter, a surgeon in a ruffled prom dress. cotten makes an ugly, big-headed monster (cud it really be that much effort to make a nice one??), who immediately throttles cotten(who took his royalty check & ran), and wanders around throttling everyone in sight. tania(bay) decides to switch the brain of her lover(who is old and wrinkly) with the brain of a younger man (who is "beautiful", but stooopid), in order to make another monster to throttle the first monster cotten made, who is wandering around throttling people. well, after much exposition, and some throttling, the 2 monsters throttle each other for a bit, tania stabs the first monster in the back, and then has sex in the flaming ruins of her mansion with the second monster - only to have him throttle her! doh! there is so much throttling going on that you almoost overlook the fact that the film is about as exciting as a dead carp, and mooves just as quickly. the alpha video version i saw for this review was heavily edited, and one wonders cow much nekkid people were chopped out, not that it would have improved the film much. director von theurmer previously helmed a variety of grade z euro-trash, including "jungle warriors", "island of the dead"(as mel wells), and "the crucified girls of san ramon". the moocow says avoid this corpse of a film, and find something that mooves at moore of a full...throttle. ;=8)

congratulations to christina ricci for making this movie and putting her mojo behind this important subject and trying to make a great film. ricci is my favorite actress: she is so gifted, so natural, her reactions are perfect and so is the energy she constantly radiates, which gives credence to the often misapplied term "star." the film misses its mark for lots of various reasons, but perhaps most notably for the story's seeming unadaptability to the screen in making it a compelling narrative...more on that later. the cast at first glance is excellent, but come to think of it, jessica lang as the jewish mother is too protestant and not exactly right, ann hetch doesn't come close to showing the compassion and dedication of the psychiatrist from the book, and when your making a movie, how can you justify saying no to anne heche and jessica lange? but the real problems are in the film's construction: first in the failure to elicit any kind of lasting sympathy for the elizabeth wurtzle character, and second to say anything meaningful regarding the all too common and horrible situation that this poor girl finds herself in. unfortunately do to the flashback construction, lizzy merely comes off as certainly more affected teenager than most, but not nearly as devastatingly ill as she comes off in the book. this is a major problem. this story had to be told from beginning to end and from the therapist's couch. she is only eight or nine when her depression starts due to devastating social factors, both society and the home, and this is a crucial point in not only eliciting the proper sympathy for her but also of the gravitas of her case. she is so talented, and such a vulnerable and disaffected spirit so early on, that one's heart can't help but reach out to her due to her victimization. this is missed on the film.ultimately one has to come to terms with what the film is trying to say: it is a biopic of one severely affected girl, but also it is a film about a nation who can't get its act together; that is very clear in the book but interestingly not in the film where the chosen at harvard are even more messed up than the average college enrollee. the film finally isn't able to get either of these messages across compellingly, and that's too bad. is prozac a good thing or is it a bad thing, or a mixed blessing or a seeming necessity in a country in which so many people can't function without a chemical crutch? these are tough and challenging concepts to work with and the writing does not really attempt to address any of them in a more or less engaging way. the challenger disaster is an interesting image to symbolize a dysfunctional america, but that doesn't have the effect it's suppose to have due to the crosscutting and insufficient earlier development of controlling themes.ricci's performance is tight and heartfelt, and one of the best of her acting career.michele williams is also superb in her role.

i seldom see a film with such a cast, such a potentially strong story and based on a bestselling book that has been this weak and to some extent unwatchable... the premise of a story reads like a brent easton ellis novel - a lot of drugs, hopelessness and self-induced tragedy as a young elisabeth wurtzel (played by christina ricci) tries to cope with being a suicidal loser, that can't seem to accept that she is actually living a good life and that basically she is pathetic for being such a baby... christina ricci is not only playing a tragic personae, but also a tragic actor, whose sobbing and screeching for the most part of the movie actually make you want to shout - kill yourself already and let us get to the credits rolling... the director is of no help as he supplies absolutely no pace and the story feels so disjointed you have no idea what this damn girl is actually on about. the director apparently was on prozac when directing this imitation of a movie and hence let the movie go on autopilot making it an unbearable mess.the only redeeming features are a sympathetic jason biggs, as wurtzel's boyfriend (who thankfully decided to dump the self-indulgent egocentric egomaniac) and an unbelievably good jessica lange as the cry-babies mother. lange apparently can not be brought down by terrible script, directing and dire co-actors. pure class.i don't know if this is really who wurtzel is or was, but the film has successfully made me totally uninterested in her writings.in the end i finished watching this movie and instantly started to think: ok. time to watch something, that actually is about real problems...

five fingers relies heavily on barbaric, shock value hollywood tactics to elicit apparently a positive movie-going response. this is where this movie fails throughout, primarily because it is too graphic to be taken seriously. i was repulsed and disgusted that five fingers was even made, and essentially had to force myself to continue watching it. torture in and of itself is gruesome. even the sounds coming from a room where someone is being tortured are gruesome. but obviously the makers of this stinker of a movie felt that was not enough. it had to go way beyond what was needed, and simply and effectively ruined any chances this movie had of making some sort of valid point. for this reason, this movie came across as nothing more than being self-gratifying. five fingers also pretty much relegates itself to a b-movie status solely by its indulgence on manipulation of time. in other words we are shown the present and then the past is revealed in snippets. this is a little bit of a twist of the normal hollywood manipulation of time. whereas the viewer normally is shown page 95 in a 100 page script as the beginning of the movie, and then the rest of the flick is essentially explaining the ending, five fingers is dedicated to flashing back, which gets quite tiring by the end of the movie. overall, five fingers made me feel stupid for watching the whole movie, because torture is obviously obscene, and it certainly was not necessary to resort to graphic mutilation to make this point. i am surprised that dick cheney did not make a guest cameo appearance at the end as some sort of torture superhero. this movie is a perfect example of what happens when an important topic falls into the hands of greedy, mindless dolts.

- contains 1 spoiler, market with: ***** -not presenting itself as yet another remake of "the interview", five fingers actually is. alas, besides maybe the hardship of physical torture, it never adds anything to it's predecessor's accomplishment in terms of suspense, plot or performances. in fact, five fingers never gets anywhere near its level. what i found to be in particular painful to watch wasn't the torture itself, but the way martijn (ryan philippe) acted out his ordeal. to me it looked as if philippe tried too hard to get his accent right and it made his performance glibly amateur which in turn even dragged down the performance of an otherwise great colm meaney. phillipe's accent btw, being far from anything near dutch, sounded more like eastern european. besides the acting of philippi(which to my surprise turned from poor to actually decent towards the end) there is the matter of the flashbacks with the hackneyed dutch scenery. (if these scenes were set in switzerland they would have had the cast eat cheese on mountaintops with endless pastures with grazing cows wearing expensive timepieces). scenery aside, the way these flashbacks pushed the plot didn't work for me at all. it made it being served like french fries at a drive-in and caused the build-up of suspense to flatline.admittedly the movie did become more enjoyable as phillipe's acting improved but i couldn't help being annoyed every now and then with scenes that were just too implausible. e.g.: ************ start spoilerat some point (after days) philippe is almost tenderly washed by the female terrorist. this only to be followed by the brute severing of yet another finger. why give the guy a wash if he's in for a torture? and the severing of that last finger seemed to only serve the title of this flick anyway, i mean, he was practically begging to have it knifed off. didn't make sense************ end spoilerwhat ultimately kept me watching was the performance of fishburn who once again proved to be a brilliant actor but who also had the best part of the script to work with.all in all one is just far better off seeing "the interview" with that other matrix-icon: hugo weaving. and when you do, i'm confident you won't find this review that disagreeable.3.5/10"the interview", 1998 www.imdb.com/title/tt0120714/

it's complete nonsense. i've studied nazism and read many manuscripts from the day - the "parallels" use most of the classic debased apocryphal myths of nazism and then compare it with complete specious generalizations about what constitute 1/3 of the planet. it's crafted for an audience of polly-anna complacency who diet heavily on spoon-fed gibberish, horribly thought out arguments, irrational conclusions, fallacious ideas, and nonsensical logic.who made this hit peace? easy.when all is said and done; que bono? that is, who benefits, in the long run?you don't. you sacrifice money and rights. muslims don't, they get our bombs. try again. answer this, and you've unlocked a major door.

well, at least we have to acknowledge the big hollywood horror-producers are finally getting smarter and more perceptive. instead of patiently waiting to buy the rights of asian horror hits and subsequently remake them in america, they now discovered they could simply hire the asian directors and assign them to make their brand new ghost story directly in the states. that's like killing two birds with one stone; way to go guys! "the messengers" is pretty much identical to every other supernatural chiller that came out of the oriental countries ever since "ringu". roughly translated, this means it's a boring, overlong and entirely gore-free film, but it does feature copious amounts of false scares and embarrassingly weak "did we scare you yet?" moments. the pang brothers (danny & oxide) previously made the extremely overrated "the eye" and it sort of is a tradition for them to build up a story with clues and hints towards a point where it becomes nearly impossible to meet the expectations of their curious audiences, yet they don't seem eager to alter their formula any time soon. and they're also unscrupulous enough to recycle the same old & repetitive ghost topics over and over again. restless spirits of the previous inhabitants trapped in the walls of a remote countryside farm? the protagonist family torn apart by unprocessed traumas from the past, so they first have to restore faith and trust in each other? give me a break! throw in a videotape and a seven-days-curse, why don't you? even the attempts to make you jump in your seat are too déjà-vu and won't scare anyone over the age of 7. slamming doors, filthy & gradually larger growing stains on the walls, ghostly appearances, noises coming from the cellar... the endless overuse of cheap tricks like this is almost becoming insulting to horror fans. "the messengers" revolves on a family on their way to a new life in the country as the growers of sunflowers. the family situation is kind of dysfunctional since a personal tragedy (which doesn't get revealed until late in the film) caused their youngest son to stop talking and the parents to distrust their revolting teenage daughter. soon after, the children experience strange presences in remote farmhouse, but they don't manage to convince their parents to leave. that's pretty much concludes the entire film. little ben sees things but he can't talk and jessica repeatedly gets attacked by supernatural forces but nobody listens to her. the basic premise of "the messagers" is very derivative of stanley kubrick's immortal classic "the shining", only it lacks the constantly ominous atmosphere and disturbing tone. the script takes itself far too seriously even though it's fairly easy to predict the final denouement and the total absence of violence and bloodshed is unforgivable. at least "the eye" delivered some genuine shocks in the end, whereas the happy happy joy joy ending of "the messengers" is just pathetic. the only positive elements i can think of are the beautiful rural filming locations, the adequate editing job and the promising young acting talents (and beauty) kristen stewart. and there's an uncanny, but sadly underdeveloped supportive role for william b. davis.

lord protector is kiddie fare, but for whose kids? obviously shot for television or stv, this amateurish rehash krull has several stock characters -- a magician, an assassin, a warrior, a scientist -- on the trail of something or other in order to defeat the dark forces about to be unleashed on their planet. badly written, acted and staged in available california locations like municipal parks and a ranch, lord protector has nothing to recommend it, not even as a time waster. jay underwood is the only "name" actor, and most people, especially the intended audience of five year olds, are not likely to remember him from such ancient disney fare as not quite human. a no-name actor playing a magician in an ill-fitting silver wig at least plays it with tongue planted firmly in cheek, while those around him act as if they are in a dinner theater production of king lear. i was hoping at least for a decent action or special effects sequence. alas, the action sequences are pathetically staged and the few special effects are those old fashioned painted-over cartoon gags we used to see in 1950s and 1960s fantasy flicks, like bert gordon's the magic sword. the filmmakers planned a sequel that mercifully never came to be. often, such cheap hollywood back-lot productions use a combination of legit and porn actors. i kept myself occupied during the film's seemingly interminable running time, trying to figure which was which in this one. i didn't have much luck.

i have spent the last 5 years in the entertainment business and most recently find myself working for the company that made this movie, which is a real pity, because i like these folks, i just can't believe anyone could possibly make anything as bad as this?!!!! this was crap from every possible angle. from camera work to dialogue to acting to costumes and production design was one of the worst films i have ever seen! the actors in this film looked like they had been taken straight off of a porn that was being shot in the san fernando valley and put on a set with an even less talented crew.i just can't get over the fact that i am sitting on some of the best material i have ever read and contacts within the industry that could help me make my dream a reality and have hit every roadblock possible? yet the folks behind this spectacle of a film have no problems putting it together and in fact, sleep well after it is released.life, what a trip!

i can't even describe it. it's the worst movie i've ever seen (i'm being a nice guy when i call it movie).just another big-budget-made-to-someone-who-doesn't-like-to-think-much.it's not even scary. it's revolting when there are great movies that never reach the big screen and then comes this..."thing" to trick movie fans. i guess big producers make whatever they want.just get a big producer, hot chicks (allthough horrible actresses) and a ton of horror movie clichés and cook it for a week or so, and you'll get "the nun".and i thought bad boys 2 was horrible!!!!

i can only say this: ee03128 from portugal, i couldn't say it better. the worst movie i've ever seen... and i've seen lots of crap! when i read you comment i thought only about the thoughts i had while watching the movie. when i saw who was one of the script writers i understood it. balagueró uses the same tricks in all his movies. and his scripts are not much better either. and, of course, in barcelona we have tons of temples and churches around the city so we can keep cursed nuns to scare young americans coming on vacations. please, be serious! and i do not want to talk about the quality of the actors... there is something remarkable too. it is fair to recognize it. compared to the usual level, all the spanish actors use a fairly good english

the nun is a revenge picture whereby a very strict nun is killed by her rebellious trailer trash charges and comes back years later to get even when the now adults visit their old school. story line is predictable in spades and will hold no surprises as it slowly winds its way to the end. it is a screamer of a movie with passable acting and a below average script and screenplay. much of the special effects are low grade and there is almost zero believability in the final battle. still, if you look past these there is some suspense and acting jewels. if you like senseless cookie cutter screamers, you'll like this, otherwise you should pass.

i looked forward to seeing this movie, because the trailer made it look so cool. but the fact is that this movie is boring, and totally muddled. there is no plot, and half the movie is fast flashing shots from football games. zoomed in shots, that gives you no overview of the games. i was constantly looking at the timer, to see when the movie was over!there's only one good thing about this movie. the sound!! the soundtrack is awesome! .............don't expect anything from this movie.

this noisy, dizzying football film from director oliver stone seems to have everyone in the cast - well, everyone except william h. macy, who could have tackled the role played by mr. stone, the team doctors, or the "fruitcake" selling cereal. if you're a fan of the foul-mouthed, there are some great, profanity-laden knock-down, drag-out, put-down phrases you can try-out on two-faced friends and way-ward lovers. the film is sometimes good as lively background party atmosphere, especially during the first two hours; it even features some mtv-styled music video scenes.** any given sunday (12/16/99) oliver stone ~ al pacino, cameron diaz, jamie foxx, dennis quaid

another lame attempt to make a movie "gritty" and "thought provoking"- whatever the hell that means. they have al pacino say a lot of words like - "television killed football." yeah whatever. this is another movie that showcases oliver stone's delusions of grandeur. if stone is trying to show us that football will be our downfall or something, why does he insist on romanticizing the sport with his stilted camera movements and kid rock songs? he even throws cameron diaz into the fray for purely aesthetic reasons. it's a shame that diaz and pacino have to meet in a movie that is so bad.ever since "scent of woman," writers and directors have used pacino to romanticize their pathetic lines. his characters are nothing more than loudspeakers - their voices covering up what would normally be redundant and trite. he needs to reinvent himself, showing how he can act without yelling. he has to stop feeling sorry for hokey scripts with cheesy lessons like "organized football is messed up," and act out a good story.

i have never seen a more unrealistic movie than this foul piece of dung. the acting was over the top. the direction was tacky and amateurish. the script was just a joke. the story looked penned by a person that has never been around a high school football game, much less a professional game. and why, why did oliver stone feel the need to place himself in this movie as an actor? he was terrible, playing the most unrealistic announcer ever. he could not even get hired to do professional wrestling contests. then you have jamie foxx, who throws like a girl. but, he is a tad more athletic than the aged dennis quaid. seriously, stone wanted to direct this film at 16 year old males with add. that is why we hear the loud music, the quick cuts and numerous edits. it just became a bad mtv video. shame on al pacino for doing this crap. cameron diaz? heck, that no-talent takes any role that comes down the pike. when lawrence taylor is the best "actor" you got going, well, your movie sucks! and this one does.

i just got back from "ags". after seeing it, i'm convinced that no matter how much it's written how he extensively researched the film, stone never has watched an nfl game in his life. great cinematography ? give me a break. the game montages were almost unviewable and 90% of the other shots in the film were close-ups. was there anything in this movie that wasn't brought up in "north dallas forty" ?aging star player ... check. young hot shot .... check. painkillers .... check. owner who doesn't "get it" .... check. crazy off-field behavior .... checkalso, it's the playoffs in dallas (i.e dec or jan) in an outdoor stadium, yet people sitting there in tank-tops and shorts ! and what was with those lights ? were they playing in a japanese kabuki theater or a sports stadium ?and the strategy shown in the game was laughable. it's fourth & 1 inside the "sharks'" 30. dallas leads 35-31. kick the frigging field goal. not only would this had made sense football-wise, but you'd then have an even better final sequence where they could have scored and had to go for the two-point conversion. hell, tie the game w/ the extra point and stone could have made it an even 3 hours with overtime.were the lame montages of "old time" football players supposed to be a tribute to the game ? give me a break.and the script ... ugh. more cliches than you can shake a stick at .. oops, there's another one."slapshot" was better than this movie. by far.1/10.skips this at all costs.

beautiful images, propaganda and history as toy. the ingredients of this film, good, interesting but with many shadows. politicall shadows. jefferson is more than the hero of a mythical america. he is silhouette of a vision about life and society, an extraordinary thinker, teacher of large part of north america. in film is only superman. the delicate contour of ideas are crushed. the subtle birth of essential truth is forgotten. and jefferson is basic instrument for create a good image of american realities. the end,triumphal and fake, romance and heroic, is gun suicide of a story who may be tall with more wisdom. and the war against "avatar" is another gray stain. for one who heard nothing about jefferson, movie is a good beginning. for the others - disillusion. it is like the precious silk of a tailor. but the tailor is fascinating about silk and the clothes are only ordinary cloth. so, a sad experience. slices of beauty and boring lakes, patriotic lesson and the crush of expectation. a film who must impressive. and the ash of a story who could be magnificent.

when i first watched this film, i thought that it would be rally good, because it featured my favourite actor of all time. he gives a sterling performance, though it is fairly obvious he didn't have to life more than half a finger to make the róle work. he is the only good thing in it, unlesss you're into explosions and american dream-working class hero trash (which i'm not). i don't get it. how can this film get away with being so naf. that bit with the little boy being rescued, i mean, come on! you can't tell me that he would have been rescued without the fire-guy wearing any goggles (i know for a fact that it would have been pitch black in there and you can't see for more than a couple of feet infront of you) and no breathing equipment (he'd have choked after 2 minutes!). this film was just bad, ok?why robert? whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy????!!!!sorry if this is your favourite film.

the man who gave us splash, cocoon and parenthood gave us this incoherent muddle of cliched characters, poor plotting, you've-got-to-be-kidding dialogue and melodramatic acting? i guess everybody has a bad day at the office now and then. he's allowed.

the basic plot is good and can be engaging. the music is so great that it became the theme music for the tv show iron chef (though it is way overused and too intrusive in the movie). so, how did this movie end up so poor?!?! well, the plot was about 95% predictable and the characters were about as 1-dimensional as possible. and the dialog?! what person would actually allow themselves to receive credit for coming up with the stupid macho bull-crap that purports to be dialog? you get much greater realism from most cartoons! the bottom line is that this movie has some good points but is so marred by hackneyed clichés and rotten dialog that it quickly becomes tiresome. and, this is a shame, because firemen deserve a better tribute than this mess! if you don't believe me, look at the number of goofs listed on imdb for this movie--way in excess of what you'd expect to find. they just didn't care enough to work out all the kinks and problems. so, as a result the movie seems rushed and in need of a re-write and re-editing.

if you can watch a film without worrying about the plot, or corny acting, then backdraft is definitely the one.however, if, like me, you like watching films that you can believe, then backdraft has some serious flaws. it doesn't offer anything new, and there are hundreds of 90's action films that follow identical formulas, whilst not being quite as clunky.after two firefights, i'm thinking, this has got to go somewhere else, i mean, how many big fires are there in one city? surely firemen do other things, such as getting cats out of trees? well i was wrong, and the repetition continues again and again, up until the end.a good aspect of the film is the fire itself, well filmed, and i must say i felt quite hot while watching it, which suggests that two hours of watching fire without a story or acting would have been more suited to my taste.

i loved this movie when i was a teenager. loved it. it hasn't grown up with me, though. maybe that's because it's a melodramatic load of old rubbish, full of macho posturing, cheesy dialogue, overwrought slo-mo and characters saying 'goddammit' a lot. the lumpy narrative blobs gracelessly from one character to another, one plot strand to another, without ever bringing it all together, and it doesn't help that william baldwin's mono-expression of a performance is wet enough to put out every fire in the movie's overlong runtime. robert deniro and donald sutherland are worth watching, but no one's really at the top of their game here, and the women folk get particularly short thrift. the only real impact comes from the impressive firefighting sequences, and hans zimmer's majestic score, which remains one of my all-time favourites.

the other day i showed my boyfriend a great movie, stand by me, a movie i have shown to many people and they absolutely adored it, but for some odd reason he didn't like it. he lends me a movie called backdraft and he tells me that he's shown it to many people and they loved it, instead i hated this movie. i don't think i've hated a movie so much in a while, how this movie has even a 6.6 rating is beyond me. i couldn't keep up with the five million stories here: billy baldwin becoming a fire man, the random sibling rivalry, the random love story(s), the who's being an arson story, the investigator, the fire who has a personality of it's own. i just have a problem that this movie can't keep up with all these stories, they didn't balance out well enough make the film interesting. i would have just preferred if this movie was about being a firefighter or the investigator and how he came to be one or what it is exactly he does and why.the movie tells the story of a group of chicago firefighters, two brothers. stephen "bull" mccaffrey, the elder brother, is obsessed with the beating of the fires that he fights. brian, the younger brother quit the fire fighting academy school several years before, then embarking on a number of other unsuccessful careers before returning to become a firefighter. he is looked down on by his elder brother who expects him to fail in his newly chosen career as a fire fighter. donald "shadow" rimgale is an arson investigator who is dedicated to his profession. he is called in because a number of fires that have occurred have somewhat similar connections. .martin swayzak is an alderman on the city council. he has obvious hopes of being elected to mayor, but has had to make a number of budget cuts to the fire department. many of the rank and file firemen believe that the cuts that he has made are endangering the lives of the firefighters. however, swayzak is initially successful in portraying the fire department as bloated and ineffectual after firemen are repeatedly being killed in blazes.i just couldn't get into this movie, i don't know how anyone else could, it was incredibly unrealistic and portrayed firefighters all wrong. i loved how they had every action cliché in the book to match this action flick. i just felt also like there was great talent wasted on such mediocre roles, donald sutherland, great actor, but such a strange role that could have been taken by a lesser known man who had the upcoming talent at the time. i know ron was going for great quality, but i think him casting such huge actors in small roles was a mistake for this film. i even had to joke my way through while watching this movie commenting how the doctor in the background was probably kevin spacey. the fire was so unrealistic and the movie was just so out there, i didn't enjoy it and honestly wouldn't recommend it to people, i'll stick to the recommendations in my relationship from this point on.2/10

the unfunniest so called comedy i've ever seennot a patch on the naturalism of the hilariously dare twin townvegas i ;like normally but this script is so dire so predictable so well english in the worst way (in recent years the english films have been awful all of them) ireland at least produced the commitments, scotland with braveheart and trainspotting 2 stand out great movies and wales had twin town, zulu, last days of dolwyn , torchwood, doctor who and under milk wood etcthe comedy is paint by numbers, the actors are dead men walking because there is no characterisation and no originality and it's just so unfunnyengland is falling behind no matter how many grim up north movies they produce. it's the old class system that destroys english films. the oxbridge graduates spewing endlessly clichéd scripts about working class people they've never lived with. it is pathetic. monty python wasn't funny, neither was anything from oxbridge.let guys like jonny vegas and peter kay, rob brydon, billy connolly or write their own dialogue and forget the archaic failed class system let the working class people and the real talent that comes through the system properly take over the writing and the british and english film industries will rise again what next prince edward to write a modern day oliver twist?

now i like johnny vegas which is a good start, i also enjoy toilet humoursuch as young ones and bottom etc. this however failed to bring even asmall smile to my face. the story follows johnny around after his wifechucks him out (how he got his good looking wife and kid i dont know) as he attempts to shag anything that moves. failing normally. i was looking forward to this but found it to be totally boring and a wasteof my time altogether. unless you are stuck for something to do for 90 mins apart from wash the car then dont bother..... 

oh sex lives of the potato men, what foul demon created thee? this is a film that you watch, smirk a little during the runtime and then when you mention it to others having seen it, you just cannot help but smile as you talk. but it's not that sex lives of the potato men is actually a funny film and one that inspires you to smile when talking or thinking about it, it's just that the film is so bizarre; is so insulting and is no shameless in its attempt to get across a meek laugh to do with sex and sex lives in general that you just cannot help but have your mouth break out into a grin. do bear in mind that what follows the smirk is a sinking of the head; a consequent shake of the head and a raise of the index finger and thumb to both eyebrows as you gently rub them in an attempt to reminisce about your time watching this trash.but that's what the film is, it's trash; it's very brave and shameless trash but trash none-the-less. whoever came up with this idea, put it to paper and then spread it around the industry trying to get it made must either be very brave or very desperate. it's strange to have a film that is most definitely 'about' something but one that does not have, under any sort of circumstance, a decisive narrative. this follows on from that idea that most of european cinema is artistic and its stories are ambiguous and open-ended and themes take precedence over most other things. in sex lives of the potato men, the same situation and technically the same joke are replayed over and over again and that is an ideation that consists of: 'sex is a very, very funny thing.' these ideas are perhaps more suited to an american film so it's no wonder that after a while watching this film, things start to feel a little out of sorts.the film begins and ends in the same manner, creating a feeling of a circular journey; a circular journey that has gone absolutely nowhere and absolutely nothing has been achieved. three blokes sit around a table talking and what-not. their boss joins them and the conversation is limited to whatever crude and disgusting stories, situations or scenarios each can possibly think of. the odd thing here, being that whenever one man says something nasty, the other grimaces but has an equally filthy story to give in return creating a contradiction in what these men find to cross the line and what they do not. the men are dave (vegas) and ferris (crook), two people joined by tolly (coleman) whenever the film sees fit to throw in a third face to crack some more nasty sex jokes or break some peculiar stories. they are employed by jeremy (gattis), a man who has deeper issues and problems but issues of which the film is more concerned with exploiting for the sake of humour rather than study.so what's the situation in sex lives of the potato men? the three to four men are in a crisis and for the duration of the film, we will adopt the role of the hapless fly on the wall as we witness what foul play these people get up to over the period of about a week. if the humour revolving around dave and ferris is disgusting and repulsive, then for jeremy things are just spooky. it all begins rather innocently and it appears there is a female he likes and one who equally likes him in return but when the essence that jeremy is merely a stalker creeps in, that's when the jaws drop. the character of jeremy is used and put across in a way that makes unrequited love and stalking in general merely look 'funny'. jeremy sits in his apartment listening to classical music and writing out letters of abuse to ruth (davis), echoing some sort of psychotic persona more associated with hannibal lecter writing his letter's to clarice in 2001's hannibal. but whatever sympathy we might have for him at this point is rendered absolutely false when, later on, it is revealed the true origin of their relationship. suddenly, we as an audience feel cheated into feeling a mite sorry for him earlier on and for whatever reason he did do what he did in the first place just seems cowardly and distasteful. to say what it was would ruin whatever few surprises lurk within the film.quite sad how, in one of jeremy's letters, he writes about something-or-other exclaiming it to have "no artistic vision  just one big mess". i hate it when words said by the characters echo the film they're in. sex lives of the potato men does not explore someone's psyche or particular interest in a fetish or why they feel the need to go around having as much sex as possible, it just uses them as a front to pile on ridiculously unfunny jokes and situations. rather than take group sex and explore what drives a person to seek it down, it makes a daft joke out of it (tickets with numbers on!?); rather than get into the mindset of a fan of sadomasochism, the film has someone hang from a basement ceiling and warn everyone of 'incoming salt and vinegar' as he climaxes. ferris covers his face in disgust and the camera fades to the next scene without too much of a fuss. it's a relief the film got to no audiences abroad. this is one section of british culture, indeed of the british mentality that i pray will be confined to our shores and ignored accordingly.

george sluizer's original version of the vanishing aka the man who wanted to know offers one of european cinema's most quietly disturbing sociopaths and one of the most memorable finales of all time (shamelessly stolen by tarantino for kill bill volume two), but it has plenty more to offer than that. playing around with chronology and inverting the usual clichés of standard 'lady vanishes' plots, it also offers superb characterisation and strong, underplayed but convincing performances.unfortunately, i can only assume that when it came to the remake, sluizer was so determined that no-one else was going to get the chance to ruin his film when he was perfectly capable of doing it himself, but few people could have anticipated how comprehensively he trashes his own work. his career never recovered from this disastrous misstep.chief culprit is an astonishing performance by jeff bridges that has been over thought through in every detail to a truly disastrous level. a friend who produced one of his earliest movies noted that bridges was a great instinctive actor as long as you stopped him thinking about what he was doing, and this film is the proof of the pudding. every movement is overly mechanical in its precision, making him look like a rusty clockwork toy, while his voice is a bizarre mixture of tootsie, latka gravas from taxi and a dalek who have all been taking elocution lessons from dok-tah e-ville. no banality of evil here, just a looney walking around with an invisible sign over his head saying "please. let. me. kill. you. thank you. for your. consideration.' but the blame really needs to be shared out here. none of the performances are good: often, they don't even look good  keifer sutherland looks more like a baby hamster than a distraught man at his wits end in the hurried scenes at the gas station, nancy travis flounders badly and sandra bullock makes no impression at all as the object of his obsession. not that they're given any help by either director or writer todd graff. the script is particularly weak. the chronology has been altered to put the focus firmly on bridges at the expense of the couple at the opening of the film. worse is the rush the film is in, draining the life and character from each scene in its race to get to the next. rather than the high/low mood shifts in the couple's relationship or the apparently casual but careful establishing of the feel of the location, we just get a couple of arguments that give you the impression that he's probably better off without her. as for the new and improved happy ending  standard woman chased by nutter in the woods jeopardy stuff complete with lame 'let's end on a joke like a tv cop show' moment  best not go there which is advice that holds for this entire trainwreck of a movie. even a shockingly bland and uninspired jerry goldsmith score can't do anything for this one.

skip this hollywood version, a real piece of garbage. a cheap insult to the brilliant original "spoorloos", or by the english title also called "the vanishing". it completely misses the mark in typical, grotesque hollywood fashion, usually due to a bunch of talentless, corporate bean counters who haven't the vaguest idea about anything artistic, they just look for the "successful formula" and want it applied to everything to glean a profit. much like the awful "the scarlet letter" made in 1995, which twisted the original story around so much to suit the macdonaldsland crowd, that it became an aberration, not even a bastardization, but a pile of goop that has been sort of shaped similar but does not look, feel or even remotely resemble the spirit of the original. except that movie at least had gary oldman, who is interesting to watch in anything he does. this dog has nothing going for it, even the usually very talented jeff bridges is an embarrassment. great tragedy is not nor never should be "the feel good movie of the year" but rather takes one or more of the sadly much too frequent tragic events in life and allows the reader/viewer to draw meaning and insight into the human condition.do yourself a great favor if you're looking for a rental and skip this grotesque garbage and pick up the original made in a dutch/french collaboration in 1988. that is a great film. this is a horrific mess.

when george sluizer was told he could direct an american version of the book "het gouden ei"/the movie "spoorloos"(outside holland, this movie has the name "the vanishing" too), he was told that this would only go through if the ending was changed - he was told that 'the american audience' wouldn't approve the original ending. of course, the original ending is much better, and without it, the movie loses its impact. because i have already put this in the trivia section, i won't give the original ending and keep my comment spoiler-free. if you want to know the original ending, watch "spoorloos" or read the book. this movie is absolute rubbish, and the first kiefer sutherland movie i don't like. watch the original dutch movie, which is one of the best thrillers in the world.

the film starts out with a narration of the protagonist explaining certain crimes occurring all over the city and then we get to know that the hero is a cop who is either suspended or has probably retired. i did not have the patience or the interest to verify the above before commenting. if there is a stereotype for narrators to have a deep, sleep-inducing voice then, it is high time to put an end to it. i seriously fell asleep and did not bother to shut the movie down either. am still trying to figure out what the movie was all about and why there were no outdoor shootings. a third rate tv serial will have more number of sets compared to this crap of a movie and i still pity the actors and producers involved in this huge bullshit of a movie. it ought to have been produced as a normal tv serial or maybe even as a local theater drama instead of putting it out on the big screen. total waste of time and money. the movie was supposed to be in production for a long time and it would have been better to have left it that way.with redundant sleep inducing dialogs and sets, this is the worst movie i have come across.

once upon a time theresa russell made a few halfway decent movies, so i keep hoping that one of her efforts from the past decade or two will merit a rating of at least 6 or 7 (out of 10). however, dark world is just the latest in a string of disappointments. the first 90 minutes are very hard to watch. the lines are delivered by the lead actors as if they are being read at a first rehearsal or even a casting session (in which the actors are doing it for the sake of their agents, but do not really want the parts for which they are perfunctorily reading). the sets and props seem "off" somehow (what kind of a police department would allow a detective to have a whole living room wall shelved full of case file holders?). the screen is constantly cluttered with meaningless time and datelines, which appear with no rhyme or reason. now, if the scriptwriter were standing here after the lights go up from a film fest screening, they no doubt would crow about how all these shortcomings are really clever clues to the plot turning topsy-turvy in this misfire's final five minutes. well, for those audience members whose only other movie experiences are tv: the movie and surfer, dude; they might be bamboozled into nodding their heads in agreement. but it is hard to believe that anyone who has seen 10 or more movies in their life--and is not a close friend or relative of a dark world cast or crew member--could fall for such a lame canard. despite what the d.v.d. box might lead you to believe, this movie has about as much resemblance to sunset boulevard (dead narrator device) or hitchcock (schizophrenic protagonist device) as a drained jim beam bottle refilled with urine has to booze!

watched this months ago on netflix instant and left a review there.let me say, most of the other reviews are very accurate. this movie was bad writing, bad acting and bad directing. i too, had liked russell and pare "back in the old days" and was very hopeful for them. in my netflix review, i mentioned that i lost interest in the film and proceeded to wash the dishes and make a sandwich, yet still watching the movie from the kitchen. when i did return to the living room, i was very confused as the last 5 minutes of the film unfolded. i even rewound it to make sure i was not missing anything. this film totally crapped out on how to do a "twist" ending. i suspect that the idea sounded good, maybe the script was intriguing, but the budget was so non-existent that sets were really lacking. and yes, i suppose all those "bad sets" were an effort to give the viewer a clue. all it told me was "low budget."anyway, the reason i came here, was because over the weekend i saw a review of shutter island, and with what the reviewers were saying, or not saying, lead me to believe that shutter island is the same deal, only with a budget 50 to 60 times more! (actually i have no idea how much dark world cost, but i hope they didn't spend more than 1 million!)so, that being said, i kinda thought that if someone reworked the script a bit, got a bigger budget for a better "look" (whether that meant a better scenic designer, or better post coloring, just someone with a vision,) they could remake dark world into a passable product. now it sounds like shutter island is doing that. looks like they got the vision right, but the scripting could still be off. money can't buy everything, but it should in hollywood!ps my 2 star rating is for russell and pare.

this film is absolute trash and proceeds to become even worse towards the, very protracted, end! the plot is confused and laboured, the actors have a couldn't care less attitude (maybe they were paid in advance - bad move, or knew they weren't going to get paid), and the sets were featureless, boring and cheap.i fell asleep twice and actually decided to not bother with the last 5 minutes as i assumed the actors would have fallen asleep themselves by then. more unrecoverable life time wasted!if you must watch it, then take it to the bedroom and forget the sleeping pills for once. but maybe you'll need an antidepressant instead!sometimes it's good if celluloid degrades.

i was hoping this would be a good weekly vehicle for tim curry, one of my all-time favorite performers. alas and alack, it is not. there doesn't seem to be any chemistry between anyone on the show, the dialogue is decidedly uninspired, and even the laugh track appeared to be laboring. brutal.

i rented this movie, because i noticed the cover in the video rental store. i saw nolte, connely, madsen, 40's time setting, and thought "hmm, can't be too bad." unfortunately, after watching it, my impression was "not too good".its kind of a chinatown ripoff, but the worst part is that other than nolte, the other members of the squad didn't get enough screen time. but its a decent movie to see once i guess. and melanie's role was small enough that she wasn't given a chance to be a nuisance.

william petersen (that c.s.i guy) has a small uncredited role but it's the best part of the movie. his character comes across smart ass and tough, and it's a fun surprise to see him in this. he has a range that allows him to play just about anything. after his 5 minutes, it goes from looking cool to just nothing much. it leaves you hoping that his character will reappear in the movie but after 20 minutes you give up hope. the movie itself is pretty poor. worth a watch on tmn or a pick up at the library but not much more. too much of it reminds you of l.a confidential except that where that movie starts to get complicated upon itself, this one is so loose, it steers everywhere but where it should. 2 out of 5 stars

i went to see this film at the cinema on the strength of its potentially interesting subject matter, good cast, a director who had previously done the highly-rated "once were warriors" and my liking for noir-ish films set in l.a. in the forties and fifties. i would argue that i am reasonably easy to please in this film category; i appreciate the classics of the genre but i will sit through and enjoy a half-decent if derivative effort as well. however, i found this film completely unbearable.despite a good situation in which to place the story, nobody seems to do or say anything remotely interesting or entertaining in the whole two-hours plus of this sorry mess. good actors are wasted in endless scenes of dialogue ranging from banal to embarrassing. the narrative is slack and drags unbearably, and none of the events it depicts is handled well enough to do anything other than bore the audience to death. there is no drama, no atmosphere, no tension, absolutely no entertainment value and by the end i simply didn't care what happened because i did not believe in anything in the film.l.a. confidential came out a year later and regardless of whether one version of the story is more true-to-life, the latter film deservedly gets all the plaudits for its excellence in every department. mulholland falls by contrast fails in every department, a fact made all the more tragic by the amount of talent involved. if they ever show this on a plane i will still walk out.

i saw this movie on the shelf at blockbuster and thought it looked cool. the dvd case touted so many great actors and i wondered to myself, "why have i never heard of this movie?" then i turned over the case and saw the director, lee tamahori, and thus the answer began to explain itself. first of all i want to defeat the idea that a great cast equals a great movie, but more importantly, i think i should explain why this movie is so terrible. okay, the script is awful and full of one dimensional characters. this is the worst role i've ever seen chazz palminteri play and i'm surprised he would do something this ridiculous. however, under-appreciated yet talented actors must earn their money. palminteri plays a one dimensional police detective who comes off about as dumb as a c-movie mob henchman. him, along with the lead detective (the poorly directed nolte), the great but simple michael madsen, and the late chris penn (whose role along with madsen's was completely thrown away) make up an elite squad of la detectives tasked to rid the city of mobsters sometime in the late 30s or 40s. the movie introduces this squad as cops who will break every law to make sure those who think they're above the law don't operate in their city. at the beginning of the film the cops rough up a local restaurant, grab an alleged mobster (william peterson) and take him to a place they call the mulholland falls. they toss him off one of the cliffs on mullholland drive and this is supposed to demonstrate how serious these guys are about ridding the city of crime. whatever. this was nothing more than a cheap excuse to use a crappy title that's designed to make you think of la and its famous sites. somewhere later on they find the dead body of jennifer connelly and the plot begins. on to the direction which was nothing short of amateur and weak! aside from the fact that the characters were b-movie quality, the overacting by those such as treat williams, the guy who plays the chief of police, and the awful daniel baldwin are just a few highlights that made this movie seem like it was lee tamhori's first film. there's not one good performance in the movie aside from maybe melanie griffith, who some might argue was the worst in the movie (she won a razzie for this film). in the end, it was her character that was not that great and she really didn't have much to work with. as with any bad movie, it all begins with the writing, and this script was no gem. plot is formulated simply on the basis of setting up the next scene and never takes into consideration characters' motivations. the way the characters behaved was unbelievable. cops taking the law into their own hands is believable within the right circumstances (see la confidential) but in this case it looked like these guys could get away with anything, including murder, and never bat an eye about cleaning anything up. i guess we as an audience are just supposed to assume that no one saw anything and that people won't ask questions. everything about the story is predictable and is spoon fed so well that we understand everything that's going to happen a good while before the characters do. however, it doesn't make us feel smart, but rather makes us angry at how stupid the hero is, despite the fact that there aren't any heroes in this movie. in the end, the best component of the movie was the great score by david grusin. from the beginning, it invoked a since of chinatown, which quickly faded when i realized how unbelievable just about everything in the film was. it didn't surprise me to learn that it made a whopping eleven million in the box office. what i will say is that this film is worth watching for a few laughs. nick nolte's acting is like an unsuccessfully domesticated junkyard dog and i laughed every time he tried to be serious. i also nearly fell on the floor at each of the slow motion shots used in the film (i think there are three with one during a key fight scene). when you have to use slow motion in the heat of a dramatic moment, you clearly have some problems. so, even with my negative criticism, i will recommend this movie solely for the purpose of enticing laughter, that is, if you appreciate the good movies like la confidential.

the four la cops in fedoras driving around in a big black convertible look faintly absurd, and even more ridiculous when it turns out that nick nolte, the dumbest-looking of the lot, is in charge. the writer never manages to create a spirit of camaraderie among the squad members, and the director fails to wring articulacy out of the man-mountain nolte. foprget questioning anyone. nolte's character lights a cigaret, gets mad, and beats interviewees to a pulp. his methods get him nowhere, until at one point in the action he is wandering from tossed residence to tossed residence with his mouth open and his brain shut. he smashes up an fbi squad, and throws two military officers out of a plane in flight, with only a vague report of anger at hq and no punishment at all. at the end of the film he is as gormless and muscle-bound as he was at the outset. how he managed to get a beautiful whore to fall deeply in love with him is a mystery, as is the eternal devotion and tragic sense of betrayal expressed by his jobless wife. two interesting shots in the picture: one, of an atomic explosion, the other of a gigantic crater, ostensibly caused by a bomb. it's almost as wrecked and puffy as nolte's face.

a special unit of four police detectives are dispensing justice in their own unique way in 1950s los angeles. nick nolte plays max hoover, the unit's lead officer and his partners are played by michael madsen, chazz palminteri and chris penn. also starring are melanie griffith, jennifer connelly and john malkovich among others. quite an impressive list of names. unfortunately that is the only thing even remotely impressive about this film.our story begins when young allison pond, played by connelly, turns up dead in a remote area of town currently under development. our band of four detectives is called in and it is immediately obvious that nolte's max hoover is going to be taking a very personal interest in this case. we will soon find out that allison, in addition to knowing hoover quite well, was also involved with some rather important military and government types who may have had reason to want her dead. but who exactly was involved and why exactly would they want this seemingly harmless woman dead? hoover and crew set out to find out. sounds like an interesting premise but unfortunately it goes nowhere.despite the impressive array of names, the acting here leaves much to be desired. nolte is overacting, madsen seems incredibly bored, palminteri and malkovich come off as caricatures, penn has hardly anything to do and griffith is dull as can be. by far the best performance is connelly's in all too fleeting flashback sequences. the dialogue throughout the film is forced and wooden. the sense of drama you would expect from a mystery of this type is missing altogether. nothing dramatic really happens. in fact nothing at all seems to happen for the bulk of the picture. instead we just slog along towards a rather ludicrous and incredibly disappointing climax. when the "mystery" is solved you may find yourself saying, "oh come on now, is that all there is?" but it gets worse as after the mystery is solved we get a completely ridiculous and utterly unbelievable action sequence. and even then we are made to suffer further as another awful, badly acted, completely unnecessary scene is tacked on at the end. and then mercifully it is over. and not a moment too soon.

if this is film noir, then noir must be french for glacially slow. take a cast of completely unlikeable characters, give them nothing to say, punctuate the whole thing with gratuitous ultra-violence, and you've got the formula for an aggravated dash. could be subtitled "sleazy hollywood types attempt to make money from chinatown rip-off". bruce dern's one minute part is orders of magnitude better than anything else in this flick. by the way, i didn't like the film.

this movie is very modern and forward. it is about 75% in english. it is aimed at english-speaking multiplex-going young audience. basic plot is similar to ddlj. acting is below average.unfortunately they are portraying a wrong picture and setting a bad example for the youngsters. tanisha is shown drinking from a bottle, or taking shots of tequila about 5-6 times in the movie. the director does not even acknowledge she is an alcoholic and has a drinking problem. all through the movie she only wears bikini tops whether she is at work, at a beach or at a wedding. the heroine of the movie doing this makes the youngsters feel this behaviour is acceptable.the less that is said about failure of uday chopra doing shahrukh khan's ddlj role of arrogant girl-chaser, the better. the movie is about equality of sexes. but equality should not be about making the same mistakes, instead about doing the right to do the right thing. if men have been shown as chronic casanovas in movies, does not mean women should also portray same behaviour.even though the movie is made in light-hearted fun spirit, it promotes so many wrong social notions in the name of being forward, that "fun" part of the movie makes no impact. not even in canada women dress like this, or guys behave like they have shown in the movie. it is certainly not a reflection of indian society or even canadian society. perhaps they should have a disclaimer at the beginning stating, "all characters and events in the movie are imaginary and do not reflect the actual culture of the cities and countries mentioned in the film." the only good thing about this movie is the length, 1.5 hrs, thank god.

this movie is not worth anything. i mean, if you want to watch this kind of stuff, flip to hollywood movies! this totally is a disgrace to the bollywood name. neal n nikki seriously sucked! never watch this movie. as for the actors, it appears the acting genes skipped a generation. tanisha couldn't have worn less and uday chopra obviously was just picked because he was the director's spoiled son. (all of that halla re was amazingly stupid) the songs are eh, and i hope the director did not spend to much money on it...... bottom line, i hated the movie. do not let your kids watch it, and if you have it in your house it is a stupid movie so discard it! buy the cd, if you must. (as i said, the songs are eh.) at least it is better then the movie.

oh my god, why, did i waste my precious time on this film? it is pathetic, waaaay ott and unrealistic, and one of the worst films i have ever seen in my life. yes, my life. i am embarrassed for yash raj films, the poor guys have to live with the horrible news that yes, they produced this terrible film.this is by far, the most, trashy, sexual, eyebrow-raising movie i have ever seen by yash raj films. i cringe for them, i really do. along with the terrible acting (or no acting, for that matter) by uday chopra, combined with the lack of talent of the "look at my boobs" tanisha, neal 'n' nikki has not one good thing about it at all. even the music is not upto the standard left by yrf. the director, arjun sablok, did an embarrassingly bad job here.honestly, i expected more. much, much more.

i did have some expectations from this film because 1. it was a yash raj production 2. when the songs were first shown on tv, they seemed catchy 3. the star(??!) cast was new. well, i must tell u that i just couldn't sit through this movie. uday, (with his red lips-what were the make up artists thinking???!) tries hard to look cool but fails miserably. i won't even get started on his acting (if u can call it that). 'cleavage queen' tanisha with all her screaming and ranting n raving just makes you want to pull your hair out in frustration. i think uday was slightly more tolerable than her! she seriously needs to take acting lessons from her sister. the story is pathetic...the same old tried and tested formula. absolutely no originality. there is nothing worth watching in this movie. makes me wonder why it was made in the first place!

i agree that this movie is about sex without any seduction or love. in fact, it makes sex seem so boring and makes me wonder why bother. i actually don't think at all this remotely speaks of how canadian indian second generations feel about sex. at any rate, did you know the first hotel/drunk idea was copied from a korean movie, yopgijogin gunyo, made in 2001 or thereabouts? that korean film was actually brilliant as comedy but at the same time compels the audience to reflect on the complexity of man-woman relationships and man-woman difference in experience and thinking. i mean most of the neal n nikki hotel/drunk segment was emulated take by take. can't bollywood movie makers try to make originals only, please? seriously, i never enjoyed a hindi flick that is a copycat. the ones i enjoy have always spoken indian feelings through indian cultural means.

i'd give this film a 1/10. this film is devoid of common cinematic substance and concentrates way too much upon the current "skin trend" in bollywood movies. i'd definitely not recommend teenagers to watch this movie. what really makes me feel dejected is how could such an impressive banner like yash chopra films ever succumb to such an awful production? they have perhaps forgotten to keep in view that there is a larger audience than "adult" audience too, which when exposed to these sort of gross movies,may wreck their growing mind set and succumb to things devoid of sense and recognition.on the whole, films must not only be entertaining, but also must comprise of some sense as well. certainly, this film is an immense disappointment to yash chopra fans, especially me myself. i am really disappointed over the plot, acting and everything else. why can't people put in some substance that can be cherished after confronted with in the films, at least for once throughout the film? the point is clear. i'd like to put my opinion in short: "horrible - disappointment - lot of adult material - lack of sensible "substance" - lack of normal psyche - worthless - could grab a cornetto or a temptations chocolate instead"

neal n nikki is voted on of the worst films of the year by planetbollywood. its hard to believe the famous chopra's have produced this lousy movie. it was presented as a movie for the family, but turns out to be a ridiculous sex comedy. nor does it make you laugh, but cry of boredom and nor does it have any sexy girls to make the film look sexy. the title song is the most annoying song of the decade, i'm the neil, i'm the man, rock star superstar. uday chopra is one of bollywood's worst actors ever with no acting talent. after making many super flops, and not receiving any movies from a producer rather then his family. he gives a total crap performance, that bores you to death. tanisha, who is and will always be known for being kajol's sister, gives a dreadful performance. both actors have the most annoying chemistry, and are very immature for their age. it has a special appearance by the very cute richa pollad, in a pathetic role. the ending was so daft and stupid, i cant believe i actually paid money to rent this crap.

yash raj films are so funny, whatever works they follow it yet they are called the best production house?seeing bhatt films working they copied the formula, bikini and everything plus casting low actors like uday and tanishaathe film is so horrible it makes you cringethe jokes are so bad and horny it makes you slap them uday resembles a gay plus a monkeytanishaa resembles an idiot the director thinks we all are idiots arjun sablok takes the audience for granted music is saving grace camera-work is gooduday chopra hams like an idiot, tanishaa looks like kajol in k3g if kajol was annoying der then tanishaa is worse the rest are okay

it is definitely not worth spending either money or time. it is the same hackneyed plot of a guy and a girl meeting and falling in love. but this is with a western touch. but it fails miserably in either depicting a love story or giving it the western touch. never do we feel that the hero and heroin are in love. there is no depth to either of their characters. probably, with a better cast, some justice could have been brought about to the characters. finally, it is a movie with no fun, no acting, no theme, no plot, no comedy , no action, no thrill, no romance (i associate romance to something more passionate). definitely not a movie you would want to go with your family. overall, if you are looking for a movie with some content, this is definitely not an option. i shall wait for the day when bollywood movies are something that i can wait to watch and i can refer to my friends as a "must watch" movie.

i had high hopes for this movie i even gave up a night of watching stargate for this movie. i found it had a rushed feel about it and a lot of the key biblical moments and facts were missing. i might be a bit jaded and spoiled for the 1956 version, as i have watched that one every year for the last 20 or so years. i doubt this one will make it to the realm of yearly classic, as the other one has. if you have not seen the 19546 version, you might like this one but, i seriously doubt it and urge you to skip this one and go rent or buy the classic one. this has some nifty special effects but that is not what i look for when telling a movie like the ten commandments. i was kind of looking to see how they told the story, and the writers did not do a good job with this one.

i watched this series out of curiosity,wanting to see if they could possibly and with all this modern technology,out do cecil b. demille's classic epic of 1956, starring charleton heston,yul brenner and sir cedric hardwicke. of course, i was let down. yes, they had all the biblical characters correct, but they didn't give us any of the spectacular theatrical scenes, that held your interest throughout the first movie. if you going to have a mini-series, you have to have some "rivoting" scenes, the "burning bush", parting the "red sea",drowning "pharohs armies", "building sethi's pyramids", could have been done with todays' technology on the scale of blockbuster movies such as "lord of the rings" or the matrix. obviously, they didn't want to leave a lasting impression of "faith and sacrifice", which is much needed in these trouble times.

the only reason i am giving a second star is for the first half of the movie. this was a good rendition of the story. i enjoy seeing a few fictional characters added to add some color to a well known story. but the second half was horrible!!! yes there were violent aspects of this story. but the writers of this movie chose to only include the violence and forget about the good things god did for the israelites. towards the end of the movie scott looked as though he were getting messages from the big giant head instead of talking and hearing from god. this rendition had some huge problems with deviation from scripture. and big surprise, there are no favorable deviations! their portrayal of moses as this screaming naked lunatic who did all of this against his will is totally false. it showed a moses who had to scream in order to get god to talk to him. wrong the scripture says god spoke to moses all the time and not just after a temper tantrum. they got the people's complaining right, but failed to show that god spoke to moses at sinai in an audible voice that the followers could hear and believe.(chapter 19). they also forgot the pillar of fire and cloud which guided them in the day and night.what was the whole joshua thing? the righteous peace loving jew who would not fight until moses threatens him? wrong (he was known as a great warrior) what about the great speech that moses gave the army telling them god had helped them enough and now they were on their own?? wrong (they only won through god's help as shown in their own scenes with moses lifting his staff)and what was that sorry looking ark of the covenant? instead of overlaying it with gold this movie was on a tight budget and attached little gold chips to it! oh yeah, it was a "molten calf" not a straw one with little chips tacked on. someone forgot that they came out of egypt with a huge amount of gold tribute from the egyptians. you wouldn't know it from this sorry looking bunch.by the way, the part about them slaying the israelites after the golden calf incident says "men" and does not mention women and children which the movie delighted in showing the viewers. oh yeah - manna wasn't the only thing sent from heaven - don't forget the birds for meat. also, the bible mentions jethro bringing moses his wife and children and then says jethro went back to his own land. it does not say that moses gave up his family.oh well, if you know nothing about the real story, read exodus for yourself. if you know the real story, you will hate this version.

i nearly fell asleep during a screening of this. of a boring story that seems to go on forever, it follows several days in the life of a male prostitute who falls in love with one of his tricks. after a heated affair, the trick leaves a long letter explaining why they cannot be together and how they must go on their separate ways.the male prostitute then goes on a downward self-destructive spiral trying to find his "one true love", repeatedly returning to the same places they frequented, looking for more clues or signs as to where he may locate his love.in the meanwhile, he hooks up with one ugly guy (who i thought was also a male prostitute), a gay basher, and some guy who ends up having a "three-second sexual intercourse session" with him in a back alley.it never ceases to amaze me how films still portray random sex acts as scenes that can take place in a brief matter of seconds, such as in this case where the trick barely has his pants unbuckled before thrusting three times and miraculously experiencing orgasm! all of these random encounters end with the sexual partner asking him to call them, to which he discards their telephone numbers.there is a brief side-plot involving the main character visiting his busy mother who seems to have no time for his lifestyle. there is also another brief side-plot involving some random conversation with a young woman who has noticed him several times standing on the bridge from her window. and there is also one more brief side-plot involving him showing the letter to a male acquaintance, but the audience is not advised of his relation to this person.none of these things really connect with each other, only to show us how lost and confused this young man really is. he seems to be living life like a ghost. there was one good scene in the entire movie that involved him rummaging through a yard sale looking for a particular record with the world's saddest song on it.otherwise, this movie just seems to go on forever. filmed in black and white, it may seem very dreamlike, but sitting in the theater for nearly two hours watching this drivel will resemble something more like a nightmare!i found the ending to be confusing as i wasn't quite sure whether the young man had died and gone to heaven? that would have been a nice pay off to end the misery that both audience and the main character had to endure in this meaningless tripe. but seeing as this is an "independent film", movies with endings like these are supposed to encourage you to "use your imagination". for those of you who are seeking out nudity, there are only brief scenes and most of them are filmed in such a way that anything suggestive are artfully concealed within the shadows. in other words, don't waste your time with this one.my rating - 2 out of 10

boy oh boy, does this movie stink. this movie is one of the worst pieces of trash i have ever seen in my whole entire life. please, even if your life depends on it, do not, and i repeat: do not under any circumstances, view this horrid piece of garbage. only watch this thing when it comes on as a mst 3000 episode. that was the only way i could sit through the whole thing. if i had to watch it without that show, i would've stopped watching it before it was over. it does have one use: a cure for insomniacs!!!!!

this joins the endless line of corny, predictable 50's sci-fi shlock out there. as usual, it's pretty bad. there isn't much of a plot that i could detect and the over-exaggeration of the leads only adds to the unintentional laughs. the title is misleading also. catching this on mst3k is probably the only way for it to be viewed, and it's better left that way.

i suppose you could say this film has a grain of potential, but nothing more, because boy did the filmmakers botch it. the plot is practically incomprehensible, the pacing is lethargic and the acting is pathetic. and what the hell is a trade rat? worst of all, though, this movie's climax is the anticlimax of all anticlimaxes; plus the title doesn't seem even remotely accurate. the only redeeming feature of this film is the pretty dark-haired woman... well, the blond girl was pretty too, but she was annoying and not as good looking as the brunette. anyhoo, as with a lot of movies, this is one to be seen only on mst3k.

as a kid, this movie scared me green. as an adult, i couldn't stop laughing.i have not had the pleasure of watching this movie via mst3k. i caught it, instead, on a late saturday afternoon, when there was absolutely nothing in the theaters, and there was nothing left to do outside but rake some autumn leaves. i figured, this had to be better. i was wrong.the movie has some very good elements; a water-divining mystic, a beatnik painter, couple of idiot ranch hands, an elderly history buff, and an "evil wind." um...i mean...evil head. an evil head which will, as soon as the systematic hypnotism of each and every one present is complete, be looking for its evil body.the whole story takes place on an evil "ranch" which apparently neither grows crops, nor raises evil livestock.as everything is declared by their resident mystic to be "evil," you either roll your eyes horribly, or laugh til your sides split, depending on your mood. me? i laughed until i had tears streaming down my face.i remembered this movie fondly as one of those which really scared me as a kid. but some kids are afraid of santa claus, too..no? anyway... if you're into 50's horror camp, then this is definitely a movie you shouldn't miss. if you're looking for a good story line, this movie has that. it's the over the top dramatics and downright innocence of the time that makes it so horrid. the acting was just bad, but it still had some good elements. perhaps it rates a remake...? it rates a 4.3/10 from...the fiend :.

jessica is a young, virginal and very innocent girl who lives with her aunt on a remote ranch. jessica is also a powerful psychic, capable of dowsing, retro-cognition, precognition and esp. when young and handsome gordon hawthorne comes to visit, he is instantly skeptical of jessica's powers...until her skills uncover a lost wristwatch and unearth an ancient treasure chest. however, the treasure chest holds the severed head of a centuries dead satanist named gideon drew, whose powers are far stronger than jessica's. despite her warnings of the evil in their midst, drew manages to mentally enslave everyone unfortunate to make eye contact with him. but drew wants jessica most of all. he needs her dowsing skills to unearth his body, so that he can rise from the dead and rule over the human race. will jessica's powerful fleur de lis, combined with gordon's love, ward the ancient evil off before it can destroy them all?this isn't a very interesting movie. it certainly could have been - the basic story is interesting and imaginative, but the acting is leaden and the whole thing moves much too slowly to hold interest. jessica is also too innocent - almost annoyingly so, and gordon, her love interest, is wooden, stiff and totally emotionless. none of the characters are very likable, and the low budget is painfully obvious. a rushed ending also doesn't help matters. avoid, unless it's the mst3k version.

if you ever visited shenandoah acres as a child and wondered, could there be a worse vacation spot in the world? well, you could have watched this movie and had your answer. flavia (a.k.a. fistula) macintyre's dude ranch is often frequented by business casual gordon, at least since resident water witch, jessica, was 13. but jessica can find much more than fresh spring water with that divining rod  buried "tray-shure," lost jewelry, dead bodies, even a talisman that will keep her from dressing like a slut and raising drinks with a phony beat and a suzanne pleshette look-alike while hypnotized by a disembodied head. evil, evil evil.

yes this movie features a gal named jessica who says everything is evil and she causes trees to land on people too (well she only causes a tree to fall once, but she does say everything is evil). this movie is about a farm that apparently rents out rooms to people, but offers little else in the way of entertainment. jessica can find things with a stick and she finds the head of an evil guy. of course they don't know this until the owner of the farm's helpers open the box containing the head. the head proceeds to hypnotize everyone it can so it can get to jessica and use her powers to find stuff to help look for his body. this movie has an interesting enough story, but it plays out very bad here. everyone in this flick will get on your nerves at least once.

for all its many flaws, i'm inclined to be charitable towards "thing". there is the nugget of an interesting, creepy, claustrophobic hitchcock style story here. put this in the hands of a writer like theodore sturgeon or (if you prefer british perspective) robert bloch, or the guy who wrote "day of the triffids", and you might have had a nasty, unsettling little spook story that was the best thing in an book anthology of horror and suspense stories.however, someone chose to tell this story as a feature length movie, and a cheap, 2nd rate at that, and so most of the potential is wasted. a story like this really needs a voice like sturgeon's to bring out interesting quirks of character in a better light. his classic story "the -widget-, the -wadget-, and boff" is an example of how he can gather together an isolated group of "ordinary" characters and in the space of 40 pages can turn them into the most amusing, sympathetic and fascinating people you've ever met. a good writer can, with a few chosen words, make the reader "see" some of the most vivid and memorable events ever to scar his emotions.instead, we get a movie where some of the most irritating and unlikeable characters ever made are lumped together and made to interact in unconvincing "where did that come from??" moments that just lie there. (ie the blond psychic girl declaiming that "you're all evil and i hope you are destroyed!"). we get leaden pacing and slow motion blocking and dull sets and stiff actors. i blame the director for the 'stiff and shallow' part. these are all 3rd rank character actors who never made the big time, but they are also 'real' actors, and a good director could have gotten better performances out of them. we get uncalled for lesbian overtones that make the viewer feel uneasy and exploited without delivering any kind of payoff. (if i'm going to have my baser instincts exploited and feel guilty about it, i want done by stuff staged better than this). and we get over an hour of creepy build-up diffused in about 35 seconds in one of the worst anti-climaxes i've ever seen.good things about "thing"? um, well...some of the closeup shots of the warlock's head silently mouthing its directives were pretty effective. the miserly and shrewish widow rang true to life (even if i wanted to stuff a sock in her mouth). the first scene where the big, "simple" ranch hand silently turns on the oily cowboy and kills him had a bit of shock value, because the plot had taken the trouble to establish the big guy as a fairly sympathetic character. and like i said earlier, the idea of an insidious force from the past turning the members of an isolated community against each other is a good one and can sustain interest far above the actual merit of a bad performance.which this definitely is.but, as i said, i'm inclined to be charitable, because the director was probably working under a penurious budget, breakneck time constraints and the best actors he could find for the money. heaven knows how future generations will judge facile crap like "the cave", "wrong turn" or the remake of "house of wax" 40 years from now. i hope they are charitable towards our own tastes in supporting our generations wastes of film stock.

while out divining for water, a young psychic woman named jessica burns (carolyn kearney) stumbles upon something else altogether. she discovers a chest that has been buried for centuries on her aunt's ranch. instead of the treasure her aunt is hoping for, the chest contains the head of gideon drew, a devil worshiper who was beheaded by sir francis drake. telepathically controlling the hired-hand who opened the chest, drew's head goes on a murderous spree in search of the rest of his body  also buried on jessica's aunt's farm. while jessica is certain she feels the presence of evil, can she put a stop to drew's plans and will she be in time to prevent his becoming whole? i thought i was fairly familiar with most of universal's horror output prior to 1960, but this is one universal film from the 50s that certainly gets little mention. while the thing that couldn't die isn't what i would call a "good" movie, it does have a few things going for it. first, the film has some interesting ideas and is actually rather ambitious. director will cowan, whether by luck or intention, is able to give the movie some nice atmosphere from time-to-time. and, the special effects involving the head are certainly creepy. but the whole project is undone by the acting. i'm shocked to learn that any of the supposed "actors" in this thing ever appeared in anything else. you would think that this was a "one and done" type of movie for most of those involved. kearney is the worst offender. she's horrible. also, the thing that couldn't die may have been a bit too ambitious for its own good. given the budget and other limitations, there was no way the movie could aspire to its more lofty ideas. finally, the movie ends rather abruptly. just as things are starting to get interesting, the end. what's that about?

i love this movie. even though i rated it a "4", that's because the acting, the plot and the budget were all slated to the "b" universe even before this movie was released. but that's ok! it is an entertaining film that has a lot to offer! i remember what leonard maltin said about "plan 9 from outer space": a film so bad that it's great! lacking the ufo - alien plot, the thing the couldn't die relies on the supernatural (divination, a buried head looking for it's body, hypnosis, etc) to tell it's story. the acting is stilted, the camera work second class and the settings are limited, but boy! what a movie! this film is available in the bootleg market. if you find a copy, buy it!

yes,the movie is not a piece of art but the first time i watched it i was 10 years old,my parents were out and i stayed home with my two brothers.it was may 1970(i know that because i found a note about the cycle of horror movies that one network had).it's one of the most vivid memories i have with the guys.we ended all in one bed and covered up to the head! our very first horror movie! we kept talking about it for years and laughing about the moment.those were horror movies.nowadays horror movies are always the same.or was it better when we were kids enjoying without analyzing the plot and the cast and the dialogs? most sure it was that.but for me this is a great movie!

hollywood had a long love affair with bogus arabian nights tales but few of these products have stood the test of time. the most memorable were the jon hall, maria montez films which have long since become camp. this one is filled with dubbed songs, anachronistic slang, and slapstick. it's a truly bounteous crop of mesopotamian corn, and pretty near intolerable today. it was nominated for its imaginative special effects which are almost unnoticeable in this day and age, consisting mainly of trick photography. the only outstanding, positive feature which survives is its beautiful color and clarity. sad to say, of the many films made in this genre, few of them come up to alexander korda's original "thief of baghdad". almost any other arabian nights film is superior to this one, though. it's a loser.

this is the worst movie in the world. the only reason i gave it a 2 was because the first 10 minutes were hysterically funny in a "is this for real??" sort of way. it was so cheesy and low budget...they should not have even bothered. there was nudity and violence for the pure sake of having nudity and violence, and the effects were just so so bad you would not believe it (think ketchup as blood, and cabbages for severed heads). do not rent this!!

a majority of exclusively made-for-video low-budget fright flicks from the 80's invariably stink worse than raunchy old socks. this particularly dismal and amateurish no-budget chicago-set bargain basement "nasty necrophiliac nutcase on the loose" bloodbath serves as a depressing affirmation of this borderline ineluctable fact. a bearded, disheveled, long-haired, bead and flower shirt-wearing wild-eyed psycho hippie fruitcake embarks on your standard random gruesome killing spree, graphically slaughtering libidinous young couples who are engaging in strenuous coitus whenever the deranged mansonesque lunatic attacks. (hmm, do i detect a fairly obvious and self-righteously puritanical "have sex and die" message here? gee, could be, man.) boy, is this mentally unbalanced sicko one real way gone pup: after knifing his female victims, our certifiably crackers killer enjoys making love to their freshly slain bodies. (warning: possible *spoiler* ahead. towards the picture's end the corpse-copulating crazy gets rudely interrupted by the cops while he's in the middle of doing the unthinkable with a nubile cadaver, thereby provoking the foul pervert to cut loose with an understandably anguished and ear-splitting cry of "nooo!") now, ain't this gonzo guy a definite sweetheart and a half? too bad this flick is so poorly done; if it had only been made with a modicum of flair and proficiency it could have been a sleazy little gem of a horror exploitation item. alas, wally koz's ham-fisted direction, lamar "larry" bloodworth's stubbornly static and immobile cinematography, frankie "hollywood" rodriguez's insipid, monotonously head-banging "hard rock" score, the pitifully cheap and unconvincing make-up f/x, flat, conspicuously uneasy plywood acting by a hideously all-thumbs and unappealing non-pro cast, lethargic pacing (too much screen time is tiresomely squandered on the police's drab efforts to catch the wacko), an especially lame would-be shocking "surprise" ending (the mystery killer's true identity is guaranteed to have you groaning in disgust), the uniformly boring, incessantly bickering and positively braindead characters, and a steady succession of dull soft-core sex scenes that are about as erotic as watching two slugs mate for 90 minutes straight all add up to one profoundly putrid and unrewarding limp, soggy noodle of a crummy clinker. however, to be fair, this film does possess one stellar virtue: the mad-dog slasher has unquestionably excellent taste in garishly tropical, louder-than-thunder day-glo hawaiian shirts.

well, i didn't know what to expect from 555. matter of fact, i had never even heard of it until a few months ago. but, being a collector of just about all types of horror i figured i would go ahead and grab this obscure 80's slasher.basically the storyline has to do with a killer that kills every 5 years for 5 nights in a row. what the third 5 in the title means... nobody knows. anyway, the killings start as the killer searches for young teenagers fooling around in obscure places. he decapitates the men and brutally knifes the woman to death. after this, he proceeds to rape the dead corpse. the police think they have a lead on the killings but really have no idea what is going on. how will they find the killer? does anybody care?this movie is filled with some of the worst actors i have ever seen. no wonder none of these actors went on to do anything else, literally. the three lead actors consist of two detectives and a "sexy" female reporter. i am being sarcastic when i say sexy, she is about as un-sexy as it gets. the two detectives are like watching tweedle dee and tweedle dum. one of them underacts his part and the other one may have gone to the shatner school of acting. the acting is so bad that it almost forces you to lose your interest in the movie, thus almost putting you to sleep.the only thing holding this terrible movie together is a few decent gore scenes. for a movie on this budget the makers must have put all of there money into the special effects, which still aren't that great.unless you are like me and have to own every single horror movie out there, i would suggest steering clear of this movie. 4/10

oh, the horror! i've seen a lot of gore movies in my day, but this one just makes me gag with with laughter rather than repulsiveness. this is definitely a crazy movie and is very low-budget, i might add, but if you're able to look past the cheap audio, horrible dialogue, ugly girls, the obviously fake gore scenes, and overall cheeziness of the film, then you might find some of this film to be somewhat entertaining. the story is about a copy cat killer who goes on a killing spree every "5th day, of the 5th month, of the 5th year" (wow, how original), and it's up to two detectives (one of whom gave a valiant effort at trying to make the crapy dialogue good) to stop the killer's bloody rampage. the killing scenes (which are done with a plastic toy knife) are pretty brutal (which is a good thing), but very annoying due to the constant repetition of an obviously recorded scream (which is very ear piercing). as for the gore, there's plenty of it but it looks very fake; especially the blood - dude, c'mon, purple blood? but, if you're a fan of gore videos, like myself, then you'll find something in this video to cherish like i did (the crap-talking detective...he's the best thing going for this film). other than that, all you're going to find is a bunch of senseless nudity (which is also a good thing, but too bad the girls are ooogly) and a very idiotic hippy necrophiliac serial killer. sorry, but this one sucks.

well well, i had seen a lot of reviews on this one, and a lot of promo always showing the decapitation scene. but this flick is a tough one. and i mean it by all ways. it's hard to find a copy, because it was a low budget independent release and because mpaa was on the hunt for every copy on vhs, it came out unrated but it had to be rated for the mpaa. so copies disappeared into the underground scene. all people involved in this flick never did anything else in the biz. so it made this flick unique. vhs copies almost never pop up on ebay or other sites and if they do you will pay over a 100$ to get one. but due us connections i was able to catch a release on dvd sold worldwide. limited but it was to be a sort of official one. now and then there are still some screenings of this splatterfest. but is it worth all the hype surrounding it? as said earlier, it is a tough one to catch but also to sit through. there are gory killings, there is necrophilia, there is nudity but there is also a lot of talking between the coppers. and to be honest, if you would like to see the movie in 5 minutes watch the ending, it's a flashback in the killer's mind. the blood flows and indeed it's a splatterfest but not the full 80 minutes, splatter galore for 10 minutes. the quality of the movie is okay, sound okay, no hiss, colors okay, black is black and not blue as in many low budgets. it's okay to watch it but you never will be frightened but it's one to watch with your friends having a beer and a pizza i guess. 555, naaaaaaaaaaaaaaah 333.

always enjoy the classic horror films, however, this film was really a big waste of time and if it were not for john carradine playing the mad man doctor who is able to control human beings through his experiments. this film was made during ww ii and john carradine was a german nazi working to find a human weapon against the entire world. bob steele playing in many roles as a cowboy or gangster and in this picture bob seemed bored to death with his role in this film and acted like this was his first film. mantan moreland, (jeff) gave an outstanding performance with great comedy which helped keep the audience attention. i hate to criticize a film made in 1943, but this is really a big disappointment. if you like john carradine and the roles he played as count dracula throughout many films during the 1940's, you just might like to watch john doing his best.

"revenge of the zombies" is a pretty weak and barely passable zombie effort.**spoilers**traveling in the bayou, larry adams, (robert lowery) and scott warrington, (mauritz hugo) are informed that a friend has deceased. meeting with local dr. von altermann, (john carradine) he repeats the notion that they mysteriously died. while they are staying there, they realize that the help consists of zombies, reanimated dead people who are doing the bidding of their master. as the bodies pile up, he reveals that he has been making the creatures for use in various experiments and all try to stop him before it's too late.the good news: this here gets very little right. the opening is easily it's best, as it's got several great marks for it. from where it starts, with the creepy silhouettes walking in the dark all the way through to the revelations, this one works wonders for both it's mystery and great imagery. the big one is a really scene where the creature emerges from a coffin in a long, slow and creepy shot. these here are all done before the opening credits and is a fun sight. the scenes in the middle where the creature reawakens inside the coffin is pretty chilling and looks really great. the last big positive is the really fun ending. with the sort of ending that feels reminiscent of so many universal attempts, this one fits in with that style. from the creepy reanimation to the real action involved near the swamp, this one is fun and really works with the others to give it's only real positives.the bad news: this one here only has a couple flaws, but they are major ones. the first one is the film's major boredom from inactivity. almost nothing happens in here, mainly due to the tendency to do everything with talking rather than anything else. there's only intermittent scenes relegated to the zombies, yet there's nothing here that devotes any action to the film. this one simply doesn't have any action, and that's what hurts the film. it rarely generates a scenes that keeps the interest going, and at times this makes it feel a lot longer than it really is. the last flaw in the film are it's pathetic excuses for zombies. those used to more modern fare will have a hard time getting any fear out of these creatures, and they really only serve several scenes. this here doesn't treat the zombies as threats, making them even less frightening. little screen-time, nonthreatening nature and un-modern behavior from these zombies really destroys this one. these here are what really hurt the film.the final verdict: with bad zombies and hardly anything worth watching, this one here is a curious effort. those used to modern zombies will find little of interest in this one and come out the same as this one is, while only classic horror fans are advised to give it a shot.today's rating-pg: mild violence

there is not much to say about this one except that it is probably the worst of the early spate of zombie movies (i may get to watch another one, revolt of the zombies [1936], before the month is out). for all star john carradine's intention of building an army in the service of the third reich with them, they are not seen to do much at all!; james baskett (uncle remus from song of the south [1946]!) plays their leader, who also serves as carradine's manservant. black comic mantan moreland reprises his 'fraidy cat' chauffeur role from king of the zombies (1941), as does the exotically named madame sul-te-wan as carradine's housekeeper. unfortunately for carradine, his supreme achievement  the zombification of his wife  brings him all sorts of trouble: not only do her relatives turn up at his remote abode/lab to inquire into her sudden death (which means he has to fake a funeral service!) but she actually proves disobedient and indignant, eventually 'persuading' her fellow zombies to rise against their master!! also involved is cowboy star bob steele (still best-known for his bit in howard hawks' the big sleep [1946]) who plays a u.s. secret agent posing as a nazi posing as a sheriff! thankfully, director sekely would have much better luck with his next genre effort, the day of the triffids (1962).

one of low budget horror schlockmeister actor, john carradine's more animated roles as a implied nazi scientist, who is turning humans into zombies to serve the reich. mindless scuffling brain dead, only able to obey the most simple of orders....bit like staff in mcdonalds.hitler isn't mentioned by name, since america wasn't at war at the time they was filmed, but it's pretty obvious who the bad guys are working for!there seems to be two types of zombies in film, the traditional voodoo type popular in the old black & white films of the 1930's and '40's. blank eyed and just following the commands of someone else as they stumble along. and then there is the type we know from later films like 'the night of the living dead' and 'the evil dead.' still roaming about but with only the intention to kill and eat the flesh and brains of their victims. both have their moments in various movies over the years. 'revenge' features the former zombie type, although, these are particularly goofy looking and would look more at home in an old time freak shows as geeks as they bite the heads off chickens. one black zombie named lazarus with his wild hair, looks like a young don king.as to the plot, the evil doctor decides to make his wife a zombie along with the others and that's where he makes his mistake. even though he lets her keep her strappy heels as a nice womanly touch as he turns her into one of the living dead, she's not happy about it.it all goes horribly wrong and ends in tears, and the moral of the tale must be, never, ever, turn your wife into a zombie, it's just asking for trouble....the film is interesting enough and it quickly rolls along to a finish, but never rises above it's poverty row origins. not a patch on any true zombie classics but fun just the same.

i watched the first show of each series just to see and what a waste of time. the girl from emmerdale she was fat so yeah she should be in fat friend but no one every lost weigh.like itv made a big mistake with this.bad girls is 100times better.i feel that the whole show was just about large people trying to loose weight but never did then they tried to have love storyline oh my god what a a waste of time and also air time. this show has not been repeated on itv2/3/4 yeah thats how good it is.i would say do not by th box sets just a waste of money.beware

this movie was terrible. the acting was awful. the script was awful. what was even worse were the camera shots and sound. half the time the voices did not match up with the actors lips, and different camera angles in the same scene would be completely different hues. the worst part had to be when one of the actors was at the top of a huge cross-shaped building. the building had to have been 50 stories high, and probably 100 feet wide. however, when the actor was on top of it in another shot, they had "recreated" the top of the building. the building's width had been reduced to about eight feet wide. how could a building hundreds of feet high be eight feet wide? i know the film was low budget, but it is inexcusable. the movie itself just pushed ideas about a "rapture" then actually having a storyline or point. this reduced the script to mere rubbish, the characters seemed to be selling ideas in their lines rather than conveying emotions and moving the movie along in a direction. it was a complete waste of time watching. the movie gives christians a bad name if it is one of the current best christian films out there.

the back of the dvd for this movie raves, "chey is the quentin tarantino of christian films." this isn't so much an insult to quentin as it is to christian films. this film is poorly written, stiffly acted and edited with a purposeless intensity. the scenes play out in a confusing and unrealistic way and are interspersed with some nice time-lapse photography. flashbacks, fades to grey, freeze frames to tell the time (unimportant in the story) are all done with out any apparent reason other than to give the movie more cinematic credibility. the camera is haphazard, some nice crane shots are cut with ridiculous montages that have no significance. poor blocking and lighting leave the viewer wondering who is talking to who in many scenes. oh and the audio is terrible. the special effects were decent and thankfully limited. but this is all just technical. the movie fails to engage on an emotional level. the dialogue is so fake sounding and the actors seem to have only read it a moment before the camera was rolling. the story... the things that happen in sequence have no motivation behind them. the characters are struggling to take hold of one dimensionality. and the characters have to make a stance on christianity and faith in every single scene. take a queue from m. night, engaging christian films don't have to have the characters saying the name of jesus christ in every scene for the movie to be christian. goodness! please don't try to show this to your unsaved friends with any expectations other than laughter.

this movie was terrible. you couldn't fast forward fast enough to get to the end of this movie. it came down to the last 20 minutes of the film and i literally hit the eject button right in the middle of the scene. it was one of the worst movies i have ever experienced. worse than all dean cain films combined. to start, the acting was terrible. i realize that the main actors were from the cast of survivor, but one would think that any tv experience would have given them a little more talent. the movies other main problem was the campy visual effects and the poor film quality. in the movies defense, the theme of the show was well intentioned and the story was all right.

the other reviewer was completely correct about this one. the writing was awful, the acting was awful, the subject was awful. the actors looked like they were not really into the movie, like they almost *had* to be there. there were some unique camera effects, but they were not really germane to the story (or what there was of a story), and they weren't produced particularly well. i suppose they were trying to piggyback on the success (can i say that?) of the other eschatologically influenced movies (omega code, left behind). and yes, it does make christians embarrassed when these types of movies are produced. i would not recommend this movie to anyone, especially a non-christian.

i watched the beginning twice, could not make sense of it, and it bothered me for the whole movie.so, work this out with me: wayne (the good guy) jumps on the stagecoach, disarms the drivers (!), steals the money (?!), and takes off.disarmed, one driver is then killed and the other wounded by the bad guys. thanks to wayne, who disarmed them, and then watched it happen.then wayne drops the money in the dirt, rescues the girl, rides into town, chuckles it up with yak (too bad about the dead guy, i guess)...and then later says he "found" the money back at the scene. and everyone's okay with that.and he's the good guy? and i'm pretty sure there weren't small, hand-held flashlights at the time. and bell did his first phone demo in 1876... were they in houses then? am i thinking too hard about this one? normally, i'm happy to suspend judgment to enjoy a movie, but this one bothered me. and that's a sign the move didn't really work for me.

lone star productions sure churned them out in the 1930's, and "star packer" has the feel of one of the more rushed ones. john wayne is u.s. marshal john travers, investigating a crooked hoodlum known only as "the shadow", responsible for stealing cattle, stage holdups and the like, and giving orders from behind the door of a phony wall safe. yakima canutt is travers' trusty indian sidekick, appropriately named as... well, "yak".early on, we find out that cattlemens union head matt matlock (george pre-gabby hayes) is really the shadow; the dead giveaway is when he offers to buy out his (supposed) niece anita's half of the matlock ranch, since "this is no place for a girl". as anita, verna hillie doesn't have much to do in the film, although in a comic moment, she gets to use a six shooter to blast the butt of one of the villains in a night time scare raid.there are a few curiosities in the film - for one, wayne's character alternately rides a white horse and a dark horse in the first half of the film. in what could have been a neat device, a hollowed out tree stump used by a henchman is located right in the middle of the street. and finally, the movie doesn't truly live up to it's name, as sheriff travers never wears a badge throughout the film, that is, a star packer without a star.the horse chases, the runaway stage scenes, the stagecoach off the cliff (another curiosity, the horses conveniently get loose from the stage) are all pretty standard stuff. but john wayne fans will want to see this one for the charisma he displayed early on in his career. for those more critical, the white kerchiefs worn around the forehead by the good guy posse could only mean that they all had a headache.

with great expectations i went to see this film, spain's contribution to the oscar-race this year. part from being completely pointless, banal, pathetic, badly written, edited, acted and directed, the movie is too long. it fails in delivering the "message" it tries to give, fails in its storytelling, clumsy historical settings and above all in its rhythm. there are some so extreme misfires i haven't seen in a movie in a long time (the story of lucas whose dead sister lives in his head, the divine revelations, all that lizard nonsense). the spanish-speaking audience around me was yawning and rapidly losing patience, and some of the commentaries i overheard was whether the members of the spanish academy had taken drugs before choosing the film for the oscar contest.

obabakoak is a bunch of short stories with an only common point: the little vasque town of obaba. in this film, the director tries to explain some of these stories by using a young reporter as a continuum. the result is a strange film, as it has any main character (the movie spends about 20 min. to each tale) other than the town of obaba. any story is really well explained and the fact is that they result very boring. it was by far the best film of the year in spain, but, well, that's not saying too much. the only good thing of the film is the precious scenarios. it is filmed in a very precious valley and it is more enjoyable to spend the time watching the scenario rather than being aware of the story.

i am looking at all the good reviews about this film and i start thinking to myself... am i going crazy..? can't i see the beauty from a film like this..? am i just dumb enough to not understand the message this film is trying to point out? i don't know.. maybe one of those lizards entered in my head and ate all my brains as well. the film idea was going nowhere... i was sure it would have a foggy end, and of course... it did! nothing exceptional... not even the landscapes (i hopped that being placed in a mountain village at least the landscapes would be nice.. but no). just a lame story about a crazy teacher, and of course her crazy students... now all grown up, each of them.. with his/her own fixed ideas. and boy some of those ideas were stupid.. like the lizard story for example. at a moment i thought i was watching x files.. with the lizard entering in the ear and all. no.. from my point of view this movie is a waste of time (not to say money if u pay for the ticket) the only part that i did like was the acting of the young blue eye "german" kid... he played very well and convincing for his age... the rest... nothing! i read the previous review and i think the script writer and the director were both on drugs when they came up with those ideas. well considering that there are a lot of people that enjoyed this film... i think to myself again.. maybe i am the crazy one. advice.. don't waste your time with this!

although this starts out promisingly, a woman in a car is weaving around dark roads in the middle of the night in the middle of the forest until she almost hits a man holding a lizard! this gave me the impression that we were going to see something special, something almost david lynchian (if there is such a term), but unfortunately, the film starts to go everyplace, not having a core center, just sort of meandering story about a woman trying to solve a mystery of a small town. the character study goes all over the place, and i couldn't really care for any of the characters it seems, especially when some of the story all of a sudden goes into flashback mode. i had some hopes for this movie, but all in all, it was a bit of a letdown.

i saw this movie and thought it was a sleeper. sometimes i can get into intellectual romantic movies. this movie just did not move me. i felt like it was about one hour too long. camille is portrayed as a very sympathetic sculptor, who loses just about everything. i thought the whole movie was just sad, and downcast. if you like tragedies, you might like this. i just thought it was too long, which meant it has many unnecessary scenes, which ultimately lead to about one hour of boredom. i would not recommend this movie. if you want to see a good romantic tragedy go watch titanic.

while the design and locations and photography are strong assets in this film; it is a turgid and melodramatic affair which demonstrates the limits of cinema to convey truth.the case is the use of the soundtrack music: a mix of gustav mahler and andrew lloyd-webber that plays constantly and loudly, and would have made max steiner grimace at its over use as it instructs the audience how difficult; how ecstatic; how tortured it is to be an artist. and then it really counts the story elides the details at the end.this heightened and kitsch exploitation of emotions was once well ridiculed by peter ackroyd about a yukio mishima book: this is not writing, this is barbara cartland. precisely the same critique can be made of this film: a deceptive, mawkish vanity project.

forget the lousy acting, that can be forgiven in this sort of film. or even the terrible, unnatural dialog and illogical events (if my subtitles actually reflected what was said). far worse is the blatant absence of a skillful or experienced director who maybe took a holiday with the editor while the film was being made? watching the film, it feels completely out of date even though it was 'only' made 7 years ago. a computer virus as a portal to the afterlife? lol? a dial up internetconnection? clucky ghost images photoshopped on pictures ("he! look over there...is that..is that a face?" -zoom in on face- -oops, sound breaks off- 'chop' -next scene- ), scenes and sequences are poorly edited and as a result don't flow at all. you'll be watching a girl finding a corpse still hanging from the knot in one scene and then literally 10 seconds later seeing her again at some place apparently unaffected, smiling and going about.apart from the many problems i have with the movie in terms of production-value, it is also painfully long and repetitive and thus utterly boring.i recommend 'shutter' in stead, an oriental (thai) horror movie done well.

i never fell asleep during a movie. never. this movie did the impossible.while many people claim the superiority of japanese horror films over their american counterparts, this movie was a lesson in over abundance. as in, the movie was 30 minutes too long. it would have helped if the movie had a little more movement in the plot and the camera work, but instead, all we got were awkward silences and a lot of slow movement. the acting was absolutely terrible, bordering on bad student film levels while everyone struggled to ad-lib something called a script. did these people even get any direction? were they coaxed to be boring and dull? either therory wouldn't surprise me.what was even worse was the rather unscary make-up involved with the creatures from the other side. either way, they all stunk. don't watch this film. that's all i can say (unless you're an insomniac).

do not see this film. in most cases, such as that of ju-on and the grudge, the japanese film are infinitely better than the american remake. however, this movie was terrible. the ghosts, much like a trick or treater dressed as a sheet ghost moan and wheeze in an attempt to be scary in the absence of good makeup or special effects and the acting is just horrible. the story itself is inconsistent and confusing, not everything is explained leaving the film to go from bad to worse. do not waste your time with this movie, it's not worth it and i am sure that there are more entertaining things to do - like watching paint dry.

i can appreciate movies with subtitles from foreign countries and specially the ones in which the subtitles are weak and don't really seems to follow the story or really make sense, but this movie had too many parts that didn't really make sense.all in all, i can admit to a few scary and freaky parts, but they are repetitive, i felt like i was watching a loop trailer; seems like it was a short film shot with different actors.in the veins of ringu and grudge but not even close the the hype...the excessive length killed the thrill.unless you are a die hard fan of these types of movies (wich i thought i was), don't waste your time on this one.

would be promising if it were a student film. never seems to know where it's going next, as if they decided on each next scene as they were making the film. as a result, much repetition and a deadening pace. there's an absolutely confusing procedure by which the ghosts affect people in this world: it involves the internet, phone calls, a computer science experiment, a suspicious grad student, withdrawn behavior, red rooms, dark stains, and _then_ suicides. good luck figuring out the connections, or when a character is a ghost yet or just acting strangely. characters are barely sketched, which could be ok, but they're completely uninteresting. it's far too long and ends just when it reaches a promising scenario, although the conclusion is nonsensical. weakest moment: when "the boss" sits down to give some incoherent advice.

i saw this movie because every review i read of it said that it was one of the scariest movies of the new millennium. i really don't understand what all of the hype was about. for one thing, the dialogue in this movie was laughably bad ("what if something strange is going on?"...what????). the acting didn't blow my socks off either. it could have been because the script barely gave the actors anything to work with....the characters are purely 2-dimensional to me and i didn't give a hoot about them at all. another thing is that the movie extremely boring. extremely. sure, there are a couple of "jolts" here and there, but for the movie's 112 minute length, it sure didn't use it's time up wisely. most of the movie contains characters talking about stuff that had barely anything to do with the plot. what was the point of that??to top it off, the movie makes no sense. yes, i believe i understood the intentions of the ghosts, but how that fits into the events that actually occur in the movie is beyond me. also, much of the movie is played out in little vignettes, which makes the story hard to follow at times. and don't even get me started with the ending. what exactly happened there?i can give kurosawa credit for placing some truly frightening images throughout the film. there are very creepy shots of ghosts and other unsettling images. if they reflected more on those images and elaborated on them, it would have made the movie much stronger. but they didn't, and instead elaborated more on social commentary, which was interesting, but again, portrayed in an extremely dull way. yes, it's a message movie. okay, fun. i'll just get the message of my review right out here in the open: find a better way to spend your spare time than watching this.

i was so excited to finally watch "pulse" after receiving it from amazon, and i have to say i was utterly disappointed. i perhaps think i was too hyped up. i had expectations set by its fans that simply couldn't be met. after loving other asian horrors, i thought i knew this would find a place in my heart.the story was slow, painfully so. i am a diverse fan of horror. i love the brutal, bloody craziness of "the devil's rejects" and i love equally the steady, growing macabre of "a tale of two sisters". "pulse" offered little from either spectrum, sadly.along with the sluggishness of the plot, it was also very muddled. i hadn't a clue why characters were doing what they were doing and how what they were doing would help their problem. it seemed as if the director spouted off the plot in a sentence or two and the rest was improf from our actors. unlike "a tale of two sisters", which also has a rather hard-to-follow plot line, "pulse" clears up very little at the end and left me feeling frustrated, confused and uninterested in the characters' endeavors. my closing statement about the plot was its inconsistency. at first it seemed as if the story was about the ghost world overflowing and their medium of escaping is the internet. that's a damn original idea. i like that. but as the plot drones on, plot-holes and unexplained happenings rearing their heads in, it seems the director switched to some apocalyptic tale (as evident by the ending) that just hasn't been clear enough throughout to execute.i realize the dreariness of the shots and the setting was intentional to make the viewer feel bleak and isolated, but the dullness of the movie was only intensified by the grainy, shadowy surroundings. i will admit there was a certain feel of surrealism with the movie, but that may have just been my attention waning in and out.the actions of some of the characters are a little bit ridiculous as well, and perhaps if i was more enthralled by the story i would've been able to suspend more disbelief but as well myself being unmotivated so too were some of the characters. like i mentioned previously, the logic behind what certain characters did were absent and contributed to the incoherence of the plot. perhaps it was a result of the plot's incoherence that the characters do questionable things. to be honest i don't really care.the acting was decent. certainly nothing outstanding but nothing terrible either. no outliers to mention on either side of brilliant or plain awful.now i'll stop sounding so sour and mention that there were a handful of creepy moments. one towards the end especially that if there were more like it throughout, i would've enjoyed this movie (almost) wholly. i thought whenever the website was shown it was pretty unsettling, as well as some of the ghostly encounters our two main characters face. the things that went on between these ghastly run-ins were just too lackluster, baffling and "wtf" for me to truly appreciate.now for something pertaining to the dvd itself... magnolia's release of "pulse" comes with subtitles, yes, but the subtitles are off. they aren't said at the correct time of the character's speech. it may sound nit-picking but it bothered me a little and it may bother some others. i think this is the only north american release of the film though so you either have to deal or watch dubbing (never watch dubbing!!!) i tried to like the film, i really did. i wanted this film to live up to the hype... but sadly, it fell flat for me. if you're looking for other creepy asian cinema i can recommend you "audition", "shutter", "a tale of two sisters", "strange circus" and "marebito" -- all of which are more my palette.

kairo, or pulse as it's known amongst english speaking audiences, is set in tokyo & starts as sunny plant sales employee michi kudo (kumiko aso) decides to visit her friend taguchi (kenji mizuhashi) to enquire about a computer disk he's been working on, when she gets to his place he gives her the disk but then rather inconsiderately commits suicide in front of her. meanwhile a student named ryosuke kawashima (haruhiko kato) has recently hooked up to the internet & keeps getting spooky messages & images on his monitor so he ask's computer whizz harue karasawa (koyuki) whats happening, she doesn't really know but it seems that the place where people's spirits go when they die is full & they need somewhere else to go & earth is as good a place as any, right? these spirits don't like sharing either so they sort of make people commit suicide or turn them into ashes or something like that, i don't really know because the films a bit of a mess...this japanese production was written & directed by kiyoshi kurosawa & right off the bat i have to say i hated kairo, i hated everything about it & it proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that asian cinema can produce something as crap as any american filmmaker. the script is an overlong mess, the thing simply doesn't make any sense with scenes which seem like they are from a different film, sequences which make no logical sense or are not explained in any way & kairo is also the most downright boring film i've sat through this year. at two hours long this is a real chore to sit through, i really wanted to fast-forward it but i'm fair if nothing else so i stuck it out to the bitter end & frankly wished i hadn't. there are so many things wrong with kairo, i suppose the filmmakers were going for a surreal ambiguous & deliberately incoherent feel but those are traits which i despise in a film unless they are done properly. then there's the whole internet thing which i just couldn't relate to at all, i use the internet all day & it's not in the least bit scary to me in any way. then there's the fact that kairo as a film provided zero entertainment value for me, maybe i'm a neanderthal but i kind of like the films i watch to entertain me, make some sort of sense & not bore me to death.director kurosawa has made the ultimate insomnia cure as far as i'm concerned, if you have trouble getting to sleep stick this in the dvd & you be fast asleep within 10 minutes i guarantee you. i didn't think kairo was scary in the slightest, the whole internet thing was laughable & as for scary you should see some of the penis enlargement pop-up ads i get, now that's scary! i hate this film, i hate this film, i'm sorry i just need to make that basic point again, twice. forget about any action, tension or gore as there isn't any. if you have a very nervous disposition then there are maybe a couple of scenes which might creep you out otherwise this is kiddie friendly pg rated stuff all the way. urgh.the film looks so dull & boring it's untrue, the camera just sits there for very long shots & when it does move it moves very slowly, this has all the style of a mexican soap opera. since kairo is sub titled it's difficult to judge the original performances so i won't bother, it's hard to care for someone when they don't even speak the same language & you don't know what they are saying.kairo is crap, i hated it & it's as simple & straight forward as that. just because it's an asian flick doesn't automatically make it any good & the mess of a story, the plot holes, the fact it makes no sense & it's an absolute bore means kairo would rightly be torn to shreds by people if it were an american production. the worst film i've seen this year by some distance. kairo got a hollywood remake as pulse (2006).

this film is about a gap that exists between the real world and the world of the dead. there's a lot of mumbo-jumbo about the internet (i.e., if you install a program on the computer, you see dead folks--much like if you play a videotape you'll die in ringu). frankly, most of this seemed rather silly and lost me. what i did find interesting is the idea that the dead live within their own separate existence--being totally alone for eternity. this was sobering and fascinating.i love japanese films and have seen a huge number compared to most americans. however, one genre that has become popular in recent years that i just can't relate to very well are these horror films. i know they are super popular--especially since they seem to be remade so often in the states. i've seen both ringu as well as the ring, ju-on and the grudge and was rather ambivalent despite their popularity. about the only recent horror film i really liked from japan was seance--a reworking of the great british film, seance on a wet afternoon. and what, do i think, made seance different? well, unlike the other films as well as kairo, gobs and gobs of money weren't spent on special effects or trying to scare the audience--instead, the emphasis was on the story. the bottom line is that these other films are a lot like american films like halloween or friday 13th--with scary things jumping out just to scare the audience and plot is purely secondary (at best). for me, i want story--not cheap thrills or ghosts as the primary focus of the film.with a relatively high rating, i know i am in the minority, but i just don't find this a very satisfying film. all too often, minor things occur that might startle someone slightly--but the characters begin screaming and crying and acting as if to say "this is the scariest film ever made so you'd better start shaking". well, i think it just tries too hard and i wish it had focused more on the afterlife seen at the end of the film and plot progression--not scare tactics.

gritty drama? emotionally powerful? blah! the bbc has lost out big time to masterful productions such as the wire, sopranos and carnivale from hbo. okay, so the budget may be a lot smaller but 'the street' last night was badly acted, predictable, unrealistic, stereotypical, insensitive and a big fat waste of time. tv (british tv) is not as good as it used to be and is falling further and further behind the american productions.there was no sense of brutal violence from the 'local gangster'. there was no indication that this man was 'insane' enough to beat up a man he has respected for such a long time. there was no remorse when he did it and this shouldn't be the sort of character that would back down when bob hoskins called his son a pansy, in a display of 'bravery'.i wish i was more eloquent to express my disdain for this show, but i am not and although i can't prove my point well enough, believe me when i say that this was rubbish, shock tv, that provides no real inward looking perspective on life.1/5 stars.

well,this movie is really "plumped" haha get it? thats kinda like the attitude of this movie. the plot is just a copy of pulp fiction,okay thats acceptable,but to make this piece if "plump" (haha)! is really unbelievable.the storyline is so pathetic,and the whole thing only gathered a few laughs. it did try making a few jokes from various other movies,and it failed most of the times. i mean,i do have a sense of humor,but this isnt really the way to go to get a laugh. most of the supposedly "funny" moments are completely ironic. the film is quiet short running at around 75 minutes overall. they could have done a much funnier job,seeming they made fun of a blockbuster film,they were gambling,and hey! i think they lost!in overall plump fiction,is "plumpable" but you wont gather much at all!worth watching over and over again?: no once is enough,actually its more than enough!so is it worth the rent? ummm..as i said,its "plumpable",but you will only gather a few "plumps" from it!overall out of 10: a 4 out of 10!

...about this film was the title song. after 30 minutes, i discontinued watching because it was so lame. bad story, bad actors, bad movie. if you want to watch a good movie, watch pulp fiction instead.

if you watched pulp fiction don't see this movie. this movie is not funny. this is the worst parody movie ever. this is a poor attempt of parody films.the cast is bad. the film is bad. this is one of the worst pictures ever made.i do not recommend plump fiction. i prefer the original pulp fiction by the great quentin tarantino. this is one of the worst parody films ever made.plump fiction is not a good movie. it is not funny. it is so dumb and vulgar.

this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen. its been a few years since i saw it and nothing has come close since then and i doubt that there ever will be a movie produced that is as bad as this. it tries to make fun of a variety of different movies, for example 'nell' (!) and instead of funny its just pathetic. whatever you do, don't rent or by this garbage and if someone throws it at you....turn around and run the other way!!

the worst movie ever made. if anyone asks you what is the worst movie you've ever seen - tell them plump fiction. of all the movies i've ever seen this gotta be the most lame experience. even the poorest sequels are pure masterpieces compared

...when this movie was on.what a bore. an attempt at humor, but really not pulling it off too well. some good ideas were cast, and the actors makeup and wardrobe were ok.i expected a lot more, unfortunately i couldn't sit through any more of it, i switched off halfway through the video, and ejected the tape, went to the rental store to get my money back...

..this movie being one of them.i remember, in the middle of the movie, me and my friend justlooked at each other, shaked our heads and laughed.. in despair.see it if you wish, if you feel that you have the time to wasteand don´t mind 1.5 hrs of catatonia.

this can hardly be called a good movie, actually it's not even close. but i have to say, that there was a few things that made me... not laugh, not giggle, but something like that. the resovoir dogs parody was one of them. the rest are not important enough to be remembered.to be honest, i was a little disappointed by this movie. the plot sounded like an idea, but it quickly fell to the ground. the whole thing was just to messy and the actors where not good for the characters; most of them simply overacted. there was also a whole lot of unessecary sequences, that was a total waste of film. i do realize that it would make the movie about 20 min shorter, but it would only make it better.now, with the good and the bad things lined up, let's go to the conclusion: two out of six toilet seats up for this one.

this is a spin off of pulp fiction. i thought that it would be good for a few decent laughs. well it turns out that this movie really was terrible. the whole plot doesn't follow on the pulp fiction plot. it turns to other movie like forrest gump and more. some laughs came out of this movie, but all and all it totally took 90 minutes of my life away from me. if you are thinking of renting this movie, please don't it will waste 90 minutes of your life. reconsider renting this and go on and find a movie that actually makes sense. please if there is a plump fiction 2, i will definitely not go on and rent the sequel. just giving a heads up for those out there.

now first let me say i love god awful movies. especially horror films mainly. i watched hundreds of movies on mystery science theater 3000 with no pain. but this is the absolute worst film on the planet!!! i had to turn it off it was so bad. it was unfunny and just plain unwatchable. give me 3 back to back viewings of manos the hands of fate or monster a-go-go over this any day. avoid this film like the plauge!! now excuse me while i go gouge out my eyes to cleanse them of the filth i had to watch to get a decent judgement for this film. only one decent gag in the part i watched was the hitmen now are an extermination pair for hitmen exterminators. even that wasn't to great of a gag.

like the beauty of the jungle, jessica alba's gorgeous smile and sultry looks loom over the film, but alas they are the only two things worth watching this film for. when in theory we should be watching for the narrative.the plot is thin on the ground, and hard to believe. as beautiful as jessica alba is, she doesn't add any of the spark that she injected into the credible 'dark angel' series. since dark angel it seems that alba has been reduced to mere eye candy(but what eye candy!), and is the sole reason for putting her into films.the concept of the sleeping dictionary is daft and implausible, with little character development (or character for that matter) to make us want to undertake the 109 minutes run time with this world. despite the films short running time, it still manages to feel to long and too laboured.it seems a shame that such talent such as brenda blethyn, emily mortimer, bob hoskins are wasted on a threadbare narrative which barely raises a pulse. this film seriously misses a trick, an exotic setting, a more than capable cast, with lovely cinematography, and a chance to utilise the themes and the dualistic concepts of 'civilisation'. but there is little narrative to speak of, no drama, no sense we are watching a story of love, more a story of lust and woman happy to please men without question. lets be honest, if jessica alba was freely allowing you to sleep with her, do you seriously think you'd be able to concentrate on learning a tribal language? therein lies the great problem, both in suspension of disbelief, and also what the female characters are limited and reduced to. take for example the fact that jessica alba's character undergoes the mental and physical tribulation of pregnancy and birth to her forbidden love, yet all we see is her looking lovely and curvy one minute, then lovely and curvy, with a baby, the next.it's a sorry state of affairs to see a film with promise not live up to anything near it's potential. i could write endlessly of the films flaws, but it pains me to do so. the film looks good, the premise could have been made into a lovely film, but sadly it wasn't to be.

yes, it's true that it was jessica alba who leads me to this movie, because without her, i should have never pick it.but, i find it long, dull and above all, unoriginal. all along, i thought that the story was full of clichés and the directing very boring. so it was a surprise to see that the director and writer are the one and same person. i take notice to remember to avoid all his next movies.it's a pity because all good things were at hand: malaysia is a beautiful jungle, it was the british empire and the cast is wonderful: jessica knows how to open her soul and for one time, she has found an appropriate movie for this. bob hoskins shows a great experience and he should have won an award for this role.the only positive thing is that it makes me open a world-map to locate this island because if you guess it happens in south asia, you don't know where exactly! ah, the little plane flight with red lines in the indiana jones movie!!!

i just saw a terrible film called the sleeping dictionary. one reviewer on four word film review (www.fwfr.com) got it right right when he wrote, "from a to zzzzzzzzz." the story is about an english colonialist jerk that comes to malaysia to "civilize the savages" so to speak and ends up falling in love with his sleeping dictionary. a sleeping dictionary is a native malaysian prostitute fluent in english that services englishmen colonialists and teaches them her native language in return for ... well the movie never really makes that clear, but i can only assume he gives her money or something. needless to say, the movie focuses a lot more on the "sleeping" part than on the "dictionary" part of the job description. things get complicated for our young hero when the forbidden love affair gets compounded by her culture, his soap opera domestic situation, and his own boundless stupidity in every major decision he makes throughout the film.so yes, the movie has some major flaws, but on the other hand, it delivered exactly the two things i rented it for in the first place: a beautifully photographed exotic location, and an even more beautifully photographed and exotic woman that plays the sleeping dictionary, jessica alba. my friend told me that this crappy movie was her at her most beautiful and damn was he right. she's not a great actress, and doesn't quite pass for malaysian, and its pretty obvious that they use a body double for the nudity, but who cares? jessica alba has that rare face and figure that's more than just sexy, but also beautiful in the way that a vivaldi violin concerto or a rembrandt painting is.(p.s. sorry to all you feminists out there who discourage objectifying women, the "male gaze," etc. etc., but i hope you can understand that i mean no disrespect.)

based on a fairly bland "best seller," this film - like most other lifetime movies - played out more like a reenactment than an actual movie. the only difference here was that meredith baxter wasn't in it. the women in this don't age even over a span of like 20 years and the acting in general is pretty bad.the characters in this were all cliché and one-dimensional. the story was of the cheesy nature. i wouldn't recommend it, but it's the kind of thing that people who loved the book and people who watch that network all the time will think is great. i only watched it because my girlfriend wanted to see it so she wouldn't have to read the book her sister loaned to her. it wasn't made for someone like me - my girlfriend cried a little at the end though, so she didn't think it was as terrible as i did.

who is minding the store here? how could any producer/network executive/director let a crew stick the skeeziest fakest plastic palm trees in film history in the sands of a wintry canadian beach and try to fob it off on us as the tropics? those trees were to real palm trees what a pink tinsel k-mart christmas tree is to real fir. and who let dermot mulroney go in front of the camera with painted-on grey hair that wouldn't have passed muster in a high school play? and didn't any of the geniuses doing quality control on this thing think to correct the (excellent) canadian actor when he said gaz instead of gas? everybody involved with this plodding slug of a "movie"--writer, director, actors--has done not just good but brilliant work elsewhere. paced way too fast between events and deadly slow within them, devoid of any emotion except the obvious, expository and contrived--maybe this only seems like one of lifetime's worst movie because of all the red carpet hype with which it was presented. and i'm saying this as somebody who love lifetime. what gives, folks?all of that said, a certain actress's work at a certain critical turn in the movie (and if you've seen it you'll know exactly what i'm talking about) was so brilliant that the movie would have gotten a 10 from me if that was the whole movie. unfortunately it was only about five seconds of it.

the memory keeper's daughter in the form of a novel by kim edwards was a highly successful bestseller and probably was featured in more reading groups than any other novel during its circulation. so what happened when the novel became a made-for-television movie? perhaps it is the below mediocre screenplay (oops!, teleplay!) by john pielmeier that consistently galumphs along in an awkward pedestrian fashion removing all sense of credibility to the story. perhaps it is the cut and paste direction by mick jackson that misses the pacing and character delineation. perhaps it suffers from the cinematography of an uncredited source or the 'liquid tears' musical score by daniel licht. for whatever of these (or all of these) reasons, this novel-to-film survives because it does make a good case for educating the public about the capabilities of those born with down syndrome. and for that it is worthy of attention. dr. david henry (dermot mulroney), a successful orthopedic doctor, is married to the beautiful norah (gretchen mol) and their lives are becoming changed by their pregnancy. on a stormy winter night in kentucky norah goes into labor and the henry's rush to a nearby clinic where david delivers his wife (the doctor is caught in a snowstorm) with the assistance of his old friend, nurse caroline gill (emily watson). after the delivery of a perfect boy child (paul) norah continues to be in labor and (surprisingly...) delivers an unexpected (!) twin girl. david and caroline immediately recognize that the little girl (phoebe) is a 'mongoloid' (this is before the use of the term down syndrome) and david, having a history of losing a little sister because of a birth defect) decides to send phoebe to an asylum for the mentally challenged: caroline is to make the delivery and norah is told the second twin died at birth. caroline follows instructions, sees the conditions of the 'home' where phoebe is to be deposited, shrinks in horror, and decides to keep the child. aided by a friendly trucker, caroline changes her solitary existence and mothers phoebe, finding a new life in her trucker's pittsburgh. norah insists on a formal funeral for phoebe - a fact that deeply disturbs david's psyche, and the henry's life goes on with only the one child paul, leaving submerged pains about the lack of phoebe's presence. norah gifts david with a camera ('peoples lives are like a camera, that's where they live - in a room captured by a moment') and david becomes obsessed with photography. norah grieves, drinks, and loses david's attention, while david traces phoebe's existence with caroline - sending money and letters to pittsburgh. paul (tyler stentiford to jamie spilchuk) grows up, discovers his mother's infidelities and is angered about his father's lack of communication and understanding, and decides to fulfill his goal of becoming a musician, and off to juilliard he goes. meanwhile phoebe (krystal hope nausbaum) has matured into a very highly adapted young girl, and the manner in which the broken marriage of the henrys happens and the healing atmosphere of phoebe's and paul's lives coupled with the courage that has supported caroline gill's struggle to gain acceptance in the world for those born with down syndrome forms the conclusion of the film. the cast of well-known actors tries hard, but only emily watson is able to resurrect a credible character from this squishy script. jamie spilchuk gives evidence of a young actor with much promise. dermot mulroney and gretchen find it difficult to mold empathetic characters form the corny lines they are given to deliver. the film is a mess, but the message about acceptance of down syndrome children and adults is an important one. grady harp

i usually don't write reviews for shows unless i've seen them in full. however, there were so many positive views of this show on here i felt it was necessary to balance it out with a bit of realism.this show is hysterically bad. i don't think it was meant to be, but it is. i see that there's lots of praise being showered upon the show, and i honestly can't understand why--- this show is so poorly acted, the dialogue is so awful, and the plots are thin around their holes.i think that this show is interesting in that it is a definite litmus test of your standards. some elements of the show work, and perhaps those elements are just more important to some people than those that don't work, which make the show nearly unwatchable to people like me.if you enjoy making fun of a show as you watch it, anticipating clichéd lines and such, this can be an enjoyable show to ridicule, if you have that sort of time on your hands.the pilot is a pretty fair example of the whole show. if the nonsense saccharin cliché ending doesn't leave you in a dumb shock, then this may be a show for you.

the only thing it has to offer is the interesting opposites of tru and jack, their choices and viewpoints, and the philosophical questions that it raises. tru feels that she is helping people who aren't supposed to die, and jack feels that they are supposed to die, and she is messing with fate's plan, or the universe's plan, or such-whatnot.but she is obviously able to change things, so there is obviously no such thing as fate in the series' metaphysics. jack has no basis for believing that there is. and very conveniently, tru never asks him the right questions. nobody does. which obviously proves that the makers of the series don't have an answer.there simply is no plot!instead, they leave it murky in order for the series to be able to continue with it's boring girl stuff, only occasionally interrupted by tru and jack's racing against each other towards ends that are unknown...it turns out that there is nothing to any of it. a teenage pop series with that pretends to be something else.your time will be better spent sleeping.

tru calling was good but it could have been great. the concept was intriguing and allowed for seriously strange and frightening story lines that might have been explored in future. unfortunately the writing and an actor let the show down.the writing wasn't too bad but there were holes. in episode 13, "drop dead gorgeous", an incredibly toxic poison was supposedly used to kill the victim. this was so toxic and killed so quickly the victim had no time to run or even scream for help. yet there was no plausible explanation for how the killer obtained such a powerful poison.in episode 15, "the getaway", the off-duty policeman responded unrealistically. in the second diner scene he (meekly) tells the robber to drop the gun and when she doesn't follow the order, and in fact turns the gun in his direction, he allows it to turn into a standoff and then escalate into a hostage situation  the very situation he'd been warned about. his response should (would) have been to shoot the robber when she failed to follow his order and upon her turning the gun on him. there are other faults in the stories but i'll leave it with these two examples. in spite of the writing faults i did like the show.the other problem i had was that i just could not accept eliza dushku in this roll. in my opinion she is too inexperienced and lightweight to carry this part. she never walked anywhere, she marched; and far too often she came to an abrupt stop on her mark. she also lacked any really emotional facial expression or intonation. she either has a pensive look or a cute smile; rarely are other emotions apparent. when she tries to appear dramatic she begins her line looking away and 'then' turns her eyes to her fellow actor. or alternatively she begins her line looking at her opposite and then looks away. both are annoying when done as a replacement for true emotion. an example of her lack of intonation is in episode 20, "two weddings and a funeral", during her second wedding speech is devoid of emotion (eg. hearts in our hearts).i liked all of the other actors in their respective parts and they were all believable. with improved writing and a lead change tru calling might have made it.

eliza dushku is a very talented and beautiful actress. she manages to be the rock-steady centre of "tru calling" but that's not enough to rescue her tv series from mediocrity. it's a real shame that a woman as attractive and talented as dushku should go from a meaty supporting role in "buffy the vampire slayer" to this clunker. unoriginal and desperately trying to be hip, "tru calling" fails to excite on any level above hormonal. the eponymous heroine spends a lot of her time running hither and yon across what must be a very small city, in order to avert the deaths of good-looking corpses-to-be that she's already met in the mortuary where she works. despite all the running she does, she always arrives looking like she's just stepped out of a portable air-conditioned dressing room. in every episode, eliza dushku and the rest of the cast struggle to breath life into the bland, characterless screenplays but it's a pointless exercise. "tru calling" just lies on the slab, gazing lifelessly at the ceiling.

the brands in this film, like suit supply, take away from the story, cause it's supposed to be set in the eighties. it's not a very thrilling film. also, the single from intwine on the soundtrack is very bad, it has a chorus that is repeated numerous times', like "i'm a cruel man, i take it all away, i'm a cruel man i'm here to stay.." jeeez couldn't those asswipes have come up with something better than that? i guess they wrote it in a couple of minutes..it's really annoying, just like the product placement in this filmproduct,that cashes in on the controversy and publicity around a criminal who should not be a celebrity like he is now made out to be, but should be forgotten like rats ought to be.

after some quite ok dutch action flicks, like lek and van god los, gerrard verhage wants to make a movie about the life of a dutch mobster. well, mobster is a big word for klaas bruinsma. he isn't a real international big guy like george jung (blow) or pablo escobar. he is just an amsterdam lowlife who made some money by selling soft-drugs. things are often blown up in the netherlands, and this movie is just an other example. but even then, the movie could be very nice if the story was okay told. now there are major jumps in time: one day klaas is just an ordinary drug-boy, the next shot he seems to be a big player in the drug-scene. nobody knows how's that possible (except for those who read the book). the acting is really bad, the non-dutch movie-watchers get to see one of the worst actresses in the netherlands: chantal janzen. when you think she finally gets naked, then you are watching a stand in model. so: bad acting + bad montage + crap story = de dominee.please don't watch it, even if other people say it's good, because it isn't. i've warned you.

to begin with, i have to admit i've never been a big fan of the dutch movie-genre. unfortunately watching de dominee hasn't made me change my mind. it shares some common flaws, like having a plot that's too predictable and linear for my taste. worse however is that the cast has their dialogues as if they were stage-actors in a play. unfortunately this is common too in many dutch movies and, at least to me, makes it impossible to feel any kind of involvement with the main characters.the actor that plays adri (i'm sorry, i forgot his name at the moment) is at least delivering a decent performance, and is one of the reasons i don't rate this movie even worse.another reason is the fact that at least it seems to have had some budget, and the production seems professional. ironically the fact that the acting is often too articulated might not be so much of a problem if you don't speak dutch,although i already warned you that the plot isn't spectacular either, but at least it might make it an acceptable movie to watch.

"de dominee" is based on the life of a real dutch gangster,klaas bruinsma! in the movie he is called klaas donkers! i have my doubts that events presented in the movie have something to do with what really happened! but that doesn't really matter! because it failed to grab my attention! this movie bored the crap out of me! it lacks substance and style! the substance part could have been forgiven if the acting was any good and if the director tried to do something original! without the substance you at least have to bring some style or decent action! don't we need to be entertained? it would have helped if the director had seen more gangster movies! it is obvious that he didn't! otherwise he wouldn't have made this the way he did! this movie got a lot of publicity because of a little scandal surrounding klaas bruinsma and a member of the dutch royal family! this scandal has nothing to do with the movie what so ever! without it "de dominee" never would have been successful! i am sure of it!

this is the only movie that i can think of where after it ended, i was seething with anger at the waste of money and time on the part of myself and everyone involved in making it. no wonder alan moore refused to have anything to do with v for vendetta (a phenomenal film) after this debacle.it's not bad in an entertaining way, like showgirls. it's bad in a way that makes you want to claw your eyes out. plot holes the size of planets. the worst script in memory. horrible acting by decent actors. visuals that should be great, but somehow flop. it could have been so good...

25 august 2003 league of extraordinary gentlemen:sean connery is one of the all time greats and i have been a fan of his since the 1950's. i went to this movie because sean connery was the main actor. i had not read reviews or had any prior knowledge of the movie. the movie surprised me quite a bit. the scenery and sights were spectacular, but the plot was unreal to the point of being ridiculous. in my mind this was not one of his better movies it could be the worst. why he chose to be in this movie is a mystery. for me, going to this movie was a waste of my time. i will continue to go to his movies and add his movies to my video collection. but i can't see wasting money to put this movie in my collection

i will be honest and say i gave up on watching it somewhere mid-way and then fast forward with a few breaks. then i came back here and read many of the reviews already made....maybe is just me, and i can not help it, but this cartoon to north american society seems to have a purpose of "lets save them from themselves" and iraq comes to mind right away. it seems to me that this is a justification, or part of, for another invasion with "good intentions".the lady to me seems a self indulged person and i frankly got annoyed at her portrait of trying to raise pity and "feel" for her. well in this case this could never happen because, just like a history teacher has already mentioned here, i need to know how come her family was so wealthy above average, manage to keep that ( were they playing both sides maybe?)and send her to paris!? now, if this would have been made after a poor girl's biography i could see myself having certain emotions. but as it stands + its release timing this is just pure propaganda movie; even worse, since its cartoon, it overplays the "soft" side of tings too well for its own good , in order to possibly be taken serious.besides there are those clichés regarding gays. well, a woman that fights toward winning her rights should not have at least some compassion for the underdogs of society just like her??? the message is obviously self indulgent from the view of a ruling class member.i only give it 2 stars because its production and related stuff. a propaganda movie obviously has interests in convincing-manipulating my thoughts and therefore generally is well done appealing to certain visual emotions that i can not deny i might have as well.

the only good thing about persepolis is the shadows created in the german expressionism-style of animation and a hint of history. this movie bored me. it was about a woman dissatisfied with her culture who tries everything else and then goes back to her roots. here she finds great discontentment once again and finally leaves for final to let everyone else in her country figure out the situation and what they will do now that she is not there to support them. it comes to no conclusion and leaves us with a feeling that this woman has no loyalties. mind you, she is torn between cultures and doesn't have enough of a background it seems to figure what is important and real. she is listening to ever-so-many voices and will most likely end up a world citizen of some kind than one with any ties to her native culture of iran. the only thing i received from this movie was angst.

although allegedly autobiographical, this movie demonstrates very little insight both into the protagonist's psychology (resulting in a flat, fragmented characterization) as well as into larger-scale historical processes, and my hope of either learning something new or improving my understanding of contemporary iran remained unfulfilled. instead, i found my sensibilities somewhat dulled as a succession of bearded islamic villains replaced each other taunting, torturing or killing the wantonly victimized prototypical middle-class iranian whose western cultural sympathies were patent (and whose exoneration the movie quite blatantly seeks.) the deeper understanding the movie does seem to demonstrate is that of the mass-media market, as it serves to nourish prevalent occidental folk-ideologies (i.e. a "crowd pleaser"). what redeemed the movie from being outright boring was its creative animation - genuinely minimalistic imagery which, nevertheless, always kept the screen rich, expressive and unambiguous - no small fete for which i do give it some stars.

it starts quite good, but after a while you start to expect more from this film than you are actually getting. everything becomes unclear and unclear it stays. czech filmmakers were good 20 or more years ago. but after they transfered to capitalistic country, here it is, czech unofficial but well known mentality ... copying ... copying ... copying of everything they consider good, when they see it in another movies or countries or elsewhere. i think that this is a good example of making "art" and "politics" and "horror" and "humor" and "film" and money. and it remains me of the /one flew over the cuckoo's nest/, which can not be compared to this film in the way of art and actors and story and politics. i think this film is boring. it could be done better. at least, they tried. sorry guys. :-( canot not recommend

when jan svankmajer lets his imagination run wild, get ready. you're in for dark, harrowing films like "alice" and "little otik," or short gems such as "down to the cellar" and "jabberwocky." all of those are excellent films that represent disturbing, surrealistic film-making at its best.on the other hand, when svankmajer attempts to make a political statement of any kind, you're advised to leave the room in a hurry. svankmajer's films in this vein tend to be both adolescent and preachy, presenting straw-man caricatures in repetitious fashion to express his pseudo-brilliant insights."lunacy," unfortunately, is very much this latter type of movie. cartoonish ideas and characters are stretched paper-thin for an appalling two hours. there are a few moments that briefly hold interest, but these few oases are separated by vast deserts of boredom.if you found svankmajer's dreadful, monotonous short film "et cetera" brilliant and hilarious, you'll probably love "lunacy." if you've never seen a svankmajer film before, please start elsewhere.

talk about creepy. if you really want to sit down and watch this episode where the girl who was in firefly later on gets kidnapped there's entertainment for you, but only if you like this sort of thing. i don't so i thought, to be frank, this episode was appalling. thankfully it's one of a few duff episodes in season 3, and the only charles grant craig episode, so you don't get much of this sort of thing in season 3. so, overall verdict? just read the summary at the top. this is a strong contender (hell money says hi!) for worst episode of season 3. to be honest though, i hadn't really expected much. i wish i could oubliette this episode altogether. that's one thing they got right: the title.

thank god you're here is painful, positively painful. the title is apt, in a sense, if aimed at the large studio audience paid to laugh like they were watching the second coming of the marx brothers. and trust me, they are paid.as creatively barren as the entertainment industry has become, i refuse to believe that nbc brass really have faith in this turkey. rather, i think thank god you're here is what all of you get who didn't watch, or didn't appreciate studio 60, which previously graced the peacock network's monday night lineup. you want to turn your nose up at caviar, fine. here's some lovely alpo direct from menu foods for you to slop around in.

this show is terrible. i cannot get over the complete waste of great talent this show contains. this is not entertaining improvisational acting, it's just a cheap attempt to throw someone famous comedic actors onto a stage and have them perform a poorly improved scene. i have actually done improv work as an actor, and this show is not improv.what the audience is actually laughing at (if they're actually laughing at this show at all, it looks quite fake) is the embarrassment of the guest star being lost like a deer in headlights. the dumb, completely unrelated things they come up with are what people laugh at. and if it's not part of the scene, the actors will tell them that it's wrong! i find this show is disgrace to the art, and makes me cry for shows like whose line is it anyway, which had great talent, great improv games, and on top of everything else, didn't make me want to change the channel.

with nbc's "thank god you're here", the network may be trying to replicate the successes of abc's improv sitcom, "who's line is it anyway?" in which host drew carey would judge the performances of a handful of cast regulars asked to improvise scenes of some kind. in the nbc show, dave foley and co-host dave alan grier oversee a handful of notable comedians who must improvise their way through various scenes which all begin with "thank god you're here." it takes itself far too seriously (why must viewers be repeatedly reminded that the actors have never seen the sets before), both co-hosts seem less then enthused. after watching the continuously sub-par, unfunny attempts by the actors to solicit some laughs, i am left wondering whether the live audience is genuinely laughing at what transpires, or whether they, too, are improvising. expect this time slot filler to be a very short-lived one.

on the positive, i'll say it's pretty enough to be watchable. on the negative, it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen. long, whiny and pointless. and i'm not saying this to be mean, i really wanted to like this film, it seemed to have everything going for it, had the so called "buzz", and was a hassle to track down besides. had a little more effort gone into it on the story side, i believe this would've been amazing. and i expect the team behind it will produce wonderful work in the future, they clearly have the ability. but i recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go.

this is the worst movie that i have ever seen. at first i thought that it was going to be good because i'm interested in the bermuda triangle, but instead it was terrible. all it did was offer a bunch of lame explinations that didn't make sense (if time moves differently there how come the woman didn't age, and her son aged rapidly), and have a horrible sappy ending. next time the guys who made this go to bermuda they should take all copies of this movie with them. please everyone vote for this movie so it can get on the worst movie list.

the bermuda triangle ,we are told in this waste of celluloid, is the portal to another time and dimension and can be crossed using cheap special effects by bad actors spouting inane dialoguei simply was unable to decide who the makers of this excresence thought would be its target audience as it seems impossible anybody could derive even a modicum of pleasure from the outcome avoid-its not even bad enough to be good.

got to confess right up front that i didn't watch this entire movie. i missed the first hour during a sci fi channel broadcast. or was i spared the first hour? the other reviewers sum this one up nicely. it was badly conceived. badly scripted. badly acted.but the worst thing for me was the adr. the entire film, which appeared to have been dubbed, sounded like it was done in somebody's garage. there was a voluminous echo to the words, which just served to make the bad dialog hang. and hang. and hang. even a made for tv movie should have recognized this.and the idea that alternate dimensions are differentiated by color saturation went out in the 80s, folks.

if you feel like wasting 86 minutes on a film that makes no sense, is badly written ,with a bad plot and bad acting then this little gem is for you. recommended for those who are about to fall asleep. major annoyance will be felt by the awake viewer. do not pay to see this movie!

if you're a north american 'tourist' looking for a 'trap' here it is. was this "trading spaces visits tuscany?" there were way too many stereotypes. little attention was given to character and plot development. yawn. highlight of the film: the flag throwing. poor guy! i thought he was going to loose an eye!

this is just another one of those "american finds romance with charming foreigner in exotic european locale." this genre has been cinematically bankrupt since the 1950s, yet they continue to churn them out. i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this - bad idea, we both hated it. if all you want to see is tuscany, try watching "stealing beauty" with liv tyler - a marginally better movie.this types of genre movies are very hallmark greeting card-ish.

this movie was thoroughly unwholesome, unsettling and unsatisfying. apart from a few nice shots of italy, there's nothing to recommend this movie. as usual, hollywood draws the wrong conclusion from a fractured existence--the _next_ guy you meet, whom you sleep with after knowing for a few hours, _he_ must be mr. right. as for humor, there is some in the movie, but i can't see how anyone could possibly label this a romantic _comedy_ since about three-quarters of the movie is totally depressing! my recommendation? skip it in the theaters, wait till it comes out on dvd, then skip it there also. i want someone to give me back the two hours i wasted watching this dreck, drivel, dross.

this movie was supposedly based on a non-fiction book. i'm not sure what book the script writer(s) read to write their adaptation but it has absolutely nothing to do with the true life adventures of frances mayes in italy. instead, it is an uninteresting tale that takes liberties at every juncture to bash men. note the following examples:********************************************************************spoiler details********************************************************************bash number one : lane's husband cheats on her and her marriage ends in a divorce.bash number two : lane ventures into a local italian town and is promptly solicited by every male on the street.bash number three : lane is saved from the horny town folk men by a charming gentlemen. she falls for him after consummating an afternoon of love making. she later finds out that he's already attached and cheating with her.bash number four : you have to broaden your horizon for this one because the reference is definitely is in the movie. her lesbian couple friends decide to have a baby by invetro (sp?) fertilization. i am told that in most lesbian relationships, you have one person assuming the female role and another assuming the male role. in the movie, after the female has been made pregnant, the "male" lesbian decides to run out on the relationship because she can not handle it.in conclusion, this movie has nothing to do with the book that it was supposedly based on.

the movie had no excitement and does not have anything to hold your interest. the movie had nothing exiting,funny,dramatic or romantic about it!!! how can a movie be romantic if the girl never gets a the right guy until the last seen in the movie, than the movie ends??? maybe part ii will be romantic, but somebody else will have to risk wasting their money! i have nothing else to say other than do not waste your time!!! the movie had nothing exiting,funny,dramatic or romantic about it!!! the movie had nothing exiting,funny,dramatic or romantic about it!!! the movie had nothing exiting,funny,dramatic or romantic about it!!! the movie had nothing exiting,funny,dramatic or romantic about it!!!

diane lane is beautiful and sexy, and tuscany is gorgeous but this film is no better than mediocre and that's being generous. the story line is grafted onto a travelogue and remains thoroughly uninvolving.set in (let's say) a suburb of newark, the plot would be deemed ridiculous. all that saves the movie are the tuscan countryside and occasional scenes set in florence and positano, and a film of the while-the-sun-sinks-slowly-in-the-west variety would have served better to show what it certainly one of the loveliest locales in all the world.

an anonymous film which could have been directed by anyone at all.where is anthony mann,the director of such classics as "el cid" " the naked spur" or "the man from laramie"?there are marvelous shots of planes in the clouds,lovingly filmed.the story is very trite ,and almost completely devoid of dramatization.the couple lives an almost routine life and the user who complains about june allyson's choice for the wife ,imho,totally misses the point.with her less-than-attractive look,her hoarse voice,she was the perfect housewife the screenplay needed.at the time,women were barefoot and pregnant:there 's not one single woman among the base staff,even in the desk jobs -.all they had to do was worrying about their hubbies ,who were fighting for democracy and against an enemy whose name we never hear ,but in 1955,it was not hard to guess it.one wonders why a young person who has never seen a mann movie should choose this one among all the great movies he made.

this film reeks of production line planning. it appears like the filmmakers looked at recent hit movies, and threw spaghetti on the screen - jimmy stewart! june allyson! anthony mann! baseball! war! baby! airplane! - roll 'em! - the film does address the age of the stewart/allyson performers; though, i'm certain we are still supposed to think they are much younger.there are messages in "strategic air command" i found curiously shocking and offensive, but i'll stick with one truly wretched element: the happily married couple is challenged when mr. stewart's character makes an important decision without consulting his wife. in the film's most dramatic scene, she calls him on it. it ends completely unresolved - allyson is crying her heart out on their bed, and stewart walks out on her. no discussion; he simply says he is correct, and walks out on his devastated wife. for all he knows, she could slit her wrists.later, allyson apologizes for questioning her husband's decision.unbelievable! stick with stewart-allyson in "the stratton story" (1949). ** strategic air command (3/25/55) anthony mann ~ james stewart, june allyson, frank lovejoy

if good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made. the film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care. it is about patriotism and about patriotism in a healthy way.not quite ten years after the film, i knew air force officers who taught my r.o.t.c. classes at university. they were intellectuals. they thought deeply about their work. they has senses of humor. one had been a crew member on the first plane to drop a hydrogen bomb. i have wondered if any one of them died in vietnam. i imagine that they flew missions there.regrettably, the film fails. the movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative. no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie. her susan holland is a woman that one would flee, not embrace. col. james stewart (who as then a colonel) makes a good stab at this role as lt. col(and later col.) dutch holland. but the most interesting thing he does in the role is bite into a sandwich. i'm not kidding. stewart was good as biting in sandwiches as he did in the spirit of saint louis. one might think of ted williams, but i don't when i watch mr. steward in the role. i do think of william holden as lt. harry brubaker in the bridges at toko-ri . the comparison is not good for mr. stewart, who seems wasted in this film.footage shot from a b-36 looks like outtakes from commercials for an airline. though beautiful, the aerial shots are mundane. for the time, they might have impressed viewers. the crash in greenland involves unexciting modeling you expect the outcome to be good.the undertone--the subtext-- for the film voices the tedium that air force flight crews must have felt during their long missions and the banality that the air force used to make its business--well business like any other business. one imagines how a la nouvelle vague director might explore this theme and then one begins to think about how someone with imagination might have filmed this movie. little moments are missed.when crews returned from long missions, the members of the crew got a shot of scotch and a massage before debriefing the mission. showing that might have helped.banality was the image the air force wanted and mr. mann accommodated the brass. maybe, in that sense, the film works, but not for me.i mourn when i watch the movie, because i think all of us, director, actors, crew, viewers, and members of the armed services might have enjoyed giving and getting much more than we get here.i don't think that this movie had to be dr. strangelove or 2001, both of which it presages, but it had potential never realized. yet, i enjoy watching it. i think of the airmen on their long missions and the ground crews in isolated places. there is a certain sense of honor celebrated here and i celebrate that honor. i certainly understand why people who praise this movie here and other places appreciate it. if there were no intentional fallacy, it would get a 10 from me..

it may be, although there are still two or three i've missed. this film constructs an interesting nocturnal cityscape, reminiscent of so many foggy scenes from sherlock holmes movies, and populates it with sinister, kafka-esque characters. into their midst, the movie drops mia farrow, who sounds like she's still playing hannah, and woody allen, who seems to be reprising his nebbish role from play it again sam. are we supposed to laugh at his stammering and hand-wringing? i suppose i would, if the rest of the movie were clearly a comedy, but it's not. at least i don't think it is.

"shadows and fog" is surely one of woody allen's weakest films, right up there with "september" and "hollywood ending" (though nothing allen has done equals the awfulness of "anything else")."shadows and fog" is allen's homage to the german expressionist style of film-making, all stark and stylized light and shadow and...you guessed it.....lots of fog. but you can tell allen got caught up in the technique and the parody and forgot to make a movie that anyone would care about.luckily, he made "husbands and wives" the same year, so things weren't a total wash for him.grade: d

a wonderful semi-humorous homage to expressionistic black and white films of folks like fw murnau, fritz lang, carl dreyer, marcel carné and others. allen plays a character caught in a kafkaesque nightmare, at first thinking he is part of a vigilante group trying to catch a killer and slowly realizing that he might be a suspect. the writing is a little forced (this is, after all, woody allen trying to be a coy kafka), but the point is made, and no harm done. the cinematography is interesting, about 100 shades of gray, but make sure you watch in a very dark room with a good screen, or details will get swallowed in the fog. this is an amusing little movie with a few laughs that are actually snorts of "uh-huh". the acting is fine, considering the odd vehicle, and it's worth watching if you are big woody allen fan. also of interest to those knowledgeable about expressionistic films. i'd give this a 6.5 out of 10.

meet cosmo (jason priestley), a nerdy young bookie content with his boring life crunching numbers for the mob and living in a stark basement apartment at a senior citizens center. his only recreation is watching tv and the occasional tryst with his quirky prostitute pal, honey (janeane garofalo). but one day all this changes, when the mob boss is killed and the well-regarded cosmo is selected by the smooth and persuasive new chief, gordon (robert loggia), to become a full-fledged hit man. it's an offer the reluctant cosmo cannot-repeat, cannot-refuse, and he quickly trades in his mundane, solitary existence for a crash course in revenge under the tutelage of veteran mobster steve (peter riegert), a relaxed, suburban bon vivant who relishes the job's maximum pay and minimum hours. in no time, cosmo surprises both himself and mentor steve by displaying an absolutely uncanny aptitude for the work. though he's never touched a gun before, cosmo proves to be both a crack marksman and, after an initial wave of moral hesitancy, a cool, detached killer. soon, cosmo is dispatching deadbeat clients with speed and style and his natural flair with a gun quickly establishes him as an invaluable addition to gordon's mob.reality gets in the way though, when one night, while being massaged by honey, cosmo admits feeling a bit uptight and she recommends he try yoga to relax. cosmo takes her advice and joins a nearby yoga class taught by a beautiful young woman named jasmine (kimberly williams). cosmo is instantly taken with the kind and gentle jasmine, who soon becomes drawn to cosmo. now if she can just get rid of her pesky, abusive boyfriend, randy (josh charles), maybe she and cosmo can actually start something. cosmo, using some of the "skills" of his new trade, eventually persuades randy to disappear and his relationship with jasmine takes off.writer/director m. wallace wolodarksy, a two-time emmy award-winner for his work on "the tracy ullman show" and "the simpsons", has fashioned a script fusing his three genre loves: "i like comedies, gangster movies and romances," explained wolodarsky, "so i essentially smashed together all three to create this film." but what he's come up with is a film so disjointed and improbable that it looks just like a very long sketch on saturday night live. it's monotonous tone doesn't so much match it's droll sense of humor, as underline the fact that a lot of money was spent on a vehicle for jason priestly to blithely shatter his nice guy image, which doesn't even fully succeed because he plays his character not as a nerd, but as a laconic zombie. a nerd may be naive, but a nerd has passion. passion for inwardly directed things. but priestly plays his character as mentally deficient, almost the anti-forrest gump. unfortunately, "coldblooded" doesn't have the sense of scope to actually be the anti-forrest gump.peter riegert (local hero, animal house) turns in a fine performance as usual, and kimberly williams does her best with what she has to work with, but janeane garofalo (hbo's larry sanders show) is practically wasted in her role as cosmo's friend. probably not for long, though. garofalo has all the enthusiasm and charm of an apple waiting to be picked and it's just a matter of time before she'll be given a meaty role, hopefully doing a tag team thing with marisa tomei.

can there be a worst film? even ed wood at his horrific worst couldn't come up with something this bad. cheesy, stupid, long-winded, preposterous...and those are the good points. i saw this trash back in the early 80's when i was incredibly bored to begin with, and actually sat through the entire thing without blowing my brains out, although that probably would have been a more pleasant experience. i actually remembered it because it was so bad. it makes me sad in a way because some of the best directors got their start by making tv movies (ie spielberg) and it was a wonderful way for them to get their initial material before the public, but crap like this just totally killed the entire process.

it is easy to tell early in this movie exactly what will happen, and who will die. it is about 4 women and a man who on a vacation. this was made during the end of the ultra nazi seventies, when blonde women were supposedly ultra american survivors and brunettes were all deserving of death.this movie, like the others of that era, contrives to bring this about, and the viewer knows this. there is no mystery or suspense. the people squabble, but everything is so predictable for the prejudices of the time, it is laughable.the five people happen upon two savage young characters, and go nuts. everyone is nuts, so that the director-writer team can justify their nazi propaganda.for some reason, the guy is attracted to the blonde, who is really not much to look at, and ignores a super hot looking brunette that any heterosexual man would go nuts over. one must remember that in the seventies, movies were meant to appeal to women and not men.totally crap and totally depressing.

you'll feel like you've experienced a vacation in hell after you have sat down and watched this horrible tv movie. this movie is an exercise in over-acting (very bad over-acting) to situations that made out to be more than what they are. i won't give away the plot, but once you realize why the people in this film are running from the native man in the film you will demand the two wasted hours of your life back. the only plus is seeing marcia brady running around in a bikini!

this has to rate as one of the cheesiest of tv shows in a long time.jose ferrer played the title character, nemo. he did the part justice and certainly looked the part. but nowadays, it strikes me that the nemo he was made up to be bore more than a passing resemblance to captain bird's eye, from the tv commercials. or maybe it's the other way around.his nemesis, professor cunningham, was overacted brilliantly by burgess meredith. he never seemed to get over his "penguin" days from batman. although he doesn't do his penguin "quack" here, he is without parallel as the maniacal professor. only john colicos, of battlestar galactica fame, chewed up the scenery better as a maniacal despot.i never can recall what the grudge was between nemo and cunningham, but it must have been severe, since the prof. never missed a chance to try and scupper nemo, and vice-versa.the effects were nothing special, though prof. cunningham's submarine was way better looking than nemo's. it also had a crew of strange, fish-like amphibians that served cunningham and did his every bidding.however, the most memorable aspect of the whole show was prof. cunningham's secret weapon. the delta beam! he was forever saying "fire delta beam!", whereupon, a fishy crewman would horribly overract the motion of firing the weapon by use of a full shoulder shrug. truly priceless! they don't make them like this anymore, and perhaps just as well. but like other series of this era, for those who remember it, it will always have an affectionate, if cheddar-covered, place in our hearts.

i know this film was shown on local tv when i was a kid, but i can't remember whether i watched it or not; seeing it now, considering how utterly forgettable it is, i still don't know  so i counted it as a first viewing! there have been several films featuring the title character, a creation of visionary french author jules verne; these include: 20,000 leagues under the sea (1954; with james mason in the role), master of the world (1961; vincent price), mysterious island (1961; herbert lom), captain nemo and the underwater city (1969; robert ryan) and the mysterious island of captain nemo (1973; omar sharif).this version stars academy award winner jose' ferrer. however, even if the premise itself isn't half-bad  awakened from suspended animation in his submarine, "the nautilus", and finding himself in modern times, nemo adopts all his ingenuity to aid the u.s. navy in defeating megalomaniac scientist burgess meredith  it emerges as easily his most infantile adventure yet! for instance: five seconds into the film, meredith's assistant  donning a steel mask  rants that "the world shall be ours!"); equally hilarious are the zealous gesticulations of the similarly decked-out midget, whose task it is to fire the professor's all-important "delta beam" - and how about those android-type minions aboard meredith's vessel who never seem to do much of anything?! ferrer manages to maintain his dignity throughout, but meredith is an embarrassment (in what is virtually a retread of his penguin characterization from the 1960s batman tv series and film) where the budget was so tight  mostly invested in bland production design and shoddy special effects, no doubt, and both evidently influenced by star wars (1977)  that, apparently, they couldn't even afford him a decent costume (he looks positively idiotic wearing a tie in a sub)! the supporting cast includes mel ferrer (playing a saboteur in the vein of joan fontaine from another irwin allen production, voyage to the bottom of the sea [1961], and who engages in a swashbuckling routine with his namesake inside the engine-room of "the nautilus"), lynda day george (unsurprisingly, she's the only female character around) and horst buchholz (as the king of atlantis  for whatever reason, nemo is obsessed with locating the famed lost continent).by the way, having been reduced from a three-part mini-series for theatrical exhibition, the film obviously feels choppy  though one is still able to discern where one episode ended and another began.

this film was utterly horrible. stupid premise, and horrible acting by all. whoever wrote this trash should be hanged. reminds me of a hack student film, but worse. who ever produced this should give up now. i know opinions are subjective and all, and some may think this "fantastic" as some think "dune (1984)" was fantastic, well get off your horse and watch some real films. ok, the acting was tolerable, and with better direction could have been far better, but it didn't so it suffers. i don't know how much more i can say about this waste of film, other than to totally trash it. anyways it was horrible and i recommend to avoid it like the plague, if you come anywhere near "dreamland", rent the movie beside it instead.

...i can't believe there are actually people here who recommend this movie... this is such a slow pos going absolutely nowhere. oh yeah ok it goes somewhere, but you see that coming from miles away. acting: really really bad, maybe the bartender was kind of ok. editing: bad! i suppose the editor was told "we need at least 90 minutes", cause half of all the scenes could have gone in the bin. music: don't get me started on that, the lousiest score i've ever heard. who is that singing in the last scene for crying out loud?? directing: oh my, imnsho david lynch sucks, but someone trying to copy him sucks even harder. skip this one.

this film has absolutely no redeeming features. it's not even worthy of being in the 'so bad it's good' category - it's simply bad. badly acted, badly shot, badly written, badly directed, terrible sound recording and the whole thing is just incredibly amateur. quite how this got a release is beyond me.oh, and could someone please tell the lead actress that if you're playing 'mad' that does not mean that you should constantly fiddle with your hair - in a film that was generally irritating, this was probably one of the most irritating things of all.on the plus side, i think this is the only film ever to feature a nazi carjacker ...

i cannot believe anyone is giving this film a good rating. in addition to the terrible acting, thin (nonexistent?) plot line and slooooooooow pace, this would be the movie to watch if you were really trying to fall asleep. the writer's and director's brains must have been fried eggs to ever have concocted something as abominable as this. based on the plot summary on the dvd case, the premise really sounded promising. but within the first ten minutes i knew it was a lost cause. if you want to see a really creep take on the area 51 idea, check out the remake of "the hills have eyes". dreamland will soon fade away as all pathetic films of its ilk do. next!!!

maybe james p. lay knows what do to in the sound department if a director supervises him.in 'dreamland (2007)' however, he cannot accomplish anything as a writer or as a director.there is absolutely nothing in this film, no story, no character building, no events, no atmosphere, no plot, no twists, no acting that deserves that name.in any of those departments this movie is billions of light years behind any short film that has some actual thinking in it, even a one minute one.it has nothing to do with any of david lynch's works!i actually think it could be used as mental torture or as negative propaganda material against the west.recommend it only to your worst enemies!

ed wood, perhaps the worst film maker of all time left us gems that are so bad, they delight, being unintentionally funny and therefore charming and innocent.james lay, and his financial backers (mom and dad, it seems from the credits) have created in 'dreamland' a film just as poorly made as any ed wood film, but lacking any charm or innocence. dreamland simply stinks, and about the only good thing about this 90 minute waste of time is the certain knowledge that james lay and his fellow perps will never make another picture again.i must mention some of the dramatic lengths some of the crew took to avoid being associated with this horrible picture. i'm sure the production controller, once seeing the completed film, demanded to have his or her name changed in the credits to 'donna snartlebutt' and the accounting done by 'brutus'. one can imagine 'brutus' with his roll of 5 dollar bills paying the crew at the end of a shooting day.i wont mention the many technical problems with this pathetic little videotape, but i must mention a few commentaries that compare this slag to the work of david lynch. you know you have turned out a real stinker when you have your mom log into imdb and post such astonishing bs - no one , save violent mental patients, could -ever- mistake 'dreamland' with -anything- produced by lynch. what a horrific slight against mr. lynch and his work.go back to film school, mr lay.

i have to say this is the worst movie that i have ever watched in my life, i cannot believe that i wasted $10 at blockbuster ; this movie should be burned and who ever thought of it has issues. who ever actually spent money to make this movie was insane =d this movie has terrible actors and some of the scenes make absolutely no sense. well, the whole movie doesn't make sense. also the part where those "men" come into the diner ( department of national securities )that happened to be the worst part of the film. how dare they say frank sinatra's name in vain? also, what is up with those glasses? when the guy and girl are in the car and she "drinks" water, you can totally tell that she isn't even drinking! also, what is up with the freaky dinner guy. and everyone knows that you don't stab tires, you slash them.

i never comment on a film, but i have to say that this was one of the worst films that i have ever seen. i feel it was made by a beginner film student and not to put down talented film students, but this was horrible! i did not buy the lead actress and felt i was in acting class with her while she was on film. her decisions were very safe and i feel she was mimicking other actresses in films and not acting and making her own decisions. the direction was very confusing and the sound was louder than the actors themselves. the end may have made a little more sense if there was someone narrating the events and not a song. i love patsy cline but she her songs appear quite frequently in films. maybe the song selection could have been a little more original. the song "crazy" was such a cliché. as i said before i never comment on films and have seen my share of good and bad, but this was the worst. sorry.

the lives of megan(jackie kresler)and dylan(shane elliott)change in the nevada desert between reno and las vegas. they stop to eat at a small greasy spoon where they reluctantly learn about the infamous area 51 by the café proprietor(jonathan breck). after getting back on the road in their forty year old lincoln, the radio gets a little crazy broadcasting hitler's speech at the 1836 olympics and then later a 1958 news bulletin of elvis presley being drafted into the military. the car slowly breaks down and the two are in for the scare of their lives as mysterious unexplainable things happen in the lonely radiation-poisoned desert; remnants of nuclear testing. megan meets a lost little girl(channing nichols)and a wounded wwii soldier. the nightmarish journey doesn't end there. kresler is impressive to a degree and writer/director james lay makes good use of patsy cline tunes. all in all, moderately interesting sci-fi.

i watch a ton of movies and enjoy the occasional b movie but this movie was awful. aside from the "homemade" quality of the film it was very slow and seemed to make no point. i'm only commenting b/c of another comment i saw here that said it was great! wow! maybe ok to watch on a rainy day when nothing else is available.the characters were disjointed and didn't fit any discernible pattern of reality. the dialog between characters was forced and at times very confusing.i guess if you were very into the whole area 51 and understood some of the nuances other comments reference, it may be good - but for me - the average joe - i don't get it!?

i watched this because of the description and cover art and yet again was deceived.i am getting sick of all these new stupid straight to dvd horror movies.once in a blue moon 1 will be ok. it started out with a confusing scene and then jumped 30 years and showed a couple one night during a thunderstorm which was ok because i like storms and it set a nice mood.then it turned into a cool road trip where they ended up at a diner encountering bizarre people.the rest got weird and then got confusing.i did watch it til the end but was even more confused when it ended so badly.i had higher hopes for this movie but it was more like a science fiction then horror and something that should have been made for tv.

dreamland started out moderately interesting but never went anywhere except tedium city. a low rent affair with no name actors and laughable effects, not recommended for any reason. the best thing that could be said is it looks like they really filmed it on location in the nevada desert. that's it, i can't think of one thing good besides that about this stinker. the finale is supposed to be some kind of revelation but falls flat like the rest. oh, i thought of one other good point about this cheese, it clocks in at just over an hour although it still wears out its welcome long before then. when the girl starts walking around in the desert at night it seems to last forever and just keeps getting worse from there. the attempts at horror aren't effective in the least. the story is an attempt at a twilight zone style feel but fails badly. check out "retroactive" for a good science fiction b-movie.

this is seriously the worst movie i have ever seen, right from the start the movie goes straight down hill with its cheesy music score, poor acting, and total lack or real story or plot. even for a b movie this is down right awful. after reading some of the good reviews i thought i'd keep an open mind and watch it. but all the bad reviews were so right. i totally can't understand how anyone could have enjoyed it. i'm a huge sci-fi fan and this was way more than i could swallow. definlty do yourself a favor a move on to a different movie. they are many other better movies that deal with this subject matter. you have been warned.

a really terrible movie, really low-budget, with terrible acting, a convoluted and inane plot, a modest reworking of the vampire tales mixed with modern science.the result is a total mess, without meaning for most parts, with very limited and cheap effects. it is not even fun, like several of the low budget independent movies of this kinda waste of time

a friend of mine loves tacky horror films so i often get to see low budget stuff like this. this is, however the first time i have been compelled to write a review of one...put simply this is probably the worst film i have ever seen! even worse then boggy creek ii!the entire budget for the film seems to have been spent on a brief scene in the middle when dr. klaus stands in this chamber thing & turns all vampire-ish.the only good thing to say about it is that it was hilarious after a few beers (but for all the wrong reasons).

how poor is this movie? well, i got it less than two months ago and can hardly remember what it was about...i also paid a £1 for this on dvd, the old story of 'put-a-new-cover-on-the-box-and-some-fool-will-buy-it' syndrome. all i really recall it that the cast ran around a lot, use of cars must have been too above the budget and that a vampire was involved. then again, guess you could know that from the film's title.straight to video rubbish or straight to cheap-jack dvd as it is now. this stuff will be in the bargain bins at rental shops, supermarkets and charity shops until the death of the sun. only cockroaches will rule the earth but this trash will still be around. god bless the dawn of the dvd age....

bought for £1, project vampire is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. wooden acting,lame effects and a terrible storyline all add up to be a movie you have no reason to even want to see. pv is one of those movies that don't even have the good grace to be bad in an enjoyable way, instead this bile seems to try to make itself as offensively dull,stupid and crap as humanly possible.a vampire has created a serum he sells to old people as a life-enhancer, and those who take it fall under his control. a former lab intern teams up with a nurse to try and stop him. someone should have stopped the makers of this rubbish.no one has any reason to see this movie, and i am actually appalled at the human race on the grounds that at time of writing 2 people have given this atrocity 10 out of 10.

ouch!! what a mess we have here. not so much of a mess as a painfully dull, half-assed excuse for exploitation. brought to you by the one and only, j. g. "pat" patterson, yeah, the same one from moonshine mountain. doctor gore, formerly known as the body shop, is, i guess, somewhat inspired by frankenstein, and god knows what else. the late mr. patterson also stars in this joke, as a heartbroken scientist/plastic surgeon, who has recently lost his wife in a car accident, and is driven insane from grief, to the point that it becomes clear that the next step is to slaughter countless females, then maybe rob a few graves for body parts, in order to "put together" the perfect mate. it won't be easy, but thank goodness his pal gregg the hunchback is available to lend a hand, and to offer moral support.if proof was ever needed that some peoples goals are not meant to be accomplished, here it is, gang. this patterson hayseed obviously never had any business directing anything, much less, following in the footsteps of good ol' h. g. as a master of gore. i've never seen a gore movie that just flat-out refuses to give the viewer a single reason to keep watching. even the gore is boring. almost remotely humorous at times, but impossible to tell whether it's intentional or not. i pick "not".shot in charolotte, north carolina (home of the california axe massacre), on, most likely, a 3-digit budget, by a guy, as untalented as he may have been, who probably had an appreciation for drive-in trash, so, maybe we should give good ol' j. g. a break, i mean, he tried (i assume) which is more that can be said for most, and this movie is better than any of the big-budget super-hero garbage the theaters put out these days, although, i realize that isn't saying much. besides, doctor gore is quite the improvement over patterson's previous failure, the electic chair, so it's slightly possible he would have improved his craft in time, had he not died, so maybe it's not all that terrible, especially compared to the other movie on the dvd, how to make a doll, so what the hell, check it out. 4/10

douglas sirk's inaugural "women's-picture" weepy for universal, based on a preachy, dogmatic, didactic novel by the intolerable lloyd c. douglas (author of that other beloved piece of crap, *the robe*). rock hudson, in the role that catapulted him to stardom, plays bob merrick, a drunken playboy worth untold millions who is more interested in chasing skirts and racing speedboats than in finishing his medical degree. in the first scene, he wrecks his boat on a sumptuously photographed lake. the accident nearly kills merrick, and thus he requires a rather mysterious "resuscitator machine" to keep him alive . . . meanwhile, across town, beloved surgeon dr. phillips finally drops dead from a heart condition. since the local hospital can maintain only one resuscitator at a time, phillips dies so that the louse may live. when merrick learns of this, he tries to make apologetic overtures to phillips' family, especially to the widow (jane wyman, coiffed and clothed in matronly hauteur), but indeed anyone and everyone who knew the surgeon spits at merrick like a brace of cobras. one doctor on the hospital staff even calls it "a total waste" that the playboy lived instead of the christ-like surgeon. hippocrates might have had something to say about that!these early scenes are where you'll find the typical sirkian iconoclasm: the director rubs our faces so much in the unpleasantness of middle-class, mid-century america, that one finds oneself rooting for the wastrel playboy to put whoopee-cushions under the ramrod fannies of these moral hypocrites. but, alas, no: the risible plot of the novel must proceed, and merrick soon finds himself getting converted by god, in the guise of pipe-puffing otto kruger, an artist who claims that phillips made him a better man and even a better painter. (why don't we see any of this amazing art?) we learn that the intolerably ubiquitous dr. phillips would often refuse payment for medical services rendered (though who exactly qualified for these "magnificent exemptions" is never made clear). this is supposed to provide our hero with a whole new outlook on life and an example of personal conduct. kruger even tries to make it all sound very illicitly exciting: "once you start this thing, there's no way out of it! it's an obsession . . . a magnificent obsession!" so merrick tries it out by again pestering the widow with apologetic overtures, but he somehow causes her to get hit by a car. she loses her eyesight. apparently, merrick will have several more stations-of-the-cross to trudge past before he can be accounted a decent fellow.but sirk continues to sneak in his revenges even as the movie grows more and more preachy. the most obvious bit has to be the presence of agnes moorehead as the head hospital nurse and wyman's friend and unrequited lesbian lover. note the disappointment on moorehead's face when merrick, finally redeemed as a doctor, shows up to save wyman's life near the end. hudson's own homosexuality, an open secret in hollywood at the time, is also used to great ironic effect. he and wyman -- dowdy and fifteen years older -- generate absolutely zero erotic heat in their scenes together, which, by the way, are purposefully few, presumably because any more scenes between the stars would hopelessly expose this whole enterprise. (one thing we feel certain of: if rock hudson was obsessed by anything, it certainly wasn't jane wyman.) it's a chronic case of *tea and sympathy*. sirk seemed to enjoy tweaking everyone's noses by having this gay actor -- who was attractive to the innocent ladies of the era -- coolly drift through these exquisitely-colored "women's pictures". in fact, the director worked with hudson 6 or 7 more times, to best effect in the follow-up to this film, *all that heaven allows*, which re-teamed hudson with wyman but was also accompanied by a realistic plot. in *obsession*, meanwhile, we must endure god/kruger gazing beneficently down from an observation-window onto merrick and his medical team as they prepare to save wyman's life, in tandem with a musical score of swelling vocals from a cheesy hollywood choir.but to see why sirk is considered an auteur, check out the scene wherein wyman explains to her grown daughter that she can in fact tell the difference from night and day. the entire frame is blackened, here: the daughter is barely visible, and wyman's face is faintly silhouetted against a faint light. she goes on to say that she hates the night because "i know that dawn will never come again". a great, chilling moment that deserves a much better movie than *magnificent obsession*.4 stars out of 10.

this movie is not very bad tjough. but one cannot find anything new about the personality of marquis de sade from this movie. the movie tries to stay on the borderline between erotic and insightful and it cannot succeed at either. the cinematography is really bad (straigh-to video quality)

the revisionist history -- making the evil marquis de sade a semi-heroic romantic -- is mind-boggling enough. but the atrocious acting, amateurish cinematography and terrible dubbing make this film achingly bad. the only reason to keep watching is that almost all the women in the film are gorgeous. and, amazingly, being tortured for days, with hands bound overhead, apparently doesn't detract from a woman's beauty, hairstyle and makeup. my guess is that the producers filmed mostly in russia, choosing women for their looks -- and willingness to work cheap -- rather than acting ability. if you decide to watch this because you have nothing better to do, or are a film student looking for bad examples, fast-forward through every scene not involving nudity.

i really don't know much about the marquis de sade, not having read any of his book, but i never imagined him as a flaming queen. carson kressley of queer eye for the straight guy, or jack from will and grace would have fit easily into the role that nick mancuso gave us.the movie itself was rather thin and seemed more of a parody - or an excuse to show the paris whorehouse several times with men and women having a good time on the couches in the parlor. what? they can't afford a room? i did find it cute that the madame (irina malysheva) felt she was doing her patriotic duty taking care of the soldier's needs.the movie was just an excuse to show a lot of breasts - and i mean a lot! fans of gimli (john rhys-davies) might be interested in seeing him in a different role as inspector marais.

i have never felt the need to add a review to this website until now, but having just sat through the film i felt it necessary to warn parents who may be thinking of showing it to their children. please don't! this is no disney film. this film tells us 'life is cruel' and if you show it to your children, in my opinion, you are too. the video box describes the film as a 'delight for all ages' and the imdb plot outline describes it as a 'family film'. i just had to find a definition of 'family film' and came across the following: "usually consisting of comedies or adventures, these films are often based on children's literature and can involve any number of helpful animals, friendly supernatural beings and fantasy worlds, all geared to stimulate and appeal to the imagination. whatever the situation, there is little or no offensive material and generally a lesson is learned on the way." not an apt description of tarka the otter, which contains some thoroughly unpleasant scenes, totally unsuitable for young children, and an ending that qualifies the film as a 'feel bad' movie. the lesson learned? as i said: life is cruel. family entertainment? i don't think so. unless you hate your family, that is. another review, more revealing than this but worth reading, can be found by following the 'external reviews' link.

i love ustinov's distinctive, literate narration. and the photography is quiet nice. we put the film on for our 3.5 year old who sort of wandered in and out of the room. so for our first viewing, we only saw about 1/3 of the movie and were quite charmed. when we re-watched, sitting down for family time,we were all mortified at the violence and life-threatening situations the poor otter got into. about halfway through the movie, there's a rack of dead, bloody furry animals. lots of blood, not just a little. then at the end, there's a wild struggle with a dog, then blood clouds the water. you'd think, given the g rating, that's all you'll see...that they will imply one of the animals died. nope. they drag the carcass out of the water and show it plainly for several traumatizing seconds. personally, as an adult i love horror movies and am fine with violent movies ala scorsese, cronenberg, tarantino. heck, i love the ultra violent battle royale. but those aren't kid movies and don't advertise themselves as such. if you are deliberately raising your young ones to see the harsh realities of life for cute animals, then this is the movie for you. if you are like me and my wife though, you might want to spare your child nightmares and avoid this one.

admittedly, the only reason i watched this film -- since it's been about a decade since it was released -- was because of ian holm; i was intrigued to see his portrayal of my second-favorite character in this play. at any rate, this film is as gritty as anything the old zeff has produced since "jesus of nazareth." but some of the best parts of the play have been left out. i understand the directing/editing choices, but i don't think that it really does justice to the play. perhaps i'm too much a purist. i would have to direct people (who have read this far) toward branagh's version, if it weren't that i despise his tendency toward over-dramatization. all the same, he plays a better hamlet than gibson. but then, weren't we all waiting for gibson to prove himself as an actor? now, all he's done is to prove that he wants to make films in extinct languages....perhaps the only shakespearean-worthy acting here is scofield as the ghost.

franco zeffirelli's ("the taming of the shrew," "romeo and juliet," "jesus of nazareth," "othello") third stab at transferring shakespeare to the screen works very well, with the casting of mel gibson ("mad max," "lethal weapon" and pre-"the passion of the christ" notoriety) in the role formerly owned by sir laurence olivier (and rightly so; see my review on his "hamlet," arguably the best interpretation of one of the bard's timeless (and most quoted) tragedies) and redone 5 years later by kenneth branagh as a full-bloodied treatment, explaining its 3 hour 22 minute running time, combined with a dream cast (and a lot of little additions, which were well-chosen and expertly done by the contemporary master of william shakespeare, kenneth branagh, the director of "henry v" and "dead again." joining the "lethal weapon" star are glenn close ("the big chill"), paul scofield ("a man for all seasons"), alan bates, ian holm, michael maloney (who would be cast as roderigo opposite kenneth branagh and laurence fishburne in oliver parker's "othello" (see my review of olivier's "stage" version of the tragedy, though he only starred in it) and who branagh would cast as laertes in his 3-hour version of "hamlet" (a proper homage to sir laurence olivier and his classic version of the play; see my review on that one as well) 5 years later), nathaniel parker (who would be cast as cassio in his brother's version of "othello" 4 years later) and helena bonham-carter, who would be cast in "mary shelley's frankenstein" 4 years later. zeffirelli intended this movie as a homage to sir laurence olivier (who had died 2 years prior to this movie) and it works pretty well, for the most part. what i was slightly uncomfortable with was zeffirelli's misplacing a lot of lines and in one scene, he gives one of hamlet's lines to the ghost. also, helena bonham-carter did not convince me as ophelia. she was too dull and unreal, whereas jean simmons (who had immortalized the role in olivier's version) and kate winslet (who did an acceptable job in kenneth branagh's uncut, epic revisionist reworking of "hamlet") were good in the role, with jean simmons being the best ophelia ever, that's why she was nominated for best actress in 1948 (she didn't win-what a shame). ian holm said his lines too quickly, not slowly as i expected him to, in a scene with him, laertes and ophelia. but then again, i'm more used to felix aylmer and richard briers' interpretations of the role and i think that they did better jobs than holm in their respective versions of "hamlet" (both done by great directors, actors, text-editors, producers and stars of all their versions of the bard's work) as polonius. the rest of the cast, however, was excellent. the scene where hamlet confronts his mother was very well done, but olivier and branagh heightened the scene to better lengths to create even more emotional intensity and suspense that the scene required. i recommend this version just to pass the time, but it's ideal as a teaching tool for 12th-grade english teachers (i recommend showing olivier's version first, then branagh's and finally this version). despite the film's "pg" rating, there was really nothing objectionable in the movie. only what the play called for. the best versions of "hamlet" are: #1 sir laurence olivier and kenneth branagh. both were so good that i can't decide which one was the best. see my reviews on these versions for more information. #2 franco zeffirelli. this one was alright. it started out alright with a scene not in the play, but should've then progressed to the actual beginning of the play, where a guard cries out "who's there?" "nay, answer me. stand and unfold yourself!!" that scene scares the hell out of you because you're sitting quietly and then-bam!!, you almost jump out of your skin. in short, that scene sets the tone for the rest of the play. huge blunder on zeffirelli's part to omit that scene. it also misplaced a lot of lines (and cut others that i think should've been put in), such as the line where hamlet says to ophelia "get thee to a nunnery, why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners?"; that line was supposed to have occurred in that scene, not where it was placed in the film (after the "to be or not to be" soliloquy. this version struggles between cutting out too much or too little from an excellent piece of literature. kenneth branagh would remedy that 5 years later with his uncut version of the tragedy, making his version a more fitting homage to sir laurence olivier, as several of the actors (aside from him) had performed "hamlet" on stage/or on film many times on different occasions. however, zeffirelli's take on "hamlet" is faithful to the play and that's what i was looking for. the setup for the final act duel was the same as in olivier and branagh's versions, only that the denouement in branagh's version was more violent than the denouement of the previous two faithful versions (more in line with the play; olivier toned it down...and it worked equally well) and stuck more closely to the play, with branagh throwing in a few harmless touches of his own...to very good effect. this version is not rated.

it is one of the joys of shakespeare that there can be no definitive performances - no single performance can be right', but some can be wrong, and this one is. there are at least two things about hamlet which cannot be dispensed with: 1. his indecisiveness and inability to take any kind of action. for god's sake that is what makes the play last as long as it does. if you had othello there instead of hamlet, claudius would be dead by the end of act one. any production has to try to explain why hamlet delays, why he is incapable of action. 2. his sexual disgust. his total revulsion at the thought of what his mother and uncle get up to in bed fill him with an utter disgust for all things sexual and this means that any kind of relationship with ophelia is impossible. at the slightest hint of sex, hamlet throws up. so, what does mel gibson give us? lusty action-man. you could not get further from the character of hamlet if you tried. there are lots of ways hamlet can be played, but this isn't one of them! what i don't understand is since they managed to get such good actors for the other parts - claudius, polonius and so on, why couldn't they find one to play hamlet as well. mark rylance in the part would have made this a great film. this mel gibson', whoever he is, completely let down the rest of the cast. and lets face it, hamlet without the prince really doesn't work.

well, to each his own, but i thought gibson's hamlet was the most god-awful rendition i had ever witnessed... as subtly nuanced as a paper bag, and as inspired as a telemarketing call. the only reason i watched the movie through to the end was that i held out hope that either it would get better or become unintentionally funny. no luck.no disrespect for the supporting cast or for zefferelli's staging, but nothing can make up for the bungling of the main character. i have seen hamlet well-portrayed as an african prince, as an animated lion, as a rough-and-tumble warrior, as a romantic poet, etc. etc. etc. . but imho this portrayal was just a plentiful lack of wit together with most weak hams.

this is by far the worst version of william shakespeare's tragic masterpiece i have ever seen. it seems the filmmakers didn't actually read shakespeare's text. no, they just took what they wanted from the lawerence olivier movie. the plot is out of order and slimmed down to its bare necessity, yet there is time for the non-canon olivier created incest hint between hamlet and queen gertrude. could we have had the "something rotten in the state of denmark" bit instead? casting is another issue. i understand that the far superior branagh movie had its weak bits (robin williams and charlton heston come to mind), but this one has very few good moments. i do like laertes and polonius, but the rest of the cast is stale. mel gibson's creepy stubble is irritating, and one often wonders if he has any idea what he is saying. many of the actors seem to have just memorized the part--they know less about what is being said than sophomores in high school.if you want a version of hamlet, check out kenneth branagh's or even lawerence olivier. to be frank, even disney's hamlet is better.

it's so depressing when film makers try to be cool and it's so obvious here. this has below average acting, laughable dialogue, split screens that are difficult to watch, and many goofs in it's attempt to be a period film and autobiographical. this film should be avoided at all costs. i was told not to go and see this film. i wish i had listened.

when i voted my "1" for this film i noticed that 75 people voted the same out of 146 total votes. that means that half the people that voted for this film feel it's truly terrible. i saw this not long ago at a film festival and i was really unimpressed by it's poor execution. the cinematography is unwatchable, the sound is bad, the story is cut and pasted from many other movies, and the acting is dreadful. this movie is basically a poor rip-off of three other films. no wonder this was never released in the usa.

this movie was so frustrating to watch. the split screens don't allow you to get very involved in the emotions of the actors. i was constantly going back and forth watching all these tiny images that i found myself with wiplash by the end. this is basically a rip off of "the talented mr. ripley" and "timecode" i was very let down with this film makers attempt to be cool. i wish i had walked out like so many other people did.

i saw this film without knowing much about it at all. the split screen device was immediately irritating, and things didn't improve for me after the title sequence had finished. the plot, characters and dialogue were all extremely cliched - poor guy from abusive family gets thrown out of home, wants to get out of his 'lot', reinvents himself, changes his voice, dresses in others' clothes, is adopted by a gay man who he proceeds to disgard on his way up to becoming part of an international set of drug taking british aristocrats.the estate of patricia highsmith (talented mr ripley) should be suing the makers of this film. the triple screen to me, together with the over 120 min duration, emphasises the almost non existent editing. can't decide which image works and is the most powerful, why not show three and hope you get it right with one of them. this gimmick removed any connection or interest i had with any of the characters. important dialogue was repeated 3 times across each screen, as if to say 'this is an important / moving / deep moment, ok!'.don't waste your time.

i was so looking forward to seeing this at the film festival in sydney. i left the theater, like many others, before the end credits because i couldn't sit through it any longer. it was badly shot, the sound sucks, and the acting was worse than an episode of the love boat. now i know why this film hasn't been able to find an american distribution company to release it in the united states. this screams of a low budget high school production.

what can i say about this movie, it really is one of the worst gay themed movies, ever to come out of the uk. i can only imagine the likes of diana quick and georgina hale, needed the money. what story there is, is such a rambling mess that you loose interest pretty quickly. it's supposed to be based on real life events. well, all i can say to that one, is that it's an insult to the real life characters. the dvd is out at the moment in the uk. it's available in either the split screen format, which must make it even worse that the full screen version i watch. gay cinema can be so much better than this, and we deserve more.

what a self-indulgent mess! duncan roy's film is apparently autobiographical, however it's impossible to find any glimmer of emotional truth in this chaotic, badly acted and woefully amateurish fiasco.in a way, you have to admire the balls of a man who through grim determination and a very generous benefactor manages to make a film about his own rise and fall - from abused, working class lad to criminal english lord. however, the tone is either so self-pitying or so arch, that it's impossible to engage with either characters or plot. the raw material is potentially great stuff, however roy seems unable to tease out the kind of tale that should grab you by the throat, then move you to tears. and it's a complete mystery why it was ever made to be screened as a triptych of images - presumably because a single image would have been too tedious to watch.it's also interesting to see so many otherwise good actors - bill nighy, diana quick, lindsay coulson - giving career-worst performances.

i was very interested in seeing this movie despite the article i read about the director in tattler magazine. i don't judge movies by what the director may or may not have done. this debut feature was very difficult to watch. i found the split screens to be a distraction to the drama in the film, some of the supporting characters gave bad performances, and the film to be a copy of several other films i have seen. there really wasn't anything fresh about this

i'm a bit spooked by some of these reviews praising a.k.a. not only do they sound as if they were written by the same person, but they contain all kinds of insider information that surely you could only find by reading the press book from cover to cover. please don't tell me that the director is writing his own reviews as that would just be too sad to contemplate. afraid i'm another one of those who hated the film and was surprised by its unapologetic amateurism. great idea, shame about the execution. and it was most disconcerting to watch so many good actors (as well as some very bad ones including the leaden lead) all apparently thinking that they were appearing in a series of very different films. i wish that a.k.a. had been audacious, innovative or just simply interesting. sadly it was like watching an unintentionally hysterical home video with arty aspirations. a missed opportunity.

unlike one of the reviewers below, i don't think that a great and glittering career should lie ahead for the director of this inept and tedious piece of navel-gazing. whereas it is good to see a british director attempting to break out of the confines of convention, aka's only claim for innovative fame rests on the novelty of the triple screen. at first you think that this might prove to be an interesting device, but its only real contribution to the film is to test your eyesight and patience. seeing the same character from 3 different angles in a 2-dimensional movie does not make it more revealing or complex. if you can forget the triple screen (which, granted, is very hard to do), you then have to deal with the unintentionally hilarious script. the audience is beaten into submission by chiche upon chiche about the british class system. the film has the political and emotional sophistication of an episode of upstairs and downstairs. to sum up: the emperor's new clothes. and a rather poor outfit, too.

aka aspect ratio: 3 x 1.78:1 within 2.39:1 frame (triptych) sound format: dolby digital1978: a working class teenager (matthew leitch) assumes a false identity and gatecrashes high society, where he learns harsh lessons about the divisions between rich and poor.autobiographical feature by director duncan roy (jackson: my life... your fault), an exposé of the pre-thatcherite aristocracy, as seen through the eyes of a low-rent 'commoner' whose world view is transformed by his adventures amongst the upper classes. unfortunately, roy's screenplay says very little we didn't already know about the excesses of the idle rich, and the narrative is only briefly ignited by leitch's relationship with a handsome but self-destructive rent boy (peter youngblood hills) who turns out to be no less hypocritical than the very people he seeks to emulate. also starring diana quick (as an outrageous snob who believes working class people are "embarrassed to be alive"!), bill nighy as the black sheep of a wealthy family, lindsay coulson ("eastenders"), blake ritson (different for girls) and georgina hale in a typically flamboyant cameo, flashing her boobs at all and sundry, without a care in the world! unfortunately, much of the film's impact is diluted by roy's insistence on using a triptych effect (three separate 1.78:1 images are letterboxed within the 2.39:1 frame, each one providing a different viewpoint of individual scenes), which shrinks the image and distances viewers from events on-screen. a long, pointless film, too personal for wide appeal, and hampered throughout by a cinematic process which fails to reconcile the story at hand. a single-image version is also available (framed theatrically at 1.85:1), with the on-screen title aka: lies are like wishes.

duncan roy's writing and direction is really, and regularly, below par. actually it sort of stinks. aka is almost as bad as his recent (horrible, self-serving) remake of dorian gray - absurd, contorted dialogue among the 'upper class' characters, at once idiotic and pretentious, amateurish, stilted to its core. characterisiation and script - and sometimes the acting - is creaky like a school play...but worse, there's a sort of peacock self-certainty about the direction which is just soul destroying when the director clearly hasn't grasped...he's just no good. diana quick must be cringing with embarrassment. dr you should just get out of film...seriously.

as a person who knows the filmed ship and some other ships, too, i cannot see the movie as a movie, only. as a movie is has some great, wonderful shots of the ship, most of them done on an existing vessel - apart of the ones in the disaster scenes, of course, and a certain room under deck. but regarding the story and dialogs i only can call it big crap. nothing of that would happen like this on a real sailing vessel. no wonder, the film had bad impact on the existing ship - if i didn't know better, i wasn't tempted to do a sailing voyage for sure. definitely, for europeans i recommend to switch off once the ship ran aground. after that, the over-emotional, very american part begins which i couldn't bear. the pics are really, really great, no wonder in a ridley scott film, but if you can avoid listening to the text, it will become much better.

the story, as i understand, is "based on real events." that can be either good or bad, depending on what sort of license is taken with those real events and how they are rendered.in this case, the results are enough to gag a maggot. i wasn't expecting much going in -- anticipating a story of rich high-school kids taking an ocean cruise under a stern skipper. that is, what i figured was a coming-of-age movie along the lines of something about boot camp or basic training, the kind in which the drill sergeant says, "my duty is to snap you out of your winsome civilian ways." well, it is that, in a way. the kids start out as kids and end up as an organic group. but this is far hokier than any boot-camp movie i've ever seen, outside of a deliberate comedy. who wrote this thing? the air is filled with slogans that belong, not in high school, but in the third grade. the dialog offends the ear.jeff bridges usually does a better-than-average job but in this case his performance is mediocre. he brings nothing extra to the part, although given his lines, it's hard to know how he could do much with them. the rest of the cast is undistinguished and a few of the kids are painfully inadequate. there's a lot of tearing up, and considerable crying. the best scene involves a dolphin.the immature clichés continue to the very end. the coast guard is cast in the role of the hard-hearted court at the hearing that follows the disaster. the interrogator does nothing but hit bridges over the head with his misinterpretations and misconstruction of events. "you let the crew drink alcohol, didn't you?" (a couple of harmless drinks.) "and you didn't punish them, though you punished them for killing a fish." (the dolphin business.) the technical details surrounding the sinking are left murky. what is a "white squall" anyway? and if it's as dangerous as bridges claims, why weren't the whole crew alerted and wearing life vests? but why go on? if "the albatross" were a dreadnaught, it would still be torpedoed and sunk by the ludicrous comic-book script.

lois weber's film "hypocrites" was and still kind of is a very bold and daring film. i enjoyed it and was very impressed by the filming and story of it. the priest sees the hypocrisy of the people in his church and tries to show them the "naked" truth. the people are appalled when he reveals the naked statue portraying truth, after failing to lead them to it and the few that did, help along the way. the people do not want to face the truth that they are doing anything wrong, but it shows them putting things before god, going to beach parties acting inappropriate, their materialistic ways, and other things in which the people of our world do that tend to not be morally right. in the end, failing to gain any followers, he must enter into the gates of heaven alone. this film seems to me to be very bold, in the fact that a naked woman is shown throughout it, especially considering the time period in which this film was made. the imagery and symbolism portrayed in this movie i found incredible. the way they made the naked woman translucent and using a naked woman to symbolize the naked truth shows a lot of creativity and art. showing the different sins of the people as they walked down the road and refused to follow along the path, each with different excuses, setbacks, and/or higher priorities, was a great way of representing the people of today. this film does a very good job of getting the moral message across to its audience. lois weber has a tremendous way of capturing her spectators' attention with her creativity, symbolism, visuals, and through auditory. even the music of the piano throughout this film is very beautiful and fitting with the whole theme.

the worst movie i've seen in a long time. this whole thing rings false, and the billy crudup character especially so. the potential for a good story is there, but this movie never comes close to delivering. every plot element just drifts away.

the reviewer in variety said this was "overwritten and overlong", and i kind of agree with it. it has some events that seem forced and unlikely, like when cal (crudup once again as the 'lost, vacant, and kind of dull' male) and julianne moore find a map of the us in kind of an unbelievable place. the story is one of those 1970's "guy must find meaning in his life" stories, and i found myself imagining jack nicholson in his prime playing the role of cal. the whole "hitting the road to find meaning in life" theme is still kind of interesting though. does it all really lead back to family? i wasn't so sure. the acting is okay, i particularly liked karen allen and james legross, who unfortunately only have supporting roles. i'd give it a 'five'.

i am one of those people that respect every film-maker as having achieved, each film i watch i usually respect(although i admit i select carefully) and appriciate for what it is. not any more. this is truly one of the worst scripts i have seen produced as a film...so much so i felt compelled to warn others off it. the dialogue was truly unbelievable, the main protaganist was about the last person i would be interested in finding out more about. a scene were an old school friend 'tells it like it is' made me laugh only because it was a pathetic attempt to reveal the subtext of an already concluded plot. the direction is glib at best and at worst film-making by numbers. to compare this film to the atmospheric majesty of a film like five easy pieces is a travesty.

this is one of those road movies that would like to tell you a lotta things about women,the universe,the better life,the terrible solitude of the brilliant architect from manhattan who severs all links with everyone,including his three years old child -which may seem irresponsible to some-actually the hero wins hands down when it comes to selfishness and the scene with his old school pal ,which begins as some kind of good old days conversation and ends on a threatening note is the oasis in a desert movie.the scene with-the-father-who-left-home-when -i-was-a child has been told and told and told.of course it did not prevent the offspring from making his way of life.and when you see the hero's wife's attitude ,you may think she must never have heard about woman's lib.the best is the soundtrack which includes superb songs by willie nelson,tom waits or bonnie raitt...but you can enjoy them without this tedious pretentious work.

this film was so unfocused, rambling and uneven that it was an effort to watch the whole thing. (i actually thought some interesting plot elements might develop.) this was nothing more than a "coming-of-age" film for the thirty-something generation. total crap and i have no idea what julianne moore was doing in this since it was the only reason i picked it off the shelf at the rental store.

what a waste of talent -- although it appears that crudup in real life is a lot more like the vapid, self- absorbed, character-less character he portrays in this disappointing movie.in art, sometimes the empty spaces reveal more than the painted or created content. what this movie reveals is the unconsciousness and the contradictory/competing, unresolved impulses/consciousness of the film's director/writer. it unintentionally shows the lack of awareness that a truly evolved, deeply aware character should have and be tormented about in order to deserve audience empathy or sympathy or the lack of which is used to serve as a cautionary tale to the audience. but this film fails on either level in that regard.the fact that cal, the main character (very much an antagonist, not a protagonist in the true sense of the word), has no empathy for anyone, especially those most deserving of it (which does not include him) and that he has such overblown, entitled, self-pitying, whiney sympathy only for himself, combined with the hallmark lack of remorse and no sense of guilt or awareness of his impact on others -- all converge in this film to make him the epitome of the self-involved, developmentally arrested, narcissistic sociopath -- somehow this is now the gold standard for males on film and in the world at this point and time. one of his counterpoints (james legros) states with a laser-true flash: "i bet you haven't done one good thing in life -- and i bet you won't". it captures the absolute essence of the cal character. something the other characters he bulldozes over in the film seem to realize fairly quickly despite the director having stacked the deck to manipulate sympathy for cal. that is a testament to the supporting cast's talent and skills.cal's eventual 'return' has nothing to do with character development, transformation or evolution of consciousness. it has only to do with the ultimate capitulation that until something better comes along, he may as well be back in his comfy cozy status quo of entitled enablement where the living is easy and no one will demand that he grow up--something of which he is willfully incapable and uninterested in doing.the film could have been pointed and intentional about showing the traps and tragedies -- the devastating effects of this kind of lack of conscience/ consciousness, but it excuses and glorifies it instead -- in fact, it wallows in self-pity right along with the arrogant, selfish, emotionally stunted main character.(and it sure sent chills up my spine when thinking of the recent revelations about convicted murderer scott peterson).if you want to see crudup at his most nuanced and full of an exciting potential that has never been truly realized in my opinion, see the underrated 'inventing the abbotts' ....

the other is a supposed "horror" movie made during the 1970s. it is not to be confused with the similarly titled the others, which starred nicole kidman.the plot is as follows - a woman with strange supernatural powers teaches her twin grandsons something referred to simply as "the game". one of these twin boys - niles - is supposed to be "good". the other one - holland - is supposed to be evil.the idea sounds interesting enough as an abstract concept and the movie was adapted from a novel. i can only hope the novel was interesting as the movie was incredibly boring from beginning to end.the execution of this movie is very much like a tv movie of the kind uk residents might see on channel 5. in fact, this movie looks like it was made to be the daytime afternoon movie for this tv channel. a slight trimming to one or two scenes and this would be a u-rated movie of the kind disney produce. but even the youngest of children are more likely to be bored than scared by the other.you don't need to check out the director's cv to realise horror is not his forte.mr. mulligan relies heavily upon the characters to drive the story. this is obvious from the get-go. i haven't seen any of his other movies but to kill a mockingbird is a highly regarded crime movie on this site. unfortunately in the other, the characters are given too little to do and the plodding script ensures the movie never really takes off in the way one might expect.the direction is as bland as you could possibly find. almost every single scene takes place in the daytime! think about this - a scene shot in the open landscape in rural america during daytime with the camera focusing on vast area. does it sound scary or atmospheric? believe me, it isn't. it comes across as something more akin to an episode of little house on the prairie than a horror movie. and yes, both the aforementioned tv series and the other were shot in california.there is a noticeable absence of danger or malice that makes the whole exercise seem rather pointless.the ending was clearly meant to be highly disturbing and perhaps influenced that of another movie from this time period. i won't reveal which movie but i'll give 2 clues - a young boy was a main character and the movie is well-known. and i'll add that the concept was used to much greater effect in the latter movie.the acting is actually quite good and is the only reason why i have awarded 2 stars. the actors playing the twin boys, along with the actress playing the grandmother, all try hard with the poor material they are given.diana muldaur is completely wasted in a thankless role as the mother of the twin boys. do not be fooled by her high billing on the cast list. she gets very little screen time and her presence just comes across as a ploy to cash-in on her long established tv career in order to help attract tv viewers.i paid careful attention to the blurb on the back of the dvd cover (of the region 2 version in the uk). comparisons were made to the exorcist, which i thought was a complete insult to that movie. there is no comparison. the exorcist had everything this movie should contain but does not - suspense, tension, tongue-in-cheek humour, highly disturbing content, great acting, superb characterisation and viewer involvement. ironically, the exorcist was made only a year later but in terms of style and execution seems like decades ahead of the bland drama known as the other. the other comes across as a work that would have seemed tame in the 1950s let alone the 1970s!the 1970s was a great era for horror movies with classics such as the exorcist, the omen, the texas chainsaw massacre, the legend of hell house, salem's lot to name just a few being produced. for this reason, the other proves an even greater disappointment.if anyone finds the synopsis of the other interesting, they might want to read the book or do a little more research on what the book was about. i would advice everyone to skip the movie.

i can envision the writers of this story thinking up this script:1.let's make a serial killer movie like se7en, knight moves, copycat, and silence of the lambs. people like serial killer stuff. it'll sell... 2.the killer needs to adopt some sort of pattern. i know; he'll copy it out of a serial killer mystery novel. that hasn't been done yet, at least not exactly like that. 3.now, we need some kind of way to make this movie unique; of course, the good guy can be bedridden like in rear window. 4.lastly, we need a twist ending that will give this movie the success of the sixth sense and the usual suspects.okay, now that you know these things, you know the whole movie, so don't waste your money. one thing i really hate about moviemakers is that they take a perfectly good concept for movies and completely run them into the ground. i wrote better stories than this when i was in junior high. i just kept checking my watch every five minutes. when the twist ending finally came, i wasn't shocked, i just said, "oh. who cares?!" the characters are two-dimensional. they have your typical movie personalities. this movie is just proof that stealing the elements of other successful movies is no excuse for a bad script. i give this movie 1 out of 10. normally, it would earn at least 2 or 3, but i'm so sick of the unoriginality. when will they learn? 1/10

*criticism does mention spoilers*i rarely make user comments, but this is one movie i have no problem slandering. this movie stinks, and its mediocre of rating of 6 and a half stars is probably too high for such pulp. the bone collector is not at all the same calibre of film that silence of the lambs or seven were, despite what its ad claims. this is a perfect example of how not to make a thriller. the pace of this movie was extremely slow- i actually left for about 10 minutes half-way through and came back at the exact scene with the exact same character with absolutely no progression (i refer to you the part where angelina jolie's character debates denzel about cutting off a corpse' hands). the movie is not at all scary, but tries to compensate this with a love-subplot albeit sexy angelina jolie's character and denzel washington's. of course, what you get is something comparable to that of the mentor-student relationship as seen in the brillian epic silence of the lambs with hannibal lecter and starling, however, even this lacks all effectiveness and i was personally routing for the villain to kill denzel off so as to avoid hackneyed giggles between the two. with such a crappy movie, i was half-expecting a plot-twist or some sort of spectacular situation to occur at the end to give the movie some credit- things that mediocre movies like arlington road and scream pulled off. anybody with a 4th grade education can see the ending how will be resolved ( a situation which mimicks alfred hitchcock's rear window). the cliche of having the killer explain his motives was uninspired enough, but the reason was so ridiculous and stupid it had me spewing latte over the screen. esoterically speaking, i even think the murderer's intention was completely lost as denzel happily recovers from his loss over the proverbial 'chess game' and gets with his pet project, angelina.if you are a fan of movies with original ideas and genuinely dynamic concepts (like i am), you will not appreciate this film. if you have not attended a single movie in your life and would like to catch-up on every single hollywood cliche ever borne (the late-night knock on the window from somebody else but the murderer, the ridiculous serial-killer to prime investigator relationship, the horrible 'woman trying to get by in an all-male dominated workforce aka sotl) , see this movie....but even then its too slow-paced and you'd be bored.

the storyline has too many flaws and illogical sequences to be worthwhile. jolie's acting is pretty flat and poor, washington's is ok, the rest of the cast are cardboard cutouts. somehow almost everything about this film oozes mediocrity. the plot is lame. the only thing i liked more or less about this film are the fairly original methods the perpetrator uses to end his victims. technical details are worse than the most far-stretched csi 'knowledge' and gizmos and halfway the movie one wonders if the director even cared about detail credibility. (some spoilers hereafter!) i mean, an ekg machine with a pure sinus wave reflecting a man's heartbeat, a quadriplegic with full body muscle spasms and one working index finger, sure. a killer gutting a man's bowels whilst keeping him alive to allow the rats to feast on him followed by a rat aiming for the guy's face! what's with all that stupidity? then there are quite a few continuity goofs, but you can find those elsewhere here on imdb honestly i found it a bit of an insult even to my limited intelligence.waste of time. still 4 out of 10 to keep my girlfriend from kicking me.

i rented this movie primarily because it had meg ryan in it, and i was disappointed to see that her role is really a mere supporting one. not only is she not on screen much, but nothing her character does is essential to the plot. her character could be written out of the story without changing it much.

spoiler alerta cliché-riddled film that somehow makes an anti-death with dignity statement, though it attempts to do the opposite. washington is a paralyzed forensics officer who has been suffering and wanting to die for the past four years (apparently he wrote his huge selling book only a year ago though, so it hasn't all be despair). he arranges for an assisted suicide with his doctor who will return in a week.in the meantime, he helps out on a serial killer case. he recruits the gutsy, i don't wanna do it, but i'm just so good at it, cop jolie, and they track down impossible clue jumping to highly unlikely conclusions in matters of moments. hey, that old bolt means that the killer has the millionaire's wife in a steam tunnel by the old woolworth building. shyeah, right. it's laughable. yet no is smart enough to figure out that doctor who's going to assist him is the killer.when he comes to washington to murder him (ahead of schedule), he has a change of heart and struggles unbelievably for his life. cut to the obligatory bad guy about to shoot the good guy scene when bang the gun goes off--- but the bad guy didn't fire! no the woman steps out of the corner, she has just shot him in the back.

this is one for the golden turkey book. it's another of those "putting on a show" flicks. the dialogue is turgid. the music is terrible. the costumes may be the worst ever. and the nick castle choreography is hilariously dreadful. check it out, oh ye who love bad flicks. only perry como is tolerable.

"d.o.a." is a non-thrilling thriller from directors rocky morton and annabeljankel. the acting is okay and the screenplay is pretty bad. this movie also has some moments which will make you laugh at how stupid the scenes of violenceare. for example, someone is shot near a window. we then see from outsidethe building what looks like that person jumped. i laughed my head off when this happened. this movie tries hard, but ultimately fails. only watch this moviewhen you have no other choice.my critique: **rating: [r]rating reasons: violence and language.**there was no rating reason available due to its age.

possible spoilers --i love dennis quaid and i like meg ryan. i was looking forward to seeing them together, being married and all, i wanted to see their on-screen chemistry. okay, that being said, i guess the fact that they are actors, their off-screen relationship didn't have to permeate their performances, especially with this script.how stupid can a professor be to glue himself to anyone. i don't remember the original, but i can only assume that o'brien probably was handcuffed to his leading lady, probably in a more inevitable way. if i were "bonded" to someone i'd be pretty angry. the crush i would have would definitely have dissipated quickly. meg showed not even a little annoyance only slight surprise. dennis would have to take me kicking and screaming. that whole section of the movie was so horrible -- especially meg having to go to the bathroom (#2) between dumpsters in the dark at night. ewww. no f****ing way! what's with dennis socking every single suspect in the movie. sock first ask questions later. not once, not twice but too many times -- i could have kept count if i were so inclined. the most interesting part of the movie was nick and his family drama. too bad that couldn't have become more of the plot. the assumed off-screen drama leading up to this tragedy. i think it could have been written in without distracting from dex' quest. my blame lies with the writer of this screenplay. unless the director and others doctored it up so much that it's unrecognizable.i won't even get into the real reason poor dex was murdered. how ludicrous is that. even when dex confronted the real killer and the reason was explained, (a true "film noir" moment) everyone on screen seemed bored. oh, _____ happened. oh. (yawn) "dex even says this is a silly reason for a triple murder. oh the tension, you could cut it with a spoon.if anyone but dennis had been in this movie, i'd have to give it 1/2 star (only because i really have seen worse), but in this case 1 1/2 stars.for dennis and meg stars, see anything else.

this review contains a partial spoiler.shallow from the outset, 'd.o.a.' at least starts as if it might be a slick, entertaining piece of nonsense like fincher's 'the game'. it's central character(dennis quaid) suffers from a nightmarish sequence of events that appear to be setting up a twisted and cunning thriller. but the plot rattles along at too great a pace, leading to a dramatic twist not half way through, when the character learns that he has been poisoned and has only 1-2 days to live. and this, simply, is too big a twist to add casually to a story. once this has happened, the film's only chance of success is if it treats the psychology of someone in this situation as its principal, indeed, its only subject matter: but 'd.o.a.' continues as if this was just a normal revelation like any other you might usually encounter in a thriller. the problem is two-fold: firstly, quaid's actions don't convince as what someone is his situation would be likely to do; and secondly, even if they did convince, it's hard to care about what happens next when the most significant point of plot has already been prematurely resolved. the rest of the film is pretty standard fare for a film of this sort, but made more tedious than usual by the character's slightly-treated predicament, which logically dwarfs the events the film is interested in. dennis quaid, in the lead role, doesn't convince either as a burnt out professor or as a man who is destined to die: meg ryan is, as often, ditzy and annoying. another negative feature is the ugly 80s soundtrack. watch 'the game' instead, which from similar roots remains tight and character-driven, whereas 'd.o.a.' drifts into developments that only undermine its own premise. as the premise is itself quite intriguing, it's a shame to see it drowned in a surplus of over-cooked plot.

interesting plot but painfully dull. the script lacks... lacks acting. to me this film compares with "made for tv" type movies. i was lucky to survive the film without falling asleep in my popcorn. i watched this film with my family. it is fairly safe to watch with your kids. (only 1 semi sex scene)if you wish to see a young meg ryan...check out this movie. very 80-ish. you will like this movie if you like the combination of depressed people at christmas, booze, super glue and tar. or maybe you are like me... and have have a higher standard for acting in films. however i did like the way the movie began and ended! mark.

having enjoyed neil gaiman's writing (especially his collaboration with yoshitaka amano in "the dream hunters") in the past, i figured mirrormask to be a sure thing and was very disappointed. the beginning, live-action section of the movie was intriguing enough. the relationships between the characters was believable and easy to empathize with, and i loved the sets, the costuming, and helena's artwork. the subsequent computer-generated scenes, however, were excruciating. the dialogue was awkward and pretentious, the interaction between the live actors and the cgi horrifying. events occurred for the flimsiest reasons, and most events seemed superfluous to whatever plot may have existed. i only watched the first twenty or thirty minutes of the movie, so i'm not exactly an authority, but i strongly recommend that you don't watch any of it at all and stick with gaiman's strong written work.

this film is really really bad, it is not very well done and is a lack lustre attempt at something but i am not sure what. i watched it and was very disappointed. it promised a lot, but delivered nothing at all. the characters are shallow and wooden, and the music, if you can call it that, is dreadful. there are of course all the creatures and animated beings, but they are so poorly done that it does not come across as anything other than a third rate movie. it is a real shame that more attention could not have been spent to the special effects, not the be all and end all of a movie i agree, but in a movie that is based around them, it's a very important factor. for me, a very sad attempt, and should be avoided.

well, that was sure a waste of dave mckean's talents, wasn't it? don't get me wrong: when it comes to graphic design, dave mckean may be the best in the world right now. the layered, textured look he can accomplish with just a few pencil lines on rough paper make the efforts of people like peter greenaway and david fincher look like what they are: hackwork. mckean has been the godfather of a revolution in the look of comics, film, even magazine ads which borrow the distinctive collage effect he has pioneered.but this movie? it's junk. complete junk. the story, from neil gaiman, is, unfortunately, exactly what gaiman has been giving us ever since he ripped off clive barker for the first time: a pseudo-mythic, overblown dreamscape, populated by characters which have titles in all capital letters rather than names. everything is allegory, to the point that it is impossible to get any human drama, emotion, or empathy from anyone involved. people make pithy postulations, speaking in riddles which bring to mind what rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead might have sounded like if tom stoppard had suffered a debilitating stroke halfway through its composition. really, gaiman, get over yourself. you're not a prophet. you're a poser.mckean's directing doesn't help - his pacing is poor, taking fully half an hour to actually rev himself up for the main picaresque plot, and then simply providing a disconnected sequence of events, none of them given any weight. the monsters don't menace because they're not foreshadowed, simply thrown at the screen. the plot doesn't engage because we don't really care about the rancid little protagonists. half the dialogue, muttered into into shirt fronts and ubiquitous masks, is unintelligible.some of the visuals are pretty, and i'm sure the fanboys will lick it up. pity. think of the amount of really good work mckean could have produced if he hadn't been stuck with this lame project.grade: d/d-

wow, what exciting visual effects. i also loved the costumes and artwork, the circus and ethereal feel to the film was sublime. it just required the need for the viewer to worry about the fate of our protagonist. as she is trapped in her imagination, there is never a sense of peril unlike, say, david lynch's films which haunt every time. this also draws attention to which age group this film is aimed at. who would this engage?mirrormask is obviously going to draw comparisons with labyrinth with the teen- angst/ fantasy theme, but unfortunately it doesn't really come close to delivering the same henson essence. the ill mother theme is never fully explained and certainly not something that you care about while lapping up the eye candy.not agonisingly awful a la the cell, nor as engagingly dreamlike as labyrinth - a forgettable but good-looking fantasy.

a pig-tailed linnea quigley drinks milk, strips and kills her sister and her sister's boyfriend after they have sex. she goes to an asylum, makes a best friend out of amy (karen russell) and the two blackmail their way out of a mental institution by sleeping with their psychologists (one is played by "carol burnett show" regular lyle waggoner). on the outside, these two man-hating mafia princesses (!) stop taking their medication and invite six slimeball ex-boyfriends over to their large country home for a party where they're systematically slaughtered in very gory ways by a gloved, leather-clad mystery killer.the hideous david barton fx are so bloody, but so unrealistic that they take on a sort-of surrealistic quality. same goes for the movie. the dialogue is so strange and stilted, the film so ineptly paced and edited and the acting so other-worldly, you'll start to doubt your own sanity. this film actually attempts to have a plot and three-dimensional characters, but it's all so poorly handled it's almost like what would happen if ed wood did a rewrite of an ingmar bergman script! and like any good bergman film, this has a mature moral to abide by--any good party needs a proper guy/girl "ratio," so there will be enough chicks to "tickle your lizard." see it for yourself... or don't!linnea (the only reason i was even interested in watching this to begin with) is very amusing in this one, has a lot more dialogue than usual and has several eye-popping nude scenes. unfortunately, she also completely disappears from the final third of this film and the movie suffers because of it.score: 3 out of 10

preposterous twaddle executed in a bewilderingly amateurish and inept way -- or perhaps several since the incredible lack of continuity, tone, realism, plausibility, suspense, and much more combine with walter pidgeon's bovine attempts at charm to produce a cinema curiosity to rank with some of fritz lang's other stupendous failures. (i thought the german ambassador was actually played by lang but apparently not -- they could have been twins.) if you cannot predict the ending from several timezones away, you are not actually alive.i was eagerly awaiting this dvd and was totally surprised and disappointed by such dire crap (even with george sanders and john carradine -- maybe i can wash my mind out by watching viaggio in italia instead and for the umpteenth time).anyone want a dvd used once? (there may be a movie to be made about the making of this atrocious film and how so many talented people could be wasted so completely.)

essentially a undistinguished b-movie that mysteriously is directed by one of the golden era's major talents, fritz lang. even with the stellar names of lang, walter pidgeon, joan bennett and george sanders, be prepared for a ludicrous storyline, bad acting, patently phony sets and miscasting. for transparency sake, i have to admit i am an ardent non-admirer of walter pidgeon, who was lucky to have found a niche at the artificial dream-factory of mgm, and somehow worked in secondary roles, supporting greer garson and others. he is wildly miscast, acting in a chipper, '30s-ray milland madcap comedy tone, in a role where his life is in danger, and he is in hiding. joan bennett's cockney accent is excessive, but her lacquered hair, perfect makeup and classy outfit belies a street-wise cockney slum-girl. george sanders is incapable of bad acting, but disappears after the preposterous opening finds pidgeon somehow pretending to shoot adolph hitler. surprising for fritz lang is the unevenness of tone. i found the film wavered uneasily between occasional moments of suspense-thriller surrounded by light-hearted comedic interplay. hitchcock totally reversed the ratio, using comic relief to occasionally pace the suspense. there is a reason this film is unknown. it didn't serve or propel anybody's career or reputation, and is forgotten because it's a surprisingly bad film from such a pedigreed group.

disappointing film with walter pidgeon as a hunter who goes to germany to assassinate hitler. when he is discovered, he is coerced into signing a document stating that he acted on orders from england. his refusal to sign the document brings us to the plot of the film.pidgeon is pursued back to england by the evil george sanders and his cohort, john carradine, who speaks little, but is again as always, the embodiment of wickedness personified.along the way of being pursued, pidgeon meets up with joan bennett, the latter displaying a wonderful cockney accent.the story gets bogged down somewhat as love develops between the two, but again as we approach world war 11, realism becomes the object of the day.the near-ending scene in the cave between sanders and pidgeon is nicely realized but we know where that arrow is going to go to.very interesting that while pidgeon is fleeing nazi germany, he meets up again with a young roddy mcdowall, one of pidgeon's many co-stars that same year in the memorable "how green was my valley." how green was "man hunt?"

i am assuming that the rave reviews on this page were from people who have never read the book - unfortunately for those of us who love the text, hollywood outdid itself on destroying this one.i am not sure where on earth the woman love-interest came from, except that she replaced the cat, nor why our rogue male acquired a helpful family back in blighty - in fact the vast majority of the book has been cut out and replaced with your standard cruddy love story. the ambiguity about which world leader was in his sights was removed completely and our rogue was given a name (neither of these appeared until the second book).i gave it a 2 rather than a 1 simply because of the wonderfully bad cockney accents. joan bennett outdoes dick van dyke in mary poppins by miles and this goes a tiny way towards saving it.ah well - brits should probably avoid this. trust me :)
